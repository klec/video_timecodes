00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.030
Hi guys.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040
Hi guys.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.070
Hi guys. [Music]

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.509
Uh yeah, as always, let's wait for

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519
Uh yeah, as always, let's wait for

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.470
Uh yeah, as always, let's wait for others. Uh let's give them like five

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480
others. Uh let's give them like five

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.870
others. Uh let's give them like five minutes. Okay,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.230
I have some questions there. Uh so I'm

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240
I have some questions there. Uh so I'm

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.390
I have some questions there. Uh so I'm not sure about this training. So, do we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400
not sure about this training. So, do we

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.670
not sure about this training. So, do we have those calls on uh weekend as well?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680
have those calls on uh weekend as well?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.910
have those calls on uh weekend as well? I mean, Saturday and Sunday.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
I mean, Saturday and Sunday.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.270
I mean, Saturday and Sunday. No, no, Monday, Wednesday, next week.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280
No, no, Monday, Wednesday, next week.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.910
No, no, Monday, Wednesday, next week. Okay. Mon. Yeah. Okay. Cuz in my

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920
Okay. Mon. Yeah. Okay. Cuz in my

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.869
Okay. Mon. Yeah. Okay. Cuz in my calendar it like sounds different. Okay.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
calendar it like sounds different. Okay.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.510
calendar it like sounds different. Okay. So, it's this week that's live day then

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
So, it's this week that's live day then

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670
So, it's this week that's live day then next week.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
next week.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.709
next week. Yes. So, weekend is off and then we have

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719
Yes. So, weekend is off and then we have

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.270
Yes. So, weekend is off and then we have three days more.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
three days more.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:05.189
three days more. Yep. Okay. Sounds good.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.670
Okay guys, since uh you are here, we'll

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
Okay guys, since uh you are here, we'll

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.149
Okay guys, since uh you are here, we'll others will probably join in a moment.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159
others will probably join in a moment.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.149
others will probably join in a moment. Uh so my idea is to do also the theory

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
Uh so my idea is to do also the theory

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.350
Uh so my idea is to do also the theory first today. So all the guys from

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360
first today. So all the guys from

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.550
first today. So all the guys from Falcrum you'll be able to uh then go

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
Falcrum you'll be able to uh then go

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.429
Falcrum you'll be able to uh then go because you want to do practice outside.

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
because you want to do practice outside.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.630
because you want to do practice outside. So uh we have only one theory topic for

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640
So uh we have only one theory topic for

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.789
So uh we have only one theory topic for today. So I will again switch the order.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799
today. So I will again switch the order.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.390
today. So I will again switch the order. So we'll do the theory for the ACL and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400
So we'll do the theory for the ACL and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.270
So we'll do the theory for the ACL and then we'll go back

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
then we'll go back

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.429
then we'll go back uh to the practice about view page

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
uh to the practice about view page

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.310
uh to the practice about view page and all the scrut

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
and all the scrut

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.990
and all the scrut okay. Do you have anything against?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.990
Okay.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
Okay.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.990
Okay. I will start slowly. So if

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000
I will start slowly. So if

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.469
I will start slowly. So if someone wants to join then

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.869
okay

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
okay

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.910
okay I send you slides already so you should

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920
I send you slides already so you should

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.070
I send you slides already so you should have it.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
have it.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.309
have it. And for now I'm going to close the topic

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319
And for now I'm going to close the topic

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.150
And for now I'm going to close the topic number six. We're going to go back to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160
number six. We're going to go back to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.710
number six. We're going to go back to the practice just after the theory.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
the practice just after the theory.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.710
the practice just after the theory. Um okay.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.309
Um so the topic is about ACL like

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319
Um so the topic is about ACL like

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.869
Um so the topic is about ACL like basically about the security and how we

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879
basically about the security and how we

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.030
basically about the security and how we do it uh in Oro. Uh so in general I'm

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
do it uh in Oro. Uh so in general I'm

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
do it uh in Oro. Uh so in general I'm sure you know or what we have security

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
sure you know or what we have security

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.070
sure you know or what we have security and uh probably most you would like to

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
and uh probably most you would like to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.550
and uh probably most you would like to protect all the entities

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
protect all the entities

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.990
protect all the entities uh or all the actions like create, view,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
uh or all the actions like create, view,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.150
uh or all the actions like create, view, update and so on.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
update and so on.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.190
update and so on. Uh so here our general idea is that um

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
Uh so here our general idea is that um

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.309
Uh so here our general idea is that um we have user roles for back office we

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319
we have user roles for back office we

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.309
we have user roles for back office we have separate entity for storefront we

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319
have separate entity for storefront we

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.350
have separate entity for storefront we have separate entity. Uh so for back

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
have separate entity. Uh so for back

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.149
have separate entity. Uh so for back office our users are here. Those are

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159
office our users are here. Those are

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.750
office our users are here. Those are users and roles are here. For storefront

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
users and roles are here. For storefront

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.070
users and roles are here. For storefront we have customer users and customer user

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080
we have customer users and customer user

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.550
we have customer users and customer user roles. But I will show you in a moment.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
roles. But I will show you in a moment.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.030
roles. But I will show you in a moment. Uh actually at the end I will show you

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040
Uh actually at the end I will show you

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.710
Uh actually at the end I will show you customer user entities. Um now we're

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720
customer user entities. Um now we're

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.390
customer user entities. Um now we're going to talk about those users and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400
going to talk about those users and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.509
going to talk about those users and those roles back office roles. Uh but uh

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
those roles back office roles. Uh but uh

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.149
those roles back office roles. Uh but uh in general the idea is exactly the same.

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159
in general the idea is exactly the same.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.070
in general the idea is exactly the same. Uh how we use it is exactly the same.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080
Uh how we use it is exactly the same.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.910
Uh how we use it is exactly the same. You will also see all the edit page.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.789
Hi, we just started so you didn't miss a

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799
Hi, we just started so you didn't miss a

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.309
Hi, we just started so you didn't miss a lot.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
lot.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.430
lot. Uh so you'll see that though we have

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
Uh so you'll see that though we have

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.430
Uh so you'll see that though we have different role entities for back office

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
different role entities for back office

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.589
different role entities for back office and for storefront they look pretty

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599
and for storefront they look pretty

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.070
and for storefront they look pretty similar and the functionality behind

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080
similar and the functionality behind

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.270
similar and the functionality behind this it's actually identical. Uh we just

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280
this it's actually identical. Uh we just

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.270
this it's actually identical. Uh we just have different entities uh because we

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280
have different entities uh because we

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.589
have different entities uh because we have different user entities.

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599
have different user entities.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.149
have different user entities. Uh so permissions are assigned to roles.

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159
Uh so permissions are assigned to roles.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.070
Uh so permissions are assigned to roles. We do not assign a permission directly

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080
We do not assign a permission directly

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.390
We do not assign a permission directly to some users. We create a role as a set

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400
to some users. We create a role as a set

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.190
to some users. We create a role as a set of permissions that tell us that user

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
of permissions that tell us that user

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.270
of permissions that tell us that user that has this role will be able to do

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280
that has this role will be able to do

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.789
that has this role will be able to do something.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799
something.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.229
something. So then our user uh can have one or more

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239
So then our user uh can have one or more

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.030
So then our user uh can have one or more role. So if I have two roles and uh I

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040
role. So if I have two roles and uh I

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.030
role. So if I have two roles and uh I have like a sum of um permissions. So if

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040
have like a sum of um permissions. So if

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.870
have like a sum of um permissions. So if role A doesn't have permission to

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880
role A doesn't have permission to

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.150
role A doesn't have permission to some entity but role B has permission

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160
some entity but role B has permission

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.790
some entity but role B has permission and I have both roles at the end I will

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
and I have both roles at the end I will

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.830
and I have both roles at the end I will have permission. So allowing access

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
have permission. So allowing access

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.230
have permission. So allowing access wins.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240
wins.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.150
wins. Um now all of this uh inside those roles

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160
Um now all of this uh inside those roles

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.629
Um now all of this uh inside those roles will be able to specify what I as a

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639
will be able to specify what I as a

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.749
will be able to specify what I as a login logged in user what I can see and

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759
login logged in user what I can see and

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.909
login logged in user what I can see and this will also have some levels of

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919
this will also have some levels of

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.510
this will also have some levels of visibility. So I will be able to have a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520
visibility. So I will be able to have a

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.909
visibility. So I will be able to have a contacts list but sometimes some users

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919
contacts list but sometimes some users

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.430
contacts list but sometimes some users uh will see all the contacts some only

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440
uh will see all the contacts some only

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.189
uh will see all the contacts some only contacts that they created and uh or all

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199
contacts that they created and uh or all

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.110
contacts that they created and uh or all the contacts from uh their business

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120
the contacts from uh their business

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.230
the contacts from uh their business unit. Um and this is the skiery that we

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240
unit. Um and this is the skiery that we

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.469
unit. Um and this is the skiery that we have in a back office. So first of all

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479
have in a back office. So first of all

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.469
have in a back office. So first of all we have organization.

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479
we have organization.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.590
we have organization. Uh then in the organization we have

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600
Uh then in the organization we have

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.590
Uh then in the organization we have business units and you can have multiple

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600
business units and you can have multiple

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.990
business units and you can have multiple business units in one organization and

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000
business units in one organization and

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.110
business units in one organization and they can also be um built as a tree. So

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120
they can also be um built as a tree. So

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.029
they can also be um built as a tree. So we have main business unit and some

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039
we have main business unit and some

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.110
we have main business unit and some child business units. Okay. So Acme

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
child business units. Okay. So Acme

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.110
child business units. Okay. So Acme general is a main business units

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120
general is a main business units

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.830
general is a main business units business unit and then this uh acme

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840
business unit and then this uh acme

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.230
business unit and then this uh acme general has two child business units

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240
general has two child business units

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.029
general has two child business units acme east and acme west. So here we can

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039
acme east and acme west. So here we can

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.150
acme east and acme west. So here we can also build a structure from it. Uh so

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160
also build a structure from it. Uh so

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.990
also build a structure from it. Uh so for example you can have a company and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000
for example you can have a company and

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.390
for example you can have a company and company can have divisions and those

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400
company can have divisions and those

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.029
company can have divisions and those divisions can have hierarchy and this is

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039
divisions can have hierarchy and this is

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.710
divisions can have hierarchy and this is exactly what we will do with business

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720
exactly what we will do with business

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.590
exactly what we will do with business units. Then whenever you create the user

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600
units. Then whenever you create the user

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.590
units. Then whenever you create the user you assign user to some particular

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600
you assign user to some particular

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.870
you assign user to some particular business unit. Okay. So we have this uh

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880
business unit. Okay. So we have this uh

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.590
business unit. Okay. So we have this uh organizations, business units and user

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600
organizations, business units and user

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.270
organizations, business units and user are assigned to business unit

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280
are assigned to business unit

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.430
are assigned to business unit and based all those on those levels like

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440
and based all those on those levels like

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.670
and based all those on those levels like user, business unit, organization. I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680
user, business unit, organization. I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.150
user, business unit, organization. I will show you in a moment uh how and

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160
will show you in a moment uh how and

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.150
will show you in a moment uh how and what to do to be able to uh give access

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160
what to do to be able to uh give access

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.270
what to do to be able to uh give access to different set of records uh per role.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280
to different set of records uh per role.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.749
to different set of records uh per role. Um so uh connected to this oh actually I

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759
Um so uh connected to this oh actually I

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.189
Um so uh connected to this oh actually I haven't uh showing you the RO. Okay. So,

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199
haven't uh showing you the RO. Okay. So,

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.870
haven't uh showing you the RO. Okay. So, how this RO

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.270
uh looks

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280
uh looks

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.790
uh looks those are my roles and inside I can

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800
those are my roles and inside I can

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.469
those are my roles and inside I can specify

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479
specify

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.710
specify uh particular permissions. So, per

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720
uh particular permissions. So, per

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.469
uh particular permissions. So, per entity and per action and then we also

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479
entity and per action and then we also

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.230
entity and per action and then we also have

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240
have

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.189
have um like permissions like I can do

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199
um like permissions like I can do

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.670
um like permissions like I can do something or not. So, true false. I will

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680
something or not. So, true false. I will

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.670
something or not. So, true false. I will show you in a moment in details how to

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680
show you in a moment in details how to

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.309
show you in a moment in details how to add this, how to add those, how to

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319
add this, how to add those, how to

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.350
add this, how to add those, how to specify all this. So this is how the

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360
specify all this. So this is how the

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.070
specify all this. So this is how the back office user role edit edit looks

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080
back office user role edit edit looks

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.790
back office user role edit edit looks like and for the customer user roles.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800
like and for the customer user roles.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.749
like and for the customer user roles. So the storefront role uh we have

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759
So the storefront role uh we have

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.510
So the storefront role uh we have different set of roles but inside the

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520
different set of roles but inside the

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.589
different set of roles but inside the idea is the same. We also have set of

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599
idea is the same. We also have set of

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.469
idea is the same. We also have set of entities and permissions per action.

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479
entities and permissions per action.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.189
entities and permissions per action. Then also some additional actions. Okay.

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199
Then also some additional actions. Okay.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.909
Then also some additional actions. Okay. And uh for storefront rows we can have

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919
And uh for storefront rows we can have

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.629
And uh for storefront rows we can have different set of entities. Then we have

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639
different set of entities. Then we have

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.029
different set of entities. Then we have for back office which is true because

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039
for back office which is true because

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.870
for back office which is true because here the list is very very very long. I

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880
here the list is very very very long. I

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.589
here the list is very very very long. I can scroll down and scroll down and yep

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599
can scroll down and scroll down and yep

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.589
can scroll down and scroll down and yep and here we have totally different set

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599
and here we have totally different set

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.029
and here we have totally different set of entities. How to specify uh which

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039
of entities. How to specify uh which

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.270
of entities. How to specify uh which entity goes where? I'll show you that

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280
entity goes where? I'll show you that

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.270
entity goes where? I'll show you that during this topic.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.830
Uh okay. So strongly connected to that

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840
Uh okay. So strongly connected to that

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.950
Uh okay. So strongly connected to that part is an ownership. So your entity

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960
part is an ownership. So your entity

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.150
part is an ownership. So your entity doesn't need to have an owner. It uh but

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160
doesn't need to have an owner. It uh but

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.070
doesn't need to have an owner. It uh but you can specify ownership for this

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
you can specify ownership for this

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.589
you can specify ownership for this entity and this owner can be represented

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599
entity and this owner can be represented

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.830
entity and this owner can be represented by one of those entities. This can be a

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840
by one of those entities. This can be a

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.390
by one of those entities. This can be a user, business unit uh or organization.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400
user, business unit uh or organization.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.430
user, business unit uh or organization. Uh and then this ownership can be check

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440
Uh and then this ownership can be check

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.950
Uh and then this ownership can be check can be used uh will be used uh to check

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960
can be used uh will be used uh to check

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.790
can be used uh will be used uh to check permissions.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800
permissions.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.909
permissions. Um so what does it mean? If you set up

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919
Um so what does it mean? If you set up

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.230
Um so what does it mean? If you set up your entity

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240
your entity

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.509
your entity and you say that it has user owner

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519
and you say that it has user owner

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.709
and you say that it has user owner whenever I let's stick to the contact

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
whenever I let's stick to the contact

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.310
whenever I let's stick to the contact whenever I um logged in as some user

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320
whenever I um logged in as some user

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.350
whenever I um logged in as some user whenever I create a contact additionally

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360
whenever I create a contact additionally

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.509
whenever I create a contact additionally we will save the information about my

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519
we will save the information about my

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.070
we will save the information about my user ID so we will have the information

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080
user ID so we will have the information

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.430
user ID so we will have the information exactly which user created this contact

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440
exactly which user created this contact

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.070
exactly which user created this contact and then if you decide that owner is not

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080
and then if you decide that owner is not

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.750
and then if you decide that owner is not user but only business unit Then uh we

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760
user but only business unit Then uh we

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.030
user but only business unit Then uh we will save only the business unit ID that

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040
will save only the business unit ID that

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.670
will save only the business unit ID that I belong to. So you will lose

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680
I belong to. So you will lose

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.230
I belong to. So you will lose information who exactly created this

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240
information who exactly created this

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.310
information who exactly created this contact. You will have only information

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320
contact. You will have only information

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.150
contact. You will have only information from which business unit this person

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160
from which business unit this person

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.870
from which business unit this person was. Okay. And same goes for the

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880
was. Okay. And same goes for the

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.910
was. Okay. And same goes for the organization. So you'll only have

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920
organization. So you'll only have

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.910
organization. So you'll only have information about the organization that

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920
information about the organization that

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.670
information about the organization that this user belongs to.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680
this user belongs to.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.190
this user belongs to. Um

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200
Um

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.670
Um and later we'll be able to uh filter out

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680
and later we'll be able to uh filter out

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.350
and later we'll be able to uh filter out the list of for example contacts based

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360
the list of for example contacts based

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.630
the list of for example contacts based on the ownership. How in a second. Uh

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640
on the ownership. How in a second. Uh

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.269
on the ownership. How in a second. Uh how to define this ownership? Uh we did

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279
how to define this ownership? Uh we did

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.269
how to define this ownership? Uh we did it in the entity configuration. So in

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279
it in the entity configuration. So in

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.350
it in the entity configuration. So in this at config s section on our entity

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360
this at config s section on our entity

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.550
this at config s section on our entity and here

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560
and here

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.670
and here yes this is in the at config section. Uh

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680
yes this is in the at config section. Uh

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.230
yes this is in the at config section. Uh and we have the ownership section here

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240
and we have the ownership section here

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.350
and we have the ownership section here and we can specify owner type user. We

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360
and we can specify owner type user. We

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.750

organization. Let me show you the rest.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680
Let me show you the rest.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.150
Let me show you the rest. Owner type user business unit

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160
Owner type user business unit

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.509
Owner type user business unit organization. So basically the keywords

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.670
and then

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680
and then

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.110
and then this user needs to have be available as

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120
this user needs to have be available as

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.430
this user needs to have be available as a field on our entity. Right? So this is

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440
a field on our entity. Right? So this is

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.630
a field on our entity. Right? So this is entity contact and this contact entity

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640
entity contact and this contact entity

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.870
entity contact and this contact entity will have owner field. Okay. And in the

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880
will have owner field. Okay. And in the

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.430
will have owner field. Okay. And in the database uh the column will be user

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440
database uh the column will be user

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.389
database uh the column will be user owner owner ID. So you need to put it

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399
owner owner ID. So you need to put it

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.949
owner owner ID. So you need to put it here. uh for the ownership to work, you

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959
here. uh for the ownership to work, you

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:41.030
here. uh for the ownership to work, you always need to also add uh organization.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040
always need to also add uh organization.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.110
always need to also add uh organization. Uh so you need to have organization in

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120
Uh so you need to have organization in

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.110
Uh so you need to have organization in order for the ownership to work. And

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120
order for the ownership to work. And

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.269
order for the ownership to work. And then you can save additional data like

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279
then you can save additional data like

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:51.030
then you can save additional data like user or business unit. Um

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040
user or business unit. Um

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.190
user or business unit. Um if you use organization then you just

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200
if you use organization then you just

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.910
if you use organization then you just don't need those two fields. This will

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920
don't need those two fields. This will

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.470
don't need those two fields. This will be enough.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480
be enough.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.110
be enough. Um and this is it. Remember after

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120
Um and this is it. Remember after

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.670
Um and this is it. Remember after executing this part you need to execute

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680
executing this part you need to execute

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.710
executing this part you need to execute the command to update uh entity config

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720
the command to update uh entity config

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.590
the command to update uh entity config and you also need to create this field

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600
and you also need to create this field

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.030
and you also need to create this field right. So this will not in the

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
right. So this will not in the

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.870
right. So this will not in the background do the migration for you. You

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880
background do the migration for you. You

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.190
background do the migration for you. You need to end the migration and create

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200
need to end the migration and create

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.509
need to end the migration and create this uh field.

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.230
Okay.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240
Okay.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.829
Okay. Uh so once we have the ownership or or

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839
Uh so once we have the ownership or or

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.670
Uh so once we have the ownership or or not because some entities will have

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680
not because some entities will have

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.470
not because some entities will have ownership, some will not.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480
ownership, some will not.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.350
ownership, some will not. Um we can go back to this uh security

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360
Um we can go back to this uh security

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.949
Um we can go back to this uh security part. So as you saw on the role uh edit

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959
part. So as you saw on the role uh edit

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.590
part. So as you saw on the role uh edit page, we have two type of ACL. First

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600
page, we have two type of ACL. First

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.470
page, we have two type of ACL. First part is entity based and this goes to

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480
part is entity based and this goes to

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.069
part is entity based and this goes to this part. So per entity we can specify

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079
this part. So per entity we can specify

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.870
this part. So per entity we can specify if I can view, create, edit, delete,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880
if I can view, create, edit, delete,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.630
if I can view, create, edit, delete, assign and some others.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:52.640
assign and some others.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.350
assign and some others. Uh then second part is action based

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360
Uh then second part is action based

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.509
Uh then second part is action based so-called capabilities. We call them

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519
so-called capabilities. We call them

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:02.790
so-called capabilities. We call them capabilities and those are um

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800
capabilities and those are um

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.870
capabilities and those are um like

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880
like

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.150
like um yes no values. So if you want to

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160
um yes no values. So if you want to

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.350
um yes no values. So if you want to check something uh uh if you want to

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360
check something uh uh if you want to

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.190
check something uh uh if you want to restrict something that is not connected

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200
restrict something that is not connected

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.269
restrict something that is not connected to an entity but you just want to allow

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279
to an entity but you just want to allow

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.910
to an entity but you just want to allow someone to export grid view for example.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920
someone to export grid view for example.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.790
someone to export grid view for example. Right? So this is not connected to any

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800
Right? So this is not connected to any

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.350
Right? So this is not connected to any entity or anything. So you just create

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360
entity or anything. So you just create

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.990
entity or anything. So you just create that kind of rule and that kind of uh

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000
that kind of rule and that kind of uh

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.629
that kind of rule and that kind of uh ACL permission and it's going to be true

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639
ACL permission and it's going to be true

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.509
ACL permission and it's going to be true false. Okay. So when I edit I can

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519
false. Okay. So when I edit I can

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:35.030
false. Okay. So when I edit I can basically just say that okay I can do it

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040
basically just say that okay I can do it

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.790
basically just say that okay I can do it or I cannot do it. Okay.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.269
Um

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.870
uh so what about those entity

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880
uh so what about those entity

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.750
uh so what about those entity permissions? As you saw by default we

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760
permissions? As you saw by default we

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.910
permissions? As you saw by default we have view, create, edit, delete and

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920
have view, create, edit, delete and

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.030
have view, create, edit, delete and assign. Uh and they are all defined in

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040
assign. Uh and they are all defined in

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.910
assign. Uh and they are all defined in the YAML file in this YAML file. Those

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920
the YAML file in this YAML file. Those

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.230
the YAML file in this YAML file. Those are actually defined as available for

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240
are actually defined as available for

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.470
are actually defined as available for every entity.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480
every entity.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.069
every entity. Uh and then

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079
Uh and then

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.590
Uh and then um

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600
um

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.790
um let me go to edit page of administrator

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800
let me go to edit page of administrator

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.949
let me go to edit page of administrator once more.

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959
once more.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.870
once more. Uh and then based on the ownership

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880
Uh and then based on the ownership

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.310
Uh and then based on the ownership we can have different levels per each

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320
we can have different levels per each

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.670
we can have different levels per each action. So without ownership we can only

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680
action. So without ownership we can only

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.550
action. So without ownership we can only say that someone let's do that this on

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560
say that someone let's do that this on

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.670
say that someone let's do that this on the view example. We have contact entity

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680
the view example. We have contact entity

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.310
the view example. We have contact entity and we have view setting.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320
and we have view setting.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.990
and we have view setting. So we have contact entity and we have

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
So we have contact entity and we have

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.870
So we have contact entity and we have view setting here. Actually I have more

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880
view setting here. Actually I have more

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.629
view setting here. Actually I have more levels because contact has uh ownership

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639
levels because contact has uh ownership

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:47.030
levels because contact has uh ownership turned on. Uh for the entity that

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040
turned on. Uh for the entity that

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.350
turned on. Uh for the entity that doesn't have ownership we'll have only

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360
doesn't have ownership we'll have only

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.430
doesn't have ownership we'll have only two levels none and global.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440
two levels none and global.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.350
two levels none and global. Um

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.230
okay none and global so if the entity

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240
okay none and global so if the entity

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.990
okay none and global so if the entity doesn't have ownership the only thing

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000
doesn't have ownership the only thing

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.230
doesn't have ownership the only thing that I can do from here it's say that I

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240
that I can do from here it's say that I

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.069
that I can do from here it's say that I can view all the those entities or I

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079
can view all the those entities or I

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:13.829
can view all the those entities or I cannot view none okay so either all or

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839
cannot view none okay so either all or

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:16.629
cannot view none okay so either all or nothing because we don't have ownership

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639
nothing because we don't have ownership

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:19.509
nothing because we don't have ownership on this entity we don't know who created

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519
on this entity we don't know who created

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.629
on this entity we don't know who created uh each particular entity so we can only

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639
uh each particular entity so we can only

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.949
uh each particular entity so we can only say I can see everything or or I can see

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959
say I can see everything or or I can see

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:29.350
say I can see everything or or I can see nothing. But if we have owner,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360
nothing. But if we have owner,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.990
nothing. But if we have owner, where is my contact?

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000
where is my contact?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.310
where is my contact? Then we have actually more levels. For

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320
Then we have actually more levels. For

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.230
Then we have actually more levels. For the enterprise edition, we will have

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240
the enterprise edition, we will have

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.550
the enterprise edition, we will have also organization level here between

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560
also organization level here between

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.030
also organization level here between division and global because we we will

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040
division and global because we we will

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.949
division and global because we we will be able to have multiple organizations.

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959
be able to have multiple organizations.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.870
be able to have multiple organizations. For single organization, this level

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880
For single organization, this level

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.389
For single organization, this level doesn't make sense. That's why it's not

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399
doesn't make sense. That's why it's not

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.550
doesn't make sense. That's why it's not here. But normally it will have also

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560
here. But normally it will have also

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.430
here. But normally it will have also organization level here. So what this

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440
organization level here. So what this

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.389
organization level here. So what this gives us whenever I have an ownership on

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399
gives us whenever I have an ownership on

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:57.509
gives us whenever I have an ownership on my entity and let's say first example

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519
my entity and let's say first example

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:00.389
my entity and let's say first example the ownership is set to user. So when I

00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399
the ownership is set to user. So when I

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:03.269
the ownership is set to user. So when I log in and create a contact we

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279
log in and create a contact we

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:06.790
log in and create a contact we additionally save my user ID to this

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800
additionally save my user ID to this

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.870
additionally save my user ID to this contact entity. So we have information

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880
contact entity. So we have information

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.269
contact entity. So we have information which user created it and because of

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279
which user created it and because of

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:14.150
which user created it and because of that we can we have here level user

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160
that we can we have here level user

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.150
that we can we have here level user which will mean that whoever gets this

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160
which will mean that whoever gets this

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.990
which will mean that whoever gets this role has access to see contacts but only

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000
role has access to see contacts but only

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.189
role has access to see contacts but only created by himself. So when I now enter

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199
created by himself. So when I now enter

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:26.389
created by himself. So when I now enter the contact uh list page the contact

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399
the contact uh list page the contact

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.710
the contact uh list page the contact index page with the data grid I will not

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720
index page with the data grid I will not

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.110
index page with the data grid I will not have all contacts on the data grid but

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120
have all contacts on the data grid but

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.990
have all contacts on the data grid but only those that I created because my

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000
only those that I created because my

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.910
only those that I created because my level of visibility is user. Okay.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920
level of visibility is user. Okay.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.350
level of visibility is user. Okay. Uh then you can also uh set here

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360
Uh then you can also uh set here

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.710
Uh then you can also uh set here business unit. Uh so we are saving

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720
business unit. Uh so we are saving

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.069
business unit. Uh so we are saving information which user created it. So we

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079
information which user created it. So we

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.629
information which user created it. So we also kind of have information up right

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639
also kind of have information up right

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.110
also kind of have information up right in which business unit was uh this

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120
in which business unit was uh this

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.829
in which business unit was uh this person. So if you create a role for me

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839
person. So if you create a role for me

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.389
person. So if you create a role for me and set a business unit level here for

00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399
and set a business unit level here for

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:01.829
and set a business unit level here for the view, it will uh act as when I go to

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839
the view, it will uh act as when I go to

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.990
the view, it will uh act as when I go to the contact list, I will see all the

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000
the contact list, I will see all the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.430
the contact list, I will see all the contacts that I created and all other

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440
contacts that I created and all other

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.790
contacts that I created and all other users from my business unit. So I will

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800
users from my business unit. So I will

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.990
users from my business unit. So I will see a little bit bigger list. Then you

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000
see a little bit bigger list. Then you

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.749
see a little bit bigger list. Then you can also switch it to division which

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759
can also switch it to division which

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:19.110
can also switch it to division which will mean uh all contacts created by me,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120
will mean uh all contacts created by me,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.670
will mean uh all contacts created by me, all users from my business unit and all

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680
all users from my business unit and all

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.949
all users from my business unit and all users from child business units and then

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959
users from child business units and then

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.949
users from child business units and then uh we also have organization here

00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959
uh we also have organization here

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.509
uh we also have organization here normally and global means everything.

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519
normally and global means everything.

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:32.150
normally and global means everything. Okay. So this is why this ownership is

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160
Okay. So this is why this ownership is

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.629
Okay. So this is why this ownership is so important. Whenever you create an

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639
so important. Whenever you create an

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:38.150
so important. Whenever you create an entity and uh set ownership, you need to

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160
entity and uh set ownership, you need to

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.150
entity and uh set ownership, you need to think for the future. Um

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160
think for the future. Um

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.110
think for the future. Um because if you decide to go not with

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120
because if you decide to go not with

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.550
because if you decide to go not with user but with business unit then here

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560
user but with business unit then here

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.870
user but with business unit then here you will not have this user level right

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880
you will not have this user level right

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.670
you will not have this user level right because you will keep only information

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680
because you will keep only information

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.189
because you will keep only information uh from which business unit was the user

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199
uh from which business unit was the user

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:02.230
uh from which business unit was the user that created it right so if you later

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240
that created it right so if you later

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.069
that created it right so if you later would like with ACL show only contacts

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079
would like with ACL show only contacts

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.630
would like with ACL show only contacts that create were created by particular

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640
that create were created by particular

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.710
that create were created by particular user you won't be able to do it right

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720
user you won't be able to do it right

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.909
user you won't be able to do it right because your uh ownership level imagine

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919
because your uh ownership level imagine

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.990
because your uh ownership level imagine here it's business unit. So you're not

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000
here it's business unit. So you're not

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.150
here it's business unit. So you're not keeping information which user created

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160
keeping information which user created

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.630
keeping information which user created that. That's why it's so important to

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640
that. That's why it's so important to

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.549
that. That's why it's so important to think about it at the beginning because

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559
think about it at the beginning because

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:25.029
think about it at the beginning because based on this ownership

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039
based on this ownership

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:27.429
based on this ownership uh we will save some additional

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439
uh we will save some additional

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.750
uh we will save some additional information about the owner and we will

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760
information about the owner and we will

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.110
information about the owner and we will have different levels in here.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.909
Um okay so for and without ownership

00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919
Um okay so for and without ownership

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:42.390
Um okay so for and without ownership only n and global and with ownership we

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400
only n and global and with ownership we

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.350
only n and global and with ownership we have levels levels based on the

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360
have levels levels based on the

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.470
have levels levels based on the ownership. So for the user owner we have

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480
ownership. So for the user owner we have

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.669
ownership. So for the user owner we have all the levels for the business unit uh

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679
all the levels for the business unit uh

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:54.150
all the levels for the business unit uh owner we will have everything except the

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160
owner we will have everything except the

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.270
owner we will have everything except the user and so on and so on.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.310
Um okay

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320
Um okay

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.870
Um okay so uh disregarding the fact if we have

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880
so uh disregarding the fact if we have

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.590
so uh disregarding the fact if we have ownership or not have ownership because

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600
ownership or not have ownership because

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.950
ownership or not have ownership because uh based on this we'll just have

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960
uh based on this we'll just have

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.990
uh based on this we'll just have different levels in here. Uh how to make

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000
different levels in here. Uh how to make

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.950
different levels in here. Uh how to make this entity even to appear here. Okay.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960
this entity even to appear here. Okay.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.950
this entity even to appear here. Okay. So if you want to turn on uh the ACL for

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960
So if you want to turn on uh the ACL for

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.350
So if you want to turn on uh the ACL for our entity, you need to do

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360
our entity, you need to do

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.789
our entity, you need to do enable uh permissions for this entity.

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799
enable uh permissions for this entity.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:31.590
enable uh permissions for this entity. Uh you need to uh add security scope

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600
Uh you need to uh add security scope

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.150
Uh you need to uh add security scope inside entity configuration. So again we

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160
inside entity configuration. So again we

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.870
inside entity configuration. So again we need to go back to our entity and in the

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880
need to go back to our entity and in the

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.909
need to go back to our entity and in the add config section uh we need to specify

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919
add config section uh we need to specify

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.789
add config section uh we need to specify security section.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799
security section.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:46.789
security section. Okay.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:49.750
You do not need you do not uh need to

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760
You do not need you do not uh need to

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.070
You do not need you do not uh need to have ownership for this. You can just

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080
have ownership for this. You can just

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.110
have ownership for this. You can just basically turn ACL

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120
basically turn ACL

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.150
basically turn ACL uh on. So security type ACL. We support

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160
uh on. So security type ACL. We support

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.830
uh on. So security type ACL. We support only this one. Uh then group name empty

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840
only this one. Uh then group name empty

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.549
only this one. Uh then group name empty means back office role. If I have here

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559
means back office role. If I have here

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:08.549
means back office role. If I have here commerce this then this entity will have

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559
commerce this then this entity will have

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:11.350
commerce this then this entity will have turned on security uh for the storefront

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360
turned on security uh for the storefront

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.750
turned on security uh for the storefront roles. So customer user roles. So empty

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760
roles. So customer user roles. So empty

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.070
roles. So customer user roles. So empty always means back office, commerce means

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080
always means back office, commerce means

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.110
always means back office, commerce means storefront and then this category here

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120
storefront and then this category here

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.750
storefront and then this category here is just for the UI there some additional

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760
is just for the UI there some additional

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.830
is just for the UI there some additional parameter that can that is uh used later

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840
parameter that can that is uh used later

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.390
parameter that can that is uh used later to display this particular entity

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400
to display this particular entity

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.310
to display this particular entity because as you can see here on this list

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320
because as you can see here on this list

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.870
because as you can see here on this list we have a lot of entities

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880
we have a lot of entities

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.669
we have a lot of entities seriously a lot of

00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679
seriously a lot of

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:38.070
seriously a lot of that's why we have also those tabs. So

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080
that's why we have also those tabs. So

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.669
that's why we have also those tabs. So for example, if you want to put this

00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679
for example, if you want to put this

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.150
for example, if you want to put this entity here we have all but here we have

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160
entity here we have all but here we have

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.669
entity here we have all but here we have some only some. So if you want to put

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679
some only some. So if you want to put

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:49.110
some only some. So if you want to put this entity inside this tab you need to

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120
this entity inside this tab you need to

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.350
this entity inside this tab you need to specify category account management. So

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360
specify category account management. So

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.310
specify category account management. So this is basically only only for the UI.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320
this is basically only only for the UI.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.190
this is basically only only for the UI. Uh after you add this section uh do not

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200
Uh after you add this section uh do not

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.669
Uh after you add this section uh do not forget to execute this command to uh to

00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679
forget to execute this command to uh to

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.549
forget to execute this command to uh to update entity config and actually in

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559
update entity config and actually in

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.470
update entity config and actually in this particular case you're good to go.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480
this particular case you're good to go.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.549
this particular case you're good to go. So for the ownership you also need to

00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559
So for the ownership you also need to

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.710
So for the ownership you also need to create columns with migrations but for

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720
create columns with migrations but for

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.110
create columns with migrations but for the ACL all you need to do is basically

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120
the ACL all you need to do is basically

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.950
the ACL all you need to do is basically say that you want to turn on this

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960
say that you want to turn on this

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.990
say that you want to turn on this functionality for for your entity. Once

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000
functionality for for your entity. Once

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.110
functionality for for your entity. Once you do this your entity will appear on

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120
you do this your entity will appear on

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:28.710
you do this your entity will appear on this long list here. Okay. So

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.270
I don't have my usernaming type that we

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280
I don't have my usernaming type that we

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.909
I don't have my usernaming type that we created here yet. we're going to do it

00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919
created here yet. we're going to do it

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:36.310
created here yet. we're going to do it uh in the practice. We will enable the

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320
uh in the practice. We will enable the

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.470
uh in the practice. We will enable the ACL for our usernaming type. So

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480
ACL for our usernaming type. So

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.430
ACL for our usernaming type. So basically add this section, execute this

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440
basically add this section, execute this

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.990
basically add this section, execute this command and our entity will appear here

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000
command and our entity will appear here

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.830
command and our entity will appear here on the list and we'll be able to set

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840
on the list and we'll be able to set

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.230
on the list and we'll be able to set uh permissions for view create edit and

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240
uh permissions for view create edit and

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.990
uh permissions for view create edit and so on.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.669
Okay.

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679
Okay.

00:20:55.679 --> 00:21:01.350
Okay. Um

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.789
so how how those permissions will

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799
so how how those permissions will

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:08.390
so how how those permissions will actually edit. As you can see here, we

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400
actually edit. As you can see here, we

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.789
actually edit. As you can see here, we have view, create, edit, delete. But

00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799
have view, create, edit, delete. But

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:14.390
have view, create, edit, delete. But sometimes we can have something else.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400
sometimes we can have something else.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.029
sometimes we can have something else. And let's say

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039
And let's say

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:20.230
And let's say for the price list, we have additional

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240
for the price list, we have additional

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.350
for the price list, we have additional recalculate action here. And how to

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360
recalculate action here. And how to

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.110
recalculate action here. And how to create this action? In case you need

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120
create this action? In case you need

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.750
create this action? In case you need something else, uh you need to do it

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760
something else, uh you need to do it

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.750
something else, uh you need to do it inside the permissions yam file. This is

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760
inside the permissions yam file. This is

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.830
inside the permissions yam file. This is inside resources config or so. So it

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840
inside resources config or so. So it

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.669
inside resources config or so. So it will be autoloaded for you by our

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679
will be autoloaded for you by our

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:42.549
will be autoloaded for you by our security bundle and

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:46.630
this is from price list

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640
this is from price list

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.510
this is from price list pricing bundle. Okay. So here inside

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520
pricing bundle. Okay. So here inside

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.990
pricing bundle. Okay. So here inside this file we have oral permissions name

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000
this file we have oral permissions name

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.190
this file we have oral permissions name space and then you specify each action.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200
space and then you specify each action.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.990
space and then you specify each action. So we specify calculate action. This is

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000
So we specify calculate action. This is

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.830
So we specify calculate action. This is the name of action and also identifier

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840
the name of action and also identifier

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.909
the name of action and also identifier and it needs to be displayed in the back

00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919
and it needs to be displayed in the back

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:07.510
and it needs to be displayed in the back office. So we need a label.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520
office. So we need a label.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.750
office. So we need a label. It's recalculate which is

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760
It's recalculate which is

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.110
It's recalculate which is true. It's like recalculate. Then what

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120
true. It's like recalculate. Then what

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.549
true. It's like recalculate. Then what we can specify is uh group names. So

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559
we can specify is uh group names. So

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:21.909
we can specify is uh group names. So again uh empty will go to back office

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919
again uh empty will go to back office

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:24.070
again uh empty will go to back office role. Commerce will go to store uh

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
role. Commerce will go to store uh

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.510
role. Commerce will go to store uh storefront role. uh if we want to apply

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520
storefront role. uh if we want to apply

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.950
storefront role. uh if we want to apply this action to all entities and here you

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960
this action to all entities and here you

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.110
this action to all entities and here you have false that's why this action it's

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120
have false that's why this action it's

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.909
have false that's why this action it's not available on all entities but only

00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919
not available on all entities but only

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:38.230
not available on all entities but only on some particular actually only one on

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240
on some particular actually only one on

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.310
on some particular actually only one on the price list

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320
the price list

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.029
the price list um entity and that's why we have this

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039
um entity and that's why we have this

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:46.310
um entity and that's why we have this recalculate here. So if you need any

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320
recalculate here. So if you need any

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.350
recalculate here. So if you need any like any more actions then you can

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360
like any more actions then you can

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.350
like any more actions then you can create permissions y file and add some

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360
create permissions y file and add some

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.430
create permissions y file and add some action specify if it should be for all

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440
action specify if it should be for all

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.070
action specify if it should be for all the entities or only for some specific

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080
the entities or only for some specific

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.510
the entities or only for some specific entities. Okay.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520
entities. Okay.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.270
entities. Okay. Uh

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.510
just as a reminder what kind of access

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520
just as a reminder what kind of access

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.590
just as a reminder what kind of access levels we have um if we have ownership

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600
levels we have um if we have ownership

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.310
levels we have um if we have ownership and uh the most important part how to

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320
and uh the most important part how to

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.630
and uh the most important part how to actually use this. Okay. So we have a

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640
actually use this. Okay. So we have a

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.230
actually use this. Okay. So we have a role we can set for example that I can

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240
role we can set for example that I can

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.669
role we can set for example that I can uh see or cannot see contact price list

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679
uh see or cannot see contact price list

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:27.190
uh see or cannot see contact price list or whatever. How to actually now use it?

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200
or whatever. How to actually now use it?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.750
or whatever. How to actually now use it? Uh so uh we need to create permission

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760
Uh so uh we need to create permission

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.950
Uh so uh we need to create permission rules. For example, rule will tell me if

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960
rules. For example, rule will tell me if

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.830
rules. For example, rule will tell me if I have access to view contact entities

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840
I have access to view contact entities

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.310
I have access to view contact entities and how to create those rules. You can

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320
and how to create those rules. You can

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.870
and how to create those rules. You can do it inside controller and inside uh

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880
do it inside controller and inside uh

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.909
do it inside controller and inside uh yan file. If you do it inside yan file

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919
yan file. If you do it inside yan file

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.990
yan file. If you do it inside yan file then you will just create a definition

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000
then you will just create a definition

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.470
then you will just create a definition and later you will need to use those

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480
and later you will need to use those

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.190
and later you will need to use those defined rules in the controller. you can

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200
defined rules in the controller. you can

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.390
defined rules in the controller. you can actually create and already use

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400
actually create and already use

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.669
actually create and already use and we do it via the annotation.

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.789
Okay. Okay. And we have this annotation

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799
Okay. Okay. And we have this annotation

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:07.110
Okay. Okay. And we have this annotation called ACL

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120
called ACL

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.590
called ACL that is from

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600
that is from

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:17.190
that is from our security bundle.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.149
Okay. And um inside here what we are

00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159
Okay. And um inside here what we are

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.710
Okay. And um inside here what we are doing we are using this annotation means

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720
doing we are using this annotation means

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.669
doing we are using this annotation means that we are creating this rule and we'll

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679
that we are creating this rule and we'll

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:28.549
that we are creating this rule and we'll also already using it on top of our

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559
also already using it on top of our

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:31.190
also already using it on top of our controller action. So right now my view

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200
controller action. So right now my view

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.190
controller action. So right now my view action is protected with this rule. Uh

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200
action is protected with this rule. Uh

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.110
action is protected with this rule. Uh each rule needs to have an identifier

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120
each rule needs to have an identifier

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.390
each rule needs to have an identifier because you can later use this rule in

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400
because you can later use this rule in

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.149
because you can later use this rule in many other places by its identifier.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159
many other places by its identifier.

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:46.470
many other places by its identifier. Then you need to specify the type. So it

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480
Then you need to specify the type. So it

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.269
Then you need to specify the type. So it can be either entity or action. So you

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279
can be either entity or action. So you

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.909
can be either entity or action. So you remember that we have this entity uh

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919
remember that we have this entity uh

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:54.870
remember that we have this entity uh permissions and we have action

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880
permissions and we have action

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.710
permissions and we have action permissions. Okay. So now we're

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720
permissions. Okay. So now we're

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.909
permissions. Okay. So now we're specifying that it's entity permission

00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919
specifying that it's entity permission

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:02.470
specifying that it's entity permission and we need to specify what entity and

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480
and we need to specify what entity and

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.190
and we need to specify what entity and which action. Uh so basically here we

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200
which action. Uh so basically here we

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.350
which action. Uh so basically here we are checking if logged in user has a

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360
are checking if logged in user has a

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.230
are checking if logged in user has a view access to user entity and we named

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240
view access to user entity and we named

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.789
view access to user entity and we named this rule or user user view. You will

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799
this rule or user user view. You will

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.029
this rule or user user view. You will see in our vendor files that we also

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039
see in our vendor files that we also

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:23.430
see in our vendor files that we also name those rules so that this ID can

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440
name those rules so that this ID can

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.269
name those rules so that this ID can tell me exactly what's going on because

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279
tell me exactly what's going on because

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:27.590
tell me exactly what's going on because later on you will use this only by

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600
later on you will use this only by

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.710
later on you will use this only by identifier. So it's good to put here a

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720
identifier. So it's good to put here a

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.510
identifier. So it's good to put here a good name because it will be helpful in

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520
good name because it will be helpful in

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.470
good name because it will be helpful in the future. Uh so you will see that we

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480
the future. Uh so you will see that we

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.549
the future. Uh so you will see that we always have like oruro user it's my

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559
always have like oruro user it's my

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:42.230
always have like oruro user it's my bundle then user entity and uh view

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240
bundle then user entity and uh view

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.830
bundle then user entity and uh view action for the

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.470
create we will have oral user user

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480
create we will have oral user user

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.630
create we will have oral user user creates. So just by the name of the rule

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640
creates. So just by the name of the rule

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.350
creates. So just by the name of the rule I can assure you that and this is

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360
I can assure you that and this is

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.909
I can assure you that and this is checking if I have create uh permission

00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919
checking if I have create uh permission

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:02.789
checking if I have create uh permission for the user entity. Okay. So it's also

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799
for the user entity. Okay. So it's also

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:06.630
for the user entity. Okay. So it's also good thing to for those identifiers to

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640
good thing to for those identifiers to

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.110
good thing to for those identifiers to be to mean something for you.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120
be to mean something for you.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.350
be to mean something for you. Uh then if you'd like to use some

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360
Uh then if you'd like to use some

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.390
Uh then if you'd like to use some existing rule here in your controller

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400
existing rule here in your controller

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.430
existing rule here in your controller for this we have second annotation. So

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440
for this we have second annotation. So

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.909
for this we have second annotation. So normally we protect with a view action

00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919
normally we protect with a view action

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:24.310
normally we protect with a view action with a view permission we protect two

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320
with a view permission we protect two

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.269
with a view permission we protect two actions uh view page which is kind of

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279
actions uh view page which is kind of

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:29.590
actions uh view page which is kind of obvious but also index page right

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600
obvious but also index page right

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.350
obvious but also index page right because on index page we have a list of

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360
because on index page we have a list of

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.909
because on index page we have a list of our entities so if I don't have access

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919
our entities so if I don't have access

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:36.950
our entities so if I don't have access to view this entity I should not be able

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960
to view this entity I should not be able

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.310
to view this entity I should not be able to to see the list of it that's why we

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320
to to see the list of it that's why we

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.950
to to see the list of it that's why we also protect um index action with this u

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960
also protect um index action with this u

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.470
also protect um index action with this u ACL

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480
ACL

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.590
ACL and to do this we have

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.990
uh just separate annotation. It's called

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000
uh just separate annotation. It's called

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.350
uh just separate annotation. It's called ACL ancestor and this just means use

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360
ACL ancestor and this just means use

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.909
ACL ancestor and this just means use existing rule and here you need to pass

00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919
existing rule and here you need to pass

00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:03.750
existing rule and here you need to pass this rule ID. So this is just using this

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760
this rule ID. So this is just using this

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.549
this rule ID. So this is just using this rule and protecting our action with this

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559
rule and protecting our action with this

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:10.870
rule and protecting our action with this rule with the ACL you are both creating

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880
rule with the ACL you are both creating

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.350
rule with the ACL you are both creating and using. Okay, so that's the only

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360
and using. Okay, so that's the only

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.070
and using. Okay, so that's the only difference.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080
difference.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.190
difference. Uh then how to do the same from the

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200
Uh then how to do the same from the

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.789
Uh then how to do the same from the ACL's uh you need to create ACL in

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799
ACL's uh you need to create ACL in

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.029
ACL's uh you need to create ACL in resources config oro this file it's

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039
resources config oro this file it's

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.669
resources config oro this file it's inside or subd directory so it will be

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679
inside or subd directory so it will be

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.070
inside or subd directory so it will be autoloaded for you

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080
autoloaded for you

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.630
autoloaded for you uh and here in the ACL name space you

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640
uh and here in the ACL name space you

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.789
uh and here in the ACL name space you specify those

00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799
specify those

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:38.310
specify those rules and this is only a definition now

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320
rules and this is only a definition now

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.950
rules and this is only a definition now if you want to use it you need to take

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960
if you want to use it you need to take

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.510
if you want to use it you need to take the ID because this is the ID in this

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520
the ID because this is the ID in this

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.990
the ID because this is the ID in this format and for example go go to your

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000
format and for example go go to your

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.990
format and for example go go to your controller, use uh ACL ancestor and put

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000
controller, use uh ACL ancestor and put

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.990
controller, use uh ACL ancestor and put this rule ID here. Okay, so here we are

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000
this rule ID here. Okay, so here we are

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.230
this rule ID here. Okay, so here we are only creating rules not using them

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240
only creating rules not using them

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.470
only creating rules not using them anywhere yet.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480
anywhere yet.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.950
anywhere yet. Um type entity class permission group

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960
Um type entity class permission group

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.870
Um type entity class permission group name. So this is be office commerce mean

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880
name. So this is be office commerce mean

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.990
name. So this is be office commerce mean storefront. So exactly the same that uh

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000
storefront. So exactly the same that uh

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.510
storefront. So exactly the same that uh we have here. One additional uh very

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520
we have here. One additional uh very

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.870
we have here. One additional uh very nice element here are those bindings. So

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880
nice element here are those bindings. So

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.350
nice element here are those bindings. So imagine the situation that we have a

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360
imagine the situation that we have a

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.230
imagine the situation that we have a controller in vendors. So you cannot go

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240
controller in vendors. So you cannot go

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.430
controller in vendors. So you cannot go to this controller file and edit it and

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440
to this controller file and edit it and

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.870
to this controller file and edit it and protect uh this controller action with

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880
protect uh this controller action with

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.950
protect uh this controller action with uh or this action with some additional

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
uh or this action with some additional

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.590
uh or this action with some additional ACL. So what to do if you want to create

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600
ACL. So what to do if you want to create

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.669
ACL. So what to do if you want to create a new action new rule but protect with

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679
a new action new rule but protect with

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.230
a new action new rule but protect with this rule some action from the

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240
this rule some action from the

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.470
this rule some action from the controller in vendors.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480
controller in vendors.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.549
controller in vendors. Uh so this is why we have this binding

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559
Uh so this is why we have this binding

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:44.310
Uh so this is why we have this binding section for because here in those

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320
section for because here in those

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.510
section for because here in those bindings you can uh specify a list of co

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520
bindings you can uh specify a list of co

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.149
bindings you can uh specify a list of co controllers and actions that you want to

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159
controllers and actions that you want to

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:53.190
controllers and actions that you want to protect with this rule. Okay. So you

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200
protect with this rule. Okay. So you

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.470
protect with this rule. Okay. So you cannot edit uh controller from vendors

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480
cannot edit uh controller from vendors

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.789
cannot edit uh controller from vendors but you can specify it here and this way

00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799
but you can specify it here and this way

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:02.630
but you can specify it here and this way uh those actions will be additionally

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640
uh those actions will be additionally

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.909
uh those actions will be additionally protected with this particular rule. And

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919
protected with this particular rule. And

00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:09.350
protected with this particular rule. And how to add this bindings? I think we

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360
how to add this bindings? I think we

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.880
how to add this bindings? I think we have example for this.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:12.890
have example for this.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:18.070
have example for this. [Music]

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.950
Okay. So all you need to do is pass the

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960
Okay. So all you need to do is pass the

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.070
Okay. So all you need to do is pass the class. This is the path to my controller

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080
class. This is the path to my controller

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.470
class. This is the path to my controller and which action you want to protect

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480
and which action you want to protect

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.909
and which action you want to protect with this particular rule. Okay. So this

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919
with this particular rule. Okay. So this

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:31.909
with this particular rule. Okay. So this create action on this controller will be

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919
create action on this controller will be

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:33.830
create action on this controller will be additionally protected also with this

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840
additionally protected also with this

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:43.510
additionally protected also with this rule.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.669
Okay. And how to check those

00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679
Okay. And how to check those

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:48.230
Okay. And how to check those permissions? So if you use this in the

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240
permissions? So if you use this in the

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.750
permissions? So if you use this in the controller,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760
controller,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.630
controller, um this is already checking, right? So

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640
um this is already checking, right? So

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.789
um this is already checking, right? So either you add this inside controller,

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799
either you add this inside controller,

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:57.110
either you add this inside controller, you can use ACL or ACL ancestor

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120
you can use ACL or ACL ancestor

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.389
you can use ACL or ACL ancestor annotation and this will protect this

00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399
annotation and this will protect this

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:02.789
annotation and this will protect this action with it. But what to do if you

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799
action with it. But what to do if you

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.750
action with it. But what to do if you want to kind of manually check the

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760
want to kind of manually check the

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.950
want to kind of manually check the permissions? So in the PHP code for this

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960
permissions? So in the PHP code for this

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.430
permissions? So in the PHP code for this we have authorization uh checker

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440
we have authorization uh checker

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.310
we have authorization uh checker service. Uh so we can uh get it and then

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320
service. Uh so we can uh get it and then

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.350
service. Uh so we can uh get it and then this service has is granted method to

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360
this service has is granted method to

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.590
this service has is granted method to which you pass the action and entity and

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600
which you pass the action and entity and

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.870
which you pass the action and entity and it will return uh the you uh boolean

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880
it will return uh the you uh boolean

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.669
it will return uh the you uh boolean value if logged in user has view

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679
value if logged in user has view

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:30.230
value if logged in user has view permission to some particular entity.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240
permission to some particular entity.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.750
permission to some particular entity. Okay. Okay. And is granted it's

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760
Okay. Okay. And is granted it's

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.350
Okay. Okay. And is granted it's returning true or false. And then uh you

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360
returning true or false. And then uh you

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.110
returning true or false. And then uh you can also use uh ACL rules in YAML files.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120
can also use uh ACL rules in YAML files.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.990
can also use uh ACL rules in YAML files. You already saw that uh in multiple

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000
You already saw that uh in multiple

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.110
You already saw that uh in multiple places. For example, in data grids you

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120
places. For example, in data grids you

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.750
places. For example, in data grids you can specify ACL resource and put here

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760
can specify ACL resource and put here

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.430
can specify ACL resource and put here this rule ID. Rule ID which means this

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440
this rule ID. Rule ID which means this

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.990
this rule ID. Rule ID which means this rule ID.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000
rule ID.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.350
rule ID. This is rule ID. Okay.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360
This is rule ID. Okay.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.590
This is rule ID. Okay. uh and you can with this protect for

00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600
uh and you can with this protect for

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.070
uh and you can with this protect for example the whole data grid so let's say

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080
example the whole data grid so let's say

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.389
example the whole data grid so let's say that I won't see data grid if I don't

00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399
that I won't see data grid if I don't

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:07.190
that I won't see data grid if I don't have access to something or you can also

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200
have access to something or you can also

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.029
have access to something or you can also protect single actions so uh you can

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039
protect single actions so uh you can

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:14.710
protect single actions so uh you can display data grid but for example hide

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720
display data grid but for example hide

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.389
display data grid but for example hide uh create button or something like that

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399
uh create button or something like that

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:21.029
uh create button or something like that or some additional button uh sending

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039
or some additional button uh sending

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:24.789
or some additional button uh sending emails whatever so in y files we do it

00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799
emails whatever so in y files we do it

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.190
emails whatever so in y files we do it with ACL resource

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200
with ACL resource

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.430
with ACL resource Um sorry. Then uh in the tweak template

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440
Um sorry. Then uh in the tweak template

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.870
Um sorry. Then uh in the tweak template we created a tweak extension with this

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880
we created a tweak extension with this

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.310
we created a tweak extension with this method is granted for you to which you

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320
method is granted for you to which you

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.909
method is granted for you to which you just pass permission name and entity and

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919
just pass permission name and entity and

00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:45.029
just pass permission name and entity and it will return you true false based on

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039
it will return you true false based on

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.509
it will return you true false based on the fact if logged in user has few

00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519
the fact if logged in user has few

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:50.070
the fact if logged in user has few access to some particular entity. Okay.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080
access to some particular entity. Okay.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.190
access to some particular entity. Okay. So this is how you do it from uh tweak,

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200
So this is how you do it from uh tweak,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.430
So this is how you do it from uh tweak, yaml or php code.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.389
Uh okay. So let's now uh do some

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399
Uh okay. So let's now uh do some

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:03.990
Uh okay. So let's now uh do some example.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000
example.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.389
example. So let's imagine that we have a call

00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399
So let's imagine that we have a call

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:10.710
So let's imagine that we have a call center and this call center will create

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720
center and this call center will create

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.950
center and this call center will create uh contacts.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960
uh contacts.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.149
uh contacts. We have operators that will call to some

00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159
We have operators that will call to some

00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:19.830
We have operators that will call to some people and create contacts. Okay. Then

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840
people and create contacts. Okay. Then

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.310
people and create contacts. Okay. Then uh operator A and uh A1 and A2 they have

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320
uh operator A and uh A1 and A2 they have

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.630
uh operator A and uh A1 and A2 they have their manager because this is department

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640
their manager because this is department

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.630
their manager because this is department A. Then uh operator B1 B2 they have

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640
A. Then uh operator B1 B2 they have

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.389
A. Then uh operator B1 B2 they have their manager. Uh C1 C2 they have their

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399
their manager. Uh C1 C2 they have their

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:38.149
their manager. Uh C1 C2 they have their manager. Then managers have their own

00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159
manager. Then managers have their own

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.430
manager. Then managers have their own manager of call center. Uh then imagine

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440
manager of call center. Uh then imagine

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.990
manager of call center. Uh then imagine that the slide is not big enough. Um

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000
that the slide is not big enough. Um

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.990
that the slide is not big enough. Um but imagine that we have another call

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000
but imagine that we have another call

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.149
but imagine that we have another call center here

00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159
center here

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.870
center here and another manager of organization.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880
and another manager of organization.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.110
and another manager of organization. Also we could have uh multiple

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120
Also we could have uh multiple

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.190
Also we could have uh multiple organizations here. You need to imagine

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200
organizations here. You need to imagine

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.149
organizations here. You need to imagine that because the slide is really very

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159
that because the slide is really very

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:04.630
that because the slide is really very not wide enough for me to show you this

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640
not wide enough for me to show you this

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.549
not wide enough for me to show you this but I think you get the idea right. We

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559
but I think you get the idea right. We

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:09.110
but I think you get the idea right. We have this tree with levels and we can

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120
have this tree with levels and we can

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.870
have this tree with levels and we can have multiple levels uh everywhere.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880
have multiple levels uh everywhere.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.230
have multiple levels uh everywhere. Uh and what we want to actually do we uh

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240
Uh and what we want to actually do we uh

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.230
Uh and what we want to actually do we uh need to create this contact entity and

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240
need to create this contact entity and

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.950
need to create this contact entity and uh we need to create it this way that

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960
uh we need to create it this way that

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.590
uh we need to create it this way that later we will be able to show operator A

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600
later we will be able to show operator A

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.870
later we will be able to show operator A only contacts that he created. Then

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880
only contacts that he created. Then

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.950
only contacts that he created. Then manager of department should see all the

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960
manager of department should see all the

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.509
manager of department should see all the contacts created by operator A1 and A2.

00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519
contacts created by operator A1 and A2.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.509
contacts created by operator A1 and A2. Manager of call center should be able to

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519
Manager of call center should be able to

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:43.830
Manager of call center should be able to see contacts from all uh departments.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840
see contacts from all uh departments.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.389
see contacts from all uh departments. Manager of organization from the whole

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399
Manager of organization from the whole

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.549
Manager of organization from the whole organization and administrator basically

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559
organization and administrator basically

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.070
organization and administrator basically everything disregarding the

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080
everything disregarding the

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.830
everything disregarding the organizations.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840
organizations.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.630
organizations. Uh so now when you will be creating this

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640
Uh so now when you will be creating this

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.149
Uh so now when you will be creating this entity the question is uh what kind of

00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159
entity the question is uh what kind of

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:02.230
entity the question is uh what kind of ownership we need to give this entity so

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240
ownership we need to give this entity so

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.029
ownership we need to give this entity so later you'll be able to filter the list

00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039
later you'll be able to filter the list

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:10.629
later you'll be able to filter the list by those by all those levels. Okay. So

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639
by those by all those levels. Okay. So

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.629
by those by all those levels. Okay. So question is

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639
question is

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.790
question is we need to create the ownership on our

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800
we need to create the ownership on our

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.270
we need to create the ownership on our entity the way that operators will be

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280
entity the way that operators will be

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.230
entity the way that operators will be able to see only contacts assigned

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240
able to see only contacts assigned

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.270
able to see only contacts assigned created uh by them

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280
created uh by them

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.389
created uh by them and basically in this particular case uh

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399
and basically in this particular case uh

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:29.829
and basically in this particular case uh the answer is um

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839
the answer is um

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:32.550
the answer is um user right so we need to create an

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560
user right so we need to create an

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.030
user right so we need to create an ownership on our entity and set

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040
ownership on our entity and set

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.629
ownership on our entity and set ownership to user because we need to

00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639
ownership to user because we need to

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.669
ownership to user because we need to save information which user created this

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679
save information which user created this

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.030
save information which user created this entity. So later on we will be able to

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040
entity. So later on we will be able to

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.950
entity. So later on we will be able to show operators only their contacts

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960
show operators only their contacts

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.589
show operators only their contacts and for our operator we will create a

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599
and for our operator we will create a

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:54.790
and for our operator we will create a role operator role and on this operator

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800
role operator role and on this operator

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.230
role operator role and on this operator role we will set a view permission to

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240
role we will set a view permission to

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.109
role we will set a view permission to user level for our uh contact entity.

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119
user level for our uh contact entity.

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.589
user level for our uh contact entity. Then my manager of department should see

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599
Then my manager of department should see

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:08.069
Then my manager of department should see contacts assigned to all the operators

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079
contacts assigned to all the operators

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:11.670
contacts assigned to all the operators in the department. Okay. So to all this.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680
in the department. Okay. So to all this.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.230
in the department. Okay. So to all this. So this manager of department cannot

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240
So this manager of department cannot

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.630
So this manager of department cannot have operator role because that's not

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640
have operator role because that's not

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.430
have operator role because that's not enough. Uh we need to create separate

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440
enough. Uh we need to create separate

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.310
enough. Uh we need to create separate role for this guy for those guys

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320
role for this guy for those guys

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.829
role for this guy for those guys actually. And this role needs to have

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839
actually. And this role needs to have

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:29.190
actually. And this role needs to have different access level on the contact

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200
different access level on the contact

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.750
different access level on the contact entity. And this access level

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760
entity. And this access level

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.230
entity. And this access level is business unit.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240
is business unit.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.950
is business unit. So he'll be manager of department will

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960
So he'll be manager of department will

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.230
So he'll be manager of department will be able to see all the contact of his

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240
be able to see all the contact of his

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.390
be able to see all the contact of his operators.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400
operators.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.790
operators. Uh then manager of consultter needs to

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800
Uh then manager of consultter needs to

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.109
Uh then manager of consultter needs to see all the contacts from those

00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119
see all the contacts from those

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:52.710
see all the contacts from those departments.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720
departments.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.950
departments. So for him we also need to create

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960
So for him we also need to create

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.470
So for him we also need to create separate role and for this third role we

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480
separate role and for this third role we

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.470
separate role and for this third role we will set different level for the contact

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480
will set different level for the contact

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.190
will set different level for the contact view action and for

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200
view action and for

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.430
view action and for manager of call center this is division.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440
manager of call center this is division.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.670
manager of call center this is division. Division means business unit and child

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680
Division means business unit and child

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.829
Division means business unit and child business units.

00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839
business units.

00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:16.310
business units. Uh going further organiz manager of

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320
Uh going further organiz manager of

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.030
Uh going further organiz manager of organization uh must see all contacts in

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040
organization uh must see all contacts in

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.950
organization uh must see all contacts in the organization. So again here we will

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960
the organization. So again here we will

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.790
the organization. So again here we will need to create separate role and uh set

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800
need to create separate role and uh set

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.310
need to create separate role and uh set yet different level for the view action

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320
yet different level for the view action

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.950
yet different level for the view action on our contact entity and this will be

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960
on our contact entity and this will be

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.829
on our contact entity and this will be organization level and finally our

00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839
organization level and finally our

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:36.870
organization level and finally our administrator will have global level. So

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880
administrator will have global level. So

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.349
administrator will have global level. So uh administrator will be able to see

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359
uh administrator will be able to see

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:42.150
uh administrator will be able to see basically everything

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160
basically everything

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.870
basically everything and at the end you will end up with this

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880
and at the end you will end up with this

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.230
and at the end you will end up with this structure in Aro. So this will be some

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240
structure in Aro. So this will be some

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.829
structure in Aro. So this will be some organization.

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839
organization.

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.510
organization. Those

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520
Those

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.630
Those are all business units but this is the

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640
are all business units but this is the

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.190
are all business units but this is the parent one

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200
parent one

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.310
parent one and it has child business units inside.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320
and it has child business units inside.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.550
and it has child business units inside. Okay. So when you create this structure

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560
Okay. So when you create this structure

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.270
Okay. So when you create this structure and uh then you can create different set

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280
and uh then you can create different set

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.589
and uh then you can create different set of roles. So you'll have separate roles

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599
of roles. So you'll have separate roles

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.670
of roles. So you'll have separate roles for operator, manager of department,

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680
for operator, manager of department,

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.069
for operator, manager of department, manager of call center and so on. And

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079
manager of call center and so on. And

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.790
manager of call center and so on. And you'll be able to set appropriate levels

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800
you'll be able to set appropriate levels

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.470
you'll be able to set appropriate levels on all those roles. So those users will

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480
on all those roles. So those users will

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.589
on all those roles. So those users will see different set of contacts on the

00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599
see different set of contacts on the

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:26.310
see different set of contacts on the contact list.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320
contact list.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.190
contact list. So that's the whole idea.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200
So that's the whole idea.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.710
So that's the whole idea. Uh it's uh pretty configurable and you

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720
Uh it's uh pretty configurable and you

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.950
Uh it's uh pretty configurable and you can do a lot of things from here from

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960
can do a lot of things from here from

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.630
can do a lot of things from here from the ACL.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640
the ACL.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.790
the ACL. Uh so whenever you want to show hide

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800
Uh so whenever you want to show hide

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.870
Uh so whenever you want to show hide something check if you can do it with

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880
something check if you can do it with

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.630
something check if you can do it with ACL because maybe you can just create

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640
ACL because maybe you can just create

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.230
ACL because maybe you can just create separate roles set different set of

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240
separate roles set different set of

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.430
separate roles set different set of permissions and you'll be good to go. Uh

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440
permissions and you'll be good to go. Uh

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.349
permissions and you'll be good to go. Uh so remember about this this

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359
so remember about this this

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.990
so remember about this this configuration

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000
configuration

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.589
configuration and yep that's it.

00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599
and yep that's it.

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:01.270
and yep that's it. Uh and what about the second part of uh

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280
Uh and what about the second part of uh

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.230
Uh and what about the second part of uh our permissions? Uh so action

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240
our permissions? Uh so action

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.790
our permissions? Uh so action permissions this is not not connected to

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800
permissions this is not not connected to

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.790
permissions this is not not connected to any entity or anything. This is

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800
any entity or anything. This is

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.670
any entity or anything. This is basically just on off value if you want

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680
basically just on off value if you want

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.150
basically just on off value if you want to allow user with particular role to do

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160
to allow user with particular role to do

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.510
to allow user with particular role to do something or uh restrict from doing

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520
something or uh restrict from doing

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.310
something or uh restrict from doing something. So we don't have any access

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320
something. So we don't have any access

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.550
something. So we don't have any access levels here. This is not connected to

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560
levels here. This is not connected to

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.069
levels here. This is not connected to ownership because this is not connected

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079
ownership because this is not connected

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:26.150
ownership because this is not connected to any entity.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160
to any entity.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.510
to any entity. We don't have different set of

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520
We don't have different set of

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.349
We don't have different set of permissions anything. That's basically

00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359
permissions anything. That's basically

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:32.310
permissions anything. That's basically binary value on off

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320
binary value on off

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.150
binary value on off and it's here. Okay. So on edit page we

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160
and it's here. Okay. So on edit page we

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.030
and it's here. Okay. So on edit page we have checks. This is represented as a

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040
have checks. This is represented as a

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.870
have checks. This is represented as a checkbox. And on the

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880
checkbox. And on the

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.750
checkbox. And on the uh view page this is basically

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.230
let's say this one.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240
let's say this one.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.430
let's say this one. If it's turned on then it's black. If

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440
If it's turned on then it's black. If

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.470
If it's turned on then it's black. If it's off then it's gray.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.990
And on edit we have checkbooks.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.510
Okay.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.550
Uh how to define uh action permissions

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560
Uh how to define uh action permissions

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.109
Uh how to define uh action permissions exactly the same way

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119
exactly the same way

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:15.109
exactly the same way uh either in the controller in

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119
uh either in the controller in

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:19.109
uh either in the controller in annotation or in the ACL YAML file. The

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119
annotation or in the ACL YAML file. The

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:23.589
annotation or in the ACL YAML file. The difference is that uh type is action and

00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599
difference is that uh type is action and

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.069
difference is that uh type is action and we don't have this uh class or

00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079
we don't have this uh class or

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:27.910
we don't have this uh class or permission because this is not connected

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920
permission because this is not connected

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.670
permission because this is not connected to any class uh or any permission. So we

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680
to any class uh or any permission. So we

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.630
to any class uh or any permission. So we have type you need to give it some label

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640
have type you need to give it some label

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.950
have type you need to give it some label because with this label we display it

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960
because with this label we display it

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.710
because with this label we display it here this label

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720
here this label

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.349
here this label uh and then group name this means back

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359
uh and then group name this means back

00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:45.750
uh and then group name this means back office commerce means storefront and the

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760
office commerce means storefront and the

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.430
office commerce means storefront and the same category uh

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440
same category uh

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.349
same category uh so you want to put it in some

00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359
so you want to put it in some

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:56.630
so you want to put it in some appropriate place in the UI.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.990
Okay.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.430
uh and second part is inside ACL yaml

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440
uh and second part is inside ACL yaml

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:09.589
uh and second part is inside ACL yaml file. So here this is the rule ID and we

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599
file. So here this is the rule ID and we

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:13.349
file. So here this is the rule ID and we will use this ID to use this rule uh

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359
will use this ID to use this rule uh

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:15.270
will use this ID to use this rule uh label

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280
label

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.030
label you can pass description you don't need

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040
you can pass description you don't need

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.829
you can pass description you don't need to type needs to be action and again

00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839
to type needs to be action and again

00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:21.589
to type needs to be action and again this goes to the back office commerce to

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599
this goes to the back office commerce to

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:24.790
this goes to the back office commerce to storefront category it's only for uh

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800
storefront category it's only for uh

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.710
storefront category it's only for uh displaying it in the UI

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720
displaying it in the UI

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.030
displaying it in the UI uh and how to use it how to check uh

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040
uh and how to use it how to check uh

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.349
uh and how to use it how to check uh exactly the same Okay. So uh in PHP with

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359
exactly the same Okay. So uh in PHP with

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:38.870
exactly the same Okay. So uh in PHP with authorization checker the only

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880
authorization checker the only

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.430
authorization checker the only difference that to is granted method you

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440
difference that to is granted method you

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.950
difference that to is granted method you need to pass the only the identifier of

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960
need to pass the only the identifier of

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.990
need to pass the only the identifier of your rule. Okay. So no entity no action

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000
your rule. Okay. So no entity no action

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.430
your rule. Okay. So no entity no action anything like this because it's not

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440
anything like this because it's not

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.990
anything like this because it's not relevant in this uh

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000
relevant in this uh

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.990
relevant in this uh particular case. So just basically you

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000
particular case. So just basically you

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.270
particular case. So just basically you always go with the rule identifier ICL

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280
always go with the rule identifier ICL

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.990
always go with the rule identifier ICL resource rule identifier and in tweak

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000
resource rule identifier and in tweak

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.630
resource rule identifier and in tweak template is granted method with rule

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640
template is granted method with rule

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.910
template is granted method with rule identifier.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.829
Uh and regarding storefront ownership um

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839
Uh and regarding storefront ownership um

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:12.470
Uh and regarding storefront ownership um this is exactly the same. The idea is

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480
this is exactly the same. The idea is

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.470
this is exactly the same. The idea is exactly the same. We just have separate

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480
exactly the same. We just have separate

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.589
exactly the same. We just have separate entities. So separate config options for

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599
entities. So separate config options for

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:20.230
entities. So separate config options for storefront. We have customer users as

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240
storefront. We have customer users as

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.630
storefront. We have customer users as users and customer user roles as roles.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640
users and customer user roles as roles.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.990
users and customer user roles as roles. Inside they look the same. So we have

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000
Inside they look the same. So we have

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.790
Inside they look the same. So we have list of entities and we have list of

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800
list of entities and we have list of

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.390
list of entities and we have list of actions but we have different levels

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400
actions but we have different levels

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.630
actions but we have different levels based on different users right and

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640
based on different users right and

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.270
based on different users right and different owner. So for for storefront

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280
different owner. So for for storefront

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.030
different owner. So for for storefront we have customers and child customers

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040
we have customers and child customers

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.829
we have customers and child customers then customer user.

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839
then customer user.

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:48.710
then customer user. Uh that's why we're going to have only

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720
Uh that's why we're going to have only

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.910
Uh that's why we're going to have only three levels. Okay. So user,

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920
three levels. Okay. So user,

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.950
three levels. Okay. So user, my records, customer

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960
my records, customer

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.349
my records, customer record, my records and all customer

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359
record, my records and all customer

00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:59.750
record, my records and all customer users from my customer and division

00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760
users from my customer and division

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.150
users from my customer and division means a customer and child customers.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160
means a customer and child customers.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.589
means a customer and child customers. Um and in the entity configuration we

00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599
Um and in the entity configuration we

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:11.270
Um and in the entity configuration we have separate options for this. So again

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280
have separate options for this. So again

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.030
have separate options for this. So again in the ownership part but uh for back

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040
in the ownership part but uh for back

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.510
in the ownership part but uh for back office owner type this was this

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520
office owner type this was this

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.510
office owner type this was this configuration and here we have frontend

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520
configuration and here we have frontend

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.230
configuration and here we have frontend owner type with front end user or

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240
owner type with front end user or

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.750
owner type with front end user or customer.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760
customer.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.710
customer. So basically just different names of

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720
So basically just different names of

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.270
So basically just different names of options and again you need to specify

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280
options and again you need to specify

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.670
options and again you need to specify field name uh in the entity and column

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680
field name uh in the entity and column

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.270
field name uh in the entity and column name in the database.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280
name in the database.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.910
name in the database. Okay.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:46.230
Uh and um if you want to use uh those uh

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240
Uh and um if you want to use uh those uh

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.069
Uh and um if you want to use uh those uh you created in ACL file or in controller

00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079
you created in ACL file or in controller

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:52.150
you created in ACL file or in controller the same way as for back office just

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160
the same way as for back office just

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.030
the same way as for back office just group name is not empty but is commerce.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040
group name is not empty but is commerce.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.190
group name is not empty but is commerce. Okay. Uh and here the same way we have

00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200
Okay. Uh and here the same way we have

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.790
Okay. Uh and here the same way we have set of roles. uh those roles have some

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800
set of roles. uh those roles have some

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.630
set of roles. uh those roles have some some permissions set and then we assign

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640
some permissions set and then we assign

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.470
some permissions set and then we assign those roles to our customer users.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480
those roles to our customer users.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.550
those roles to our customer users. Okay. Uh here is one additional thing

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560
Okay. Uh here is one additional thing

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.030
Okay. Uh here is one additional thing because this goes to storefront. So we

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040
because this goes to storefront. So we

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.990
because this goes to storefront. So we um allow not logged in users to enter

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000
um allow not logged in users to enter

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.910
um allow not logged in users to enter the storefront. For back office this is

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920
the storefront. For back office this is

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.670
the storefront. For back office this is not true. You need to be always logged

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680
not true. You need to be always logged

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.910
not true. You need to be always logged in. But for storefront guests can

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920
in. But for storefront guests can

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.030
in. But for storefront guests can access. So there is this additional role

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040
access. So there is this additional role

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.990
access. So there is this additional role called nonauthenticated visitors. And

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000
called nonauthenticated visitors. And

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.309
called nonauthenticated visitors. And this is the role that all your guest

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319
this is the role that all your guest

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:41.190
this is the role that all your guest users will have. So application will

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200
users will have. So application will

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.589
users will have. So application will always assume that there if the guests

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599
always assume that there if the guests

00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:47.589
always assume that there if the guests enter your site uh it will be treated as

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599
enter your site uh it will be treated as

00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:50.710
enter your site uh it will be treated as uh with this role. So if you want to

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720
uh with this role. So if you want to

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.990
uh with this role. So if you want to give guests some access or restrict deny

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000
give guests some access or restrict deny

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.790
give guests some access or restrict deny access, you can do it with ACL for this

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800
access, you can do it with ACL for this

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.470
access, you can do it with ACL for this particular role. As you can see by

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480
particular role. As you can see by

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.069
particular role. As you can see by default they cannot do much dear guests.

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079
default they cannot do much dear guests.

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.230
default they cannot do much dear guests. So

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240
So

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.550
So that's actually how this should be.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560
that's actually how this should be.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.069
that's actually how this should be. Okay.

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079
Okay.

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:13.030
Okay. And uh some more elements. We'll talk

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040
And uh some more elements. We'll talk

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.630
And uh some more elements. We'll talk about workflows next week. But basically

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640
about workflows next week. But basically

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.829
about workflows next week. But basically workflow uh you can create some workflow

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839
workflow uh you can create some workflow

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:23.589
workflow uh you can create some workflow uh for entity and uh this workflow will

00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599
uh for entity and uh this workflow will

00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:26.230
uh for entity and uh this workflow will have transitions right. So we'll be able

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240
have transitions right. So we'll be able

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.030
have transitions right. So we'll be able to go from one step to the other and we

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040
to go from one step to the other and we

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.829
to go from one step to the other and we also have a workflow permissions

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839
also have a workflow permissions

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:36.230
also have a workflow permissions and I can show you here better. So you

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240
and I can show you here better. So you

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.230
and I can show you here better. So you can either set permission for the

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240
can either set permission for the

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.349
can either set permission for the workflow if I'm able to see it use it

00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359
workflow if I'm able to see it use it

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:47.589
workflow if I'm able to see it use it or not or you can only say that I cannot

00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599
or not or you can only say that I cannot

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.990
or not or you can only say that I cannot perform transitions. So it will go to

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000
perform transitions. So it will go to

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.309
perform transitions. So it will go to the workflow and to the transitions that

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319
the workflow and to the transitions that

00:44:52.319 --> 00:44:57.349
the workflow and to the transitions that leads us from step to step.

00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:00.630
And also we have field-based ACL. We are

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640
And also we have field-based ACL. We are

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.270
And also we have field-based ACL. We are not using it out of the box anywhere but

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280
not using it out of the box anywhere but

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.990
not using it out of the box anywhere but it's available and in case you need it,

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000
it's available and in case you need it,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.230
it's available and in case you need it, it's good to know that it's there. So

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240
it's good to know that it's there. So

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.870
it's good to know that it's there. So instead of specifying uh

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880
instead of specifying uh

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.670
instead of specifying uh um let me go

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680
um let me go

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:23.990
um let me go back to back office role.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.190
Uh okay

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200
Uh okay

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.750
Uh okay instead of let's take opportunity

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760
instead of let's take opportunity

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.470
instead of let's take opportunity instead of specifying uh if I have view

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480
instead of specifying uh if I have view

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.270
instead of specifying uh if I have view access to this whole entity I can do it

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280
access to this whole entity I can do it

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.550
access to this whole entity I can do it per field and to do this uh you need to

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560
per field and to do this uh you need to

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.870
per field and to do this uh you need to enable it it configur inside

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880
enable it it configur inside

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.190
enable it it configur inside configuration section of your entity. So

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200
configuration section of your entity. So

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.510
configuration section of your entity. So from the code you go to entity edit at

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520
from the code you go to entity edit at

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.950
from the code you go to entity edit at config section. Uh and you can also edit

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960
config section. Uh and you can also edit

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.630
config section. Uh and you can also edit it from here.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:04.069
Let's

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:07.190
addit opportunity entity. And here you

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200
addit opportunity entity. And here you

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.349
addit opportunity entity. And here you have the switch for field level ACL. If

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359
have the switch for field level ACL. If

00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:14.230
have the switch for field level ACL. If I turn it on

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240
I turn it on

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.589
I turn it on and save

00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599
and save

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:27.190
and save and refresh this page,

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.430
you will see now this plus here and I

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440
you will see now this plus here and I

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.670
you will see now this plus here and I can expand it and I can set uh

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680
can expand it and I can set uh

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.710
can expand it and I can set uh permissions per each field. So for the

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720
permissions per each field. So for the

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.710
permissions per each field. So for the opportunities this can be situation when

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720
opportunities this can be situation when

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.150
opportunities this can be situation when you have a some user and you want to

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160
you have a some user and you want to

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.950
you have a some user and you want to show him the list of opportunities but

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960
show him the list of opportunities but

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.190
show him the list of opportunities but you don't want to see the approximate

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200
you don't want to see the approximate

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.150
you don't want to see the approximate budget or anything because all money

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160
budget or anything because all money

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.950
budget or anything because all money related uh fields should be hidden. So

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960
related uh fields should be hidden. So

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.829
related uh fields should be hidden. So for example, you can use it for this. Uh

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839
for example, you can use it for this. Uh

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.750
for example, you can use it for this. Uh out of the box in Ouro, we don't have

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760
out of the box in Ouro, we don't have

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.870
out of the box in Ouro, we don't have any we're not using it on any entity,

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880
any we're not using it on any entity,

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.710
any we're not using it on any entity, but it's there in case you will need it

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720
but it's there in case you will need it

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.309
but it's there in case you will need it in your customizations.

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:12.150
Okay,

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160
Okay,

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.470
Okay, links uh for everything that we talked

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480
links uh for everything that we talked

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.870
links uh for everything that we talked about

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880
about

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.150
about and best practices. You'll see that um

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160
and best practices. You'll see that um

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.990
and best practices. You'll see that um in our controllers we protect um we try

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000
in our controllers we protect um we try

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.390
in our controllers we protect um we try to protect every action. So almost all

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400
to protect every action. So almost all

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.349
to protect every action. So almost all the actions are protected with some ACL.

00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359
the actions are protected with some ACL.

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:31.589
the actions are protected with some ACL. And if you just want to have some

00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599
And if you just want to have some

00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:35.349
And if you just want to have some additional check uh you can use those

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359
additional check uh you can use those

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:38.470
additional check uh you can use those actions capabilities uh for this. So do

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480
actions capabilities uh for this. So do

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.390
actions capabilities uh for this. So do not forget about this ACL because it

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400
not forget about this ACL because it

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.150
not forget about this ACL because it will give you a lot of um

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160
will give you a lot of um

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.069
will give you a lot of um it gives you a lot of configuration and

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079
it gives you a lot of configuration and

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:48.790
it gives you a lot of configuration and you can put uh custom actions and just

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800
you can put uh custom actions and just

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.829
you can put uh custom actions and just with roles and ACL's do something do

00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839
with roles and ACL's do something do

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:57.990
with roles and ACL's do something do some changes on your application.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.710
Okay.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720
search index

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:38.710
search index for this we should have like two hours.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.309
So

00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319

Yes. Yeah. Uh I have a question about delete

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480
Yeah. Uh I have a question about delete

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.990
Yeah. Uh I have a question about delete action.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000
action.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.870
action. Um in in the example from the slides, um

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880
Um in in the example from the slides, um

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.150
Um in in the example from the slides, um it's quite difficult to convert it into

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160
it's quite difficult to convert it into

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.150
it's quite difficult to convert it into into

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160
into

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:39.990
into config into annotation config from

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000
config into annotation config from

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.510
config into annotation config from Okay.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520
Okay.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.589
Okay. [Music]

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:54.870
Okay. So, for delet

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.349
I'm not sure if this is

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359
I'm not sure if this is

00:50:57.359 --> 00:51:00.470
I'm not sure if this is a different I'm using the presentation

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480
a different I'm using the presentation

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.710
a different I'm using the presentation from I mean the the slides

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720
from I mean the the slides

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.470
from I mean the the slides from theory.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480
from theory.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.309
from theory. Okay. So,

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319
Okay. So,

00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:10.390
Okay. So, lights from theory they have the whole

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400
lights from theory they have the whole

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.630
lights from theory they have the whole idea why you don't need to actually

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640
idea why you don't need to actually

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.670
idea why you don't need to actually create an action in the data grid etc.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680
create an action in the data grid etc.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.910
create an action in the data grid etc. The only thing you need to do is specify

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920
The only thing you need to do is specify

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.230
The only thing you need to do is specify this route name in the config section of

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240
this route name in the config section of

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.309
this route name in the config section of your entity. Just remember that this

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319
your entity. Just remember that this

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:25.829
your entity. Just remember that this needs to lead to the index page of the

00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839
needs to lead to the index page of the

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:28.710
needs to lead to the index page of the our usernaming type entity.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720
our usernaming type entity.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.309
our usernaming type entity. Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.470
Okay. Okay. Okay. And then execute this action to update

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480
And then execute this action to update

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.150
And then execute this action to update entity config.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160
entity config.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.150
entity config. Yeah. By the way, uh what is best

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160
Yeah. By the way, uh what is best

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.670
Yeah. By the way, uh what is best practice reviews?

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680
practice reviews?

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.190
practice reviews? annotation or to use attributes. Uh

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200
annotation or to use attributes. Uh

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.790
annotation or to use attributes. Uh actually right now we support only

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800
actually right now we support only

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.470
actually right now we support only annotations

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480
annotations

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.470
annotations and attributes will be available from

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480
and attributes will be available from

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.510
and attributes will be available from Ouro version 6 and we are actually going

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520
Ouro version 6 and we are actually going

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.829
Ouro version 6 and we are actually going to switch to attributes.

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839
to switch to attributes.

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:53.109
to switch to attributes. Okay.

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119
Okay.

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:55.349
Okay. But right now they they are not still

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359
But right now they they are not still

00:51:55.359 --> 00:52:00.470
But right now they they are not still available. They are not yet available.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.950
Um

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960
Um

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.870
Um so yeah I see the the example in the CR

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880
so yeah I see the the example in the CR

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.190
so yeah I see the the example in the CR it leads to the

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200
it leads to the

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.910
it leads to the um task entity with the attribute

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920
um task entity with the attribute

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.950
um task entity with the attribute probably because the link is master

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960
probably because the link is master

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.349
probably because the link is master right

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359
right

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:17.349
right yeah that's correct okay

00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359
yeah that's correct okay

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:20.710
yeah that's correct okay if I check it six then you'll have the

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720
if I check it six then you'll have the

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.069
if I check it six then you'll have the attributes so still now this annotations

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079
attributes so still now this annotations

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:39.670
attributes so still now this annotations from version six you can use attributes

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.150
Yes,

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160
Yes,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.069
Yes, have some issue there. I cannot find

00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079
have some issue there. I cannot find

00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:45.990
have some issue there. I cannot find there. So, it's saying that the router

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000
there. So, it's saying that the router

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.910
there. So, it's saying that the router is not defined. However, previously it

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920
is not defined. However, previously it

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.190
is not defined. However, previously it was like working.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200
was like working.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.030
was like working. Uh I have added two actions

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040
Uh I have added two actions

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.910
Uh I have added two actions for the update and the view lin

00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920
for the update and the view lin

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.630
for the update and the view lin and uh

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640
and uh

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.470
and uh add it to

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480
add it to

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.510
add it to template.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520
template.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.109
template. You were not supposed to create the

00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119
You were not supposed to create the

00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:10.630
You were not supposed to create the updates uh to be honest. And do you have

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640
updates uh to be honest. And do you have

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.829
updates uh to be honest. And do you have updates? Uh

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839
updates? Uh

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:14.790
updates? Uh no, I just copied it. So I just have

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800
no, I just copied it. So I just have

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.109
no, I just copied it. So I just have this update there.

00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119
this update there.

00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:20.230
this update there. Uh and uh yeah,

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240
Uh and uh yeah,

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.470
Uh and uh yeah, but do you have this uh update route in

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480
but do you have this uh update route in

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.150
but do you have this uh update route in your controller? Because if not, it's

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160
your controller? Because if not, it's

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.309
your controller? Because if not, it's trying it will try to find it and it

00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319
trying it will try to find it and it

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:27.829
trying it will try to find it and it will just throw you errors because it

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839
will just throw you errors because it

00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:33.829
will just throw you errors because it does not exist

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:36.230
this one. So what I'm getting I'm

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240
this one. So what I'm getting I'm

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.950
this one. So what I'm getting I'm getting this one. However, just regular

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960
getting this one. However, just regular

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:49.829
getting this one. However, just regular index as far

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:50.549
But I was playing.

00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559
But I was playing.

00:53:50.559 --> 00:53:52.870
But I was playing. Okay. So, it's not finding your index

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880
Okay. So, it's not finding your index

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.430
Okay. So, it's not finding your index action. Can you show me your uh

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440
action. Can you show me your uh

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.910
action. Can you show me your uh index controller? Yeah. And index

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920
index controller? Yeah. And index

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.430
index controller? Yeah. And index controller.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.710
Okay. So, you have issue with namings.

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720
Okay. So, you have issue with namings.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.270
Okay. So, you have issue with namings. Both your view action name and your

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280
Both your view action name and your

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.069
Both your view action name and your index action name is the same. Uh, so

00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079
index action name is the same. Uh, so

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:11.750
index action name is the same. Uh, so it's basically trying to do something

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760
it's basically trying to do something

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.910
it's basically trying to do something but doesn't know what's going on because

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920
but doesn't know what's going on because

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.230
but doesn't know what's going on because you duplicated

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240
you duplicated

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:22.390
you duplicated identifiers.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.270
This name works as identifier and you

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280
This name works as identifier and you

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.870
This name works as identifier and you need to remember to make it unique

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880
need to remember to make it unique

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.150
need to remember to make it unique globally.

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160
globally.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.069
globally. Mhm. That's why we have those naming

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079
Mhm. That's why we have those naming

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:34.790
Mhm. That's why we have those naming convention in naming those routes just

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800
convention in naming those routes just

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.190
convention in naming those routes just to protect from not having duplicates

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200
to protect from not having duplicates

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.510
to protect from not having duplicates there. It seems like it helped because

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520
there. It seems like it helped because

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.270
there. It seems like it helped because your

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280
your

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:59.109
your application is building something.

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:01.510
Okay. Can you switch back to your grid?

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520
Okay. Can you switch back to your grid?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.270
Okay. Can you switch back to your grid? By the way, if you'd like to check what

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280
By the way, if you'd like to check what

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.430
By the way, if you'd like to check what exact error you're having because right

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440
exact error you're having because right

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.069
exact error you're having because right now probably you have some error on data

00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079
now probably you have some error on data

00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:09.910
now probably you have some error on data grid but you will not see it in the

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920
grid but you will not see it in the

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.470
grid but you will not see it in the storefront. You'll see it only in logs.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480
storefront. You'll see it only in logs.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.190
storefront. You'll see it only in logs. And there is one command that I'm using

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200
And there is one command that I'm using

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.150
And there is one command that I'm using always to

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160
always to

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.589
always to just check my logs for new errors and

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599
just check my logs for new errors and

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:24.470
just check my logs for new errors and I'll paste it here. I just use tail for

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480
I'll paste it here. I just use tail for

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.950
I'll paste it here. I just use tail for this and grab errors by criticals.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960
this and grab errors by criticals.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.470
this and grab errors by criticals. Um,

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480
Um,

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.210
Um, okay.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220
okay.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.390
okay. [Music]

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400
[Music]

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.950
[Music] But probably the error is because you

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960
But probably the error is because you

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.069
But probably the error is because you left the in your data grid definition,

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079
left the in your data grid definition,

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:43.270
left the in your data grid definition, you left uh update link which has a

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280
you left uh update link which has a

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.430
you left uh update link which has a route that doesn't exist. So I'm

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440
route that doesn't exist. So I'm

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:54.069
route that doesn't exist. So I'm assuming that that's the cause.

in the data grid definition?

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.270
in the data grid definition? Mhm. uh scroll up to par parameters uh

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280
Mhm. uh scroll up to par parameters uh

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.230
Mhm. uh scroll up to par parameters uh properties you have update link which

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240
properties you have update link which

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.190
properties you have update link which has this route that doesn't exist. So

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200
has this route that doesn't exist. So

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.270
has this route that doesn't exist. So currently currently it's disabled but

yeah I can disable it as well.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.510
yeah I can disable it as well. Uh yeah but the property creation is not

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520
Uh yeah but the property creation is not

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.150
Uh yeah but the property creation is not disabled and you're using this route in

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160
disabled and you're using this route in

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.630
disabled and you're using this route in property creation. You only disabled

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640
property creation. You only disabled

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.190
property creation. You only disabled action. You didn't disable the property

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200
action. You didn't disable the property

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:37.670

yeah.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:41.510
yeah. [Music]

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520
[Music]

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.230
[Music] Yeah. When the data grid is built uh you

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240
Yeah. When the data grid is built uh you

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.069
Yeah. When the data grid is built uh you are creating update link based on the

00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079
are creating update link based on the

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:51.430
are creating update link based on the uh route that doesn't exist. So that was

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440
uh route that doesn't exist. So that was

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.430
uh route that doesn't exist. So that was another property label. Yeah, we don't

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440
another property label. Yeah, we don't

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.349
another property label. Yeah, we don't have a label or username type. We have

00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359
have a label or username type. We have

00:56:55.359 --> 00:56:58.390
have a label or username type. We have only title and format. So, you copied

00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400
only title and format. So, you copied

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.230
only title and format. So, you copied and didn't change probably

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240
and didn't change probably

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.230
and didn't change probably uh in the template. That's in the

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240
uh in the template. That's in the

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.390
uh in the template. That's in the template in the view HTML tweak.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400
template in the view HTML tweak.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:20.309
template in the view HTML tweak. Um yeah, we have title

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:22.390
and do not forget about the content

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400
and do not forget about the content

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.030
and do not forget about the content block because you still didn't pass any

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040
block because you still didn't pass any

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.990
block because you still didn't pass any content to that template only like he

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000
content to that template only like he

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.630
content to that template only like he and something

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640
and something

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.390
and something else.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400
else.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.870
else. Mhm. Yeah. So it's still missing the

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880
Mhm. Yeah. So it's still missing the

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.430
Mhm. Yeah. So it's still missing the part uh the block content data which is

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440
part uh the block content data which is

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.030
part uh the block content data which is important because this template cannot

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040
important because this template cannot

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:46.789
important because this template cannot leave without the uh content data block.

00:57:46.799 --> 00:57:49.190
Yes.

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200

Yes. So preferably do not do it with the

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280
So preferably do not do it with the

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.630
So preferably do not do it with the widget which is in this example

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640
widget which is in this example

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.309
widget which is in this example uh but just render a static elements.

that is not highlighted in yellow. You

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:43.990
that is not highlighted in yellow. You need everything from this block except

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000
need everything from this block except

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.230
need everything from this block except this yellow part because you don't need

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240
this yellow part because you don't need

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.630
this yellow part because you don't need that grid yet. So just to pass some

Where is it? Uh, yeah. Right. I need

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.030
and you just need to create render

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040
and you just need to create render

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.990
and you just need to create render properties. Yeah, basically this just

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000
properties. Yeah, basically this just

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.390
properties. Yeah, basically this just change the parts, right? Because uh

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400
change the parts, right? Because uh

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.230
change the parts, right? Because uh we're rendering

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240
we're rendering

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:32.630
we're rendering we have different label different values

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.549
render property method. It's rendering

00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559
render property method. It's rendering

00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:36.950
render property method. It's rendering this property. Uh first parameter is a

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960
this property. Uh first parameter is a

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.549
this property. Uh first parameter is a label and second parameter is value. So

00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559
label and second parameter is value. So

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.630
label and second parameter is value. So for label you probably want to use your

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640
for label you probably want to use your

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.430
for label you probably want to use your translations if you have them.

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440
translations if you have them.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:53.430
translations if you have them. [Music]

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.549
But you don't have translation for Oh,

00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559
But you don't have translation for Oh,

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:59.910
But you don't have translation for Oh, you have for title field in line six.

00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920
you have for title field in line six.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.789
you have for title field in line six. Uh if you right click on the labor word

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799
Uh if you right click on the labor word

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:06.230
Uh if you right click on the labor word in line six, not this label. This uh you

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240
in line six, not this label. This uh you

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.109
in line six, not this label. This uh you want to put the

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119
want to put the

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:11.910
want to put the um translation for the title field.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920
um translation for the title field.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:22.630
um translation for the title field. Okay. So what was label?

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.710
uh title label. You don't have

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720
uh title label. You don't have

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.309
uh title label. You don't have translation for the title. You have

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319
translation for the title. You have

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:29.990
translation for the title. You have translation for title label.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000
translation for title label.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:41.200
translation for title label. And same for format.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:44.309
[Music]

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319
[Music]

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:46.080
[Music] You have four format.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:46.090
You have four format.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:52.789
You have four format. [Music]

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:55.030
and the values here because you're

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040
and the values here because you're

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.109
and the values here because you're passing entity code and description and

01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119
passing entity code and description and

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.630
passing entity code and description and we don't have entity code and

01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640
we don't have entity code and

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:10.710
we don't have entity code and description

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:19.670
this one. Mhm. Yep.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.789
And you need to change the ID in line 35

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799
And you need to change the ID in line 35

01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:25.109
And you need to change the ID in line 35 because the identifier of the page needs

01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119
because the identifier of the page needs

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:27.589
because the identifier of the page needs to be also unique

01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599
to be also unique

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:31.510
to be also unique um globally just ID that you have in

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520
um globally just ID that you have in

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.630
um globally just ID that you have in line 35.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640
line 35.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.630
line 35. This will be the ID used uh in the

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640
This will be the ID used uh in the

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:51.430
This will be the ID used uh in the listener. So it needs to be unique.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.829
The customer tax code is just variable

01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839
The customer tax code is just variable

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:57.910
The customer tax code is just variable name. So just for it to look better, you

01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920
name. So just for it to look better, you

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.430
name. So just for it to look better, you can change it, but it will still

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440
can change it, but it will still

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.069
can change it, but it will still work.

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079
work.

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:04.950
work. Click on something.

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960
Click on something.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.109
Click on something. Yeah, but can you go back?

01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119

Sure.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.710
Sure. here inside data blocks you're pushing

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720
here inside data blocks you're pushing

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.150
here inside data blocks you're pushing some HTML and this is the variable that

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160
some HTML and this is the variable that

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.910
some HTML and this is the variable that is in line 22

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920
is in line 22

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.630
is in line 22 right

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640
right

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.109
right so you're basically rendering some HTML

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119
so you're basically rendering some HTML

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:21.829
so you're basically rendering some HTML into this variable and then pass this

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839
into this variable and then pass this

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:32.230
into this variable and then pass this variable as a uh data

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:50.470
it should it should work

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.309

get format? Okay, you have string and uh

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.950
get format? Okay, you have string and uh question mark. Okay, that's okay because

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960
question mark. Okay, that's okay because

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.069
question mark. Okay, that's okay because sometimes uh I see that people create

01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079
sometimes uh I see that people create

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:43.829
sometimes uh I see that people create entities and forgetters the return value

01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839
entities and forgetters the return value

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:47.589
entities and forgetters the return value it's hinted to string but when Symfony

01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599
it's hinted to string but when Symfony

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.309
it's hinted to string but when Symfony is actually building forms those fields

01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319
is actually building forms those fields

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:52.870
is actually building forms those fields are sometimes null. So they have a lot

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880
are sometimes null. So they have a lot

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.390
are sometimes null. So they have a lot of errors. I just want to double check

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400
of errors. I just want to double check

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.990
of errors. I just want to double check that you have this question mark. I'm

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000
that you have this question mark. I'm

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.870
that you have this question mark. I'm not sure about this one, but if we find

01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880
not sure about this one, but if we find

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.670
not sure about this one, but if we find set format and probably not static, but

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680
set format and probably not static, but

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.150
set format and probably not static, but just return this

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160
just return this

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.549
just return this self usernaming type.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559
self usernaming type.

01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:07.430
self usernaming type. Yeah,

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440
Yeah,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.430
Yeah, this is type hinting. So you can leave

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440
this is type hinting. So you can leave

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.270
this is type hinting. So you can leave it empty or you can just say self or

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280
it empty or you can just say self or

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:21.269
it empty or you can just say self or usernaming type or whatever. So

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.630
okay, thank you. I think I'll move to

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640

if I could fix it. It's still doing it. Mhm. Okay. Sure, guys. What about you,

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759
Mhm. Okay. Sure, guys. What about you,

01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:35.510
Mhm. Okay. Sure, guys. What about you, Victor Finer?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.349
Hi. uh so for me I have created this

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359
Hi. uh so for me I have created this

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.950
Hi. uh so for me I have created this delete action and also have issues with

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960
delete action and also have issues with

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.189
delete action and also have issues with the searchers I have created file but

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199
the searchers I have created file but

01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:50.950
the searchers I have created file but it's not working and uh trying to

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960
it's not working and uh trying to

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.349
it's not working and uh trying to get the other optional to like add

01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359
get the other optional to like add

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:57.430
get the other optional to like add additional grid for the users which is

01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440
additional grid for the users which is

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.510
additional grid for the users which is uh assign it for this format however

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520
uh assign it for this format however

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.270
uh assign it for this format however didn't find the example so far so

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280
didn't find the example so far so

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.950
didn't find the example so far so stuck on this.

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960
stuck on this.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.229
stuck on this. Mhm. So the example uh to do this uh

01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239
Mhm. So the example uh to do this uh

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.990
Mhm. So the example uh to do this uh will be

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000
will be

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.470
will be I will share screen

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480
I will share screen

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.860
I will share screen on the theory slides.

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:20.070
[Music]

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080
[Music]

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.709
[Music] Okay.

01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:30.229
Six. Number six.

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:33.110
Uh so here where you have this render

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120
Uh so here where you have this render

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.910
Uh so here where you have this render grid example

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920
grid example

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.709
grid example this is actually this part it's

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719
this is actually this part it's

01:10:38.719 --> 01:10:41.189
this is actually this part it's rendering some grid and adding it to

01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199
rendering some grid and adding it to

01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:43.270
rendering some grid and adding it to block actually on this page we have two

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280
block actually on this page we have two

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.750
block actually on this page we have two grids I want to create only one so we

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760
grids I want to create only one so we

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.750
grids I want to create only one so we have first grid and second this is the

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760
have first grid and second this is the

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.750
have first grid and second this is the grid of customer that have the stack

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760
grid of customer that have the stack

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.910
grid of customer that have the stack code and here is how you can bind

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920
code and here is how you can bind

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.990
code and here is how you can bind parameters so you need to pass some

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000
parameters so you need to pass some

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.070
parameters so you need to pass some parameter

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080
parameter

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.149
parameter uh to the to this grid. Then you can

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159
uh to the to this grid. Then you can

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:10.950
uh to the to this grid. Then you can check this grid and

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.910
and this grid uses it like this. You

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920
and this grid uses it like this. You

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.189
and this grid uses it like this. You need to bind this parameter in the in

01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199
need to bind this parameter in the in

01:11:17.199 --> 01:11:19.030
need to bind this parameter in the in this particular place and then you can

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040
this particular place and then you can

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.590
this particular place and then you can use it in the workflows. Okay. Um,

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600
use it in the workflows. Okay. Um,

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.430
use it in the workflows. Okay. Um, so it means that I need create my

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440
so it means that I need create my

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.590
so it means that I need create my separate grid with the source and all

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600
separate grid with the source and all

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.669
separate grid with the source and all the stuff. So I cannot use the existing

01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679
the stuff. So I cannot use the existing

01:11:29.679 --> 01:11:32.229
the stuff. So I cannot use the existing user list.

01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239
user list.

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:36.470
user list. I mean you can but this grid is super

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480
I mean you can but this grid is super

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.590
I mean you can but this grid is super big right this grid that render user

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600
big right this grid that render user

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.630
big right this grid that render user list is actually this one.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640
list is actually this one.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.550
list is actually this one. It's really big. So probably it would be

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560
It's really big. So probably it would be

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.270
It's really big. So probably it would be good to create a brand new

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280
good to create a brand new

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.550
good to create a brand new for this.

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560
for this.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.950
for this. Okay.

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960
Okay.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.630
Okay. And also on the slides from here I think

01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640
And also on the slides from here I think

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.870
And also on the slides from here I think yeah here you have link not to example

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880
yeah here you have link not to example

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.790
yeah here you have link not to example but to documentation.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800
but to documentation.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.669
but to documentation. Yeah that I saw. Yeah I saw that.

01:12:07.679 --> 01:12:10.790
However it's not. So for the first uh

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800
However it's not. So for the first uh

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.870
However it's not. So for the first uh task that's optional. So the grid to

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880
task that's optional. So the grid to

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.709
task that's optional. So the grid to create the

01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719
create the

01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:18.470
create the uh format parameter bendions to to get

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480
uh format parameter bendions to to get

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.110
uh format parameter bendions to to get the users who use this format. Uh I'm

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120
the users who use this format. Uh I'm

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.709
the users who use this format. Uh I'm not sure is okay. So it's like the grid

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719
not sure is okay. So it's like the grid

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.350
not sure is okay. So it's like the grid and then we have the the extension to

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360
and then we have the the extension to

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.550
and then we have the the extension to render examples of huder name it on the

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560
render examples of huder name it on the

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.070
render examples of huder name it on the format.

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080
format.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.310
format. Mhm. So basically it goes to the fact

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320
Mhm. So basically it goes to the fact

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:42.390
Mhm. So basically it goes to the fact that whenever I get this display my

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400
that whenever I get this display my

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.910
that whenever I get this display my like official here I will have a grid of

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920
like official here I will have a grid of

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.910
like official here I will have a grid of users that have this format assigned. So

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920
users that have this format assigned. So

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.870
users that have this format assigned. So mine is empty but then when I go to

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880
mine is empty but then when I go to

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.709
mine is empty but then when I go to users and this is official. Okay. So

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719
users and this is official. Okay. So

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:58.070
users and this is official. Okay. So let's edit one of them

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080
let's edit one of them

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.630
let's edit one of them and actually assign the official.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640
and actually assign the official.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.830
and actually assign the official. So at least one of the users have this

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840
So at least one of the users have this

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.550
So at least one of the users have this official set and now it should this one

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560
official set and now it should this one

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.790
official set and now it should this one single user should appear on this list.

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800
single user should appear on this list.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.830
single user should appear on this list. Okay. So we have a data grid that has a

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840
Okay. So we have a data grid that has a

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.390
Okay. So we have a data grid that has a work clause right. So we're passing the

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400
work clause right. So we're passing the

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.870
work clause right. So we're passing the identifier of our current entity

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880
identifier of our current entity

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.030
identifier of our current entity usernaming type and then filtering list

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040
usernaming type and then filtering list

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.470
usernaming type and then filtering list of users sorry uh by this uh ID.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480
of users sorry uh by this uh ID.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.790
of users sorry uh by this uh ID. Right. But isn't it the first task like

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800
Right. But isn't it the first task like

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.990
Right. But isn't it the first task like to create uh crit for the customer

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000
to create uh crit for the customer

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.430
to create uh crit for the customer assign it to it? So I'm asking about the

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440
assign it to it? So I'm asking about the

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.709
assign it to it? So I'm asking about the other one which is sounds like add

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719
other one which is sounds like add

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.950
other one which is sounds like add extension to render example of user

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960
extension to render example of user

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.270
extension to render example of user name.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280
name.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.070
name. Yeah.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080
Yeah.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.310
Yeah. Yeah, that's just a tweak extension. So

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320
Yeah, that's just a tweak extension. So

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.310
Yeah, that's just a tweak extension. So in case you want to

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320
in case you want to

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.550
in case you want to I I'm not sure what the result supposed

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560
I I'm not sure what the result supposed

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.669
I I'm not sure what the result supposed to be. I

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679
to be. I

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:58.870
to be. I I mean at the end if it's I did this for

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880
I mean at the end if it's I did this for

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.830
I mean at the end if it's I did this for Okay guys since this is optional part.

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840
Okay guys since this is optional part.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.229
Okay guys since this is optional part. Mhm.

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239
Mhm.

01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:04.390
Mhm. So let me actually maybe show you the

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400
So let me actually maybe show you the

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.470
So let me actually maybe show you the solution for optional parts for all of

01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480
solution for optional parts for all of

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.910
solution for optional parts for all of them. So you can check uh on your site

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920
them. So you can check uh on your site

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.870
them. So you can check uh on your site uh and maybe fill in some gaps

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880
uh and maybe fill in some gaps

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.189
uh and maybe fill in some gaps and there we're going to actually switch

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199
and there we're going to actually switch

01:14:15.199 --> 01:14:17.910
and there we're going to actually switch to the ACL and if you'll have enough

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920
to the ACL and if you'll have enough

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.070
to the ACL and if you'll have enough time you'll be able to to continue with

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080
time you'll be able to to continue with

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.390
time you'll be able to to continue with optional. Okay. Guess it's been like two

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400
optional. Okay. Guess it's been like two

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.750
optional. Okay. Guess it's been like two hours and I need to

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760
hours and I need to

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.350
hours and I need to um

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360
um

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.390
um go to next topic.

01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400
go to next topic.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.630
go to next topic. So uh okay, Vladimir, what about you?

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640
So uh okay, Vladimir, what about you?

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.669
So uh okay, Vladimir, what about you? Because uh are you ready with

01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:39.910
nonoptional parts? Probably yes because

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920
nonoptional parts? Probably yes because

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.590
nonoptional parts? Probably yes because you asked already about delete. So

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600
you asked already about delete. So

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.750
you asked already about delete. So yeah, so I finished uh this part as

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760
yeah, so I finished uh this part as

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.990
yeah, so I finished uh this part as well. I started to work on search but

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000
well. I started to work on search but

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.070
well. I started to work on search but just started so

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.709
okay so this tweak extension optional

01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719
okay so this tweak extension optional

01:14:58.719 --> 01:15:02.149
okay so this tweak extension optional part this is actually something that I

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159
part this is actually something that I

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:05.030
part this is actually something that I uh I don't really need you to do because

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040
uh I don't really need you to do because

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.270
uh I don't really need you to do because this is not connected to oral this is

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280
this is not connected to oral this is

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.270
this is not connected to oral this is connected directly to tweak so you can

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280
connected directly to tweak so you can

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.669
connected directly to tweak so you can check do this part later I will just

01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679
check do this part later I will just

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:15.189
check do this part later I will just show you the solution and always you

01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199
show you the solution and always you

01:15:15.199 --> 01:15:19.270
show you the solution and always you have the reference uh

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.550
to the for the code in the repository.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560
to the for the code in the repository.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.630
to the for the code in the repository. Uh so you're done with this part. I'm

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640
Uh so you're done with this part. I'm

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.270
Uh so you're done with this part. I'm just going to

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.750
[Music]

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760
[Music]

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.709
[Music] I I did

01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719
I I did

01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:40.950
I I did I I rendered list of users uh

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960
I I rendered list of users uh

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.510
I I rendered list of users uh in on the view page and that's all what

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520
in on the view page and that's all what

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.350
in on the view page and that's all what I did.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.510
Mhm.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.630
So you have a view page

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640
So you have a view page

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.910
So you have a view page and you have row action and delete

01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920
and you have row action and delete

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.229
and you have row action and delete action. View action and delete action on

01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239
action. View action and delete action on

01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:02.149
action. View action and delete action on data grid. Right?

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159
data grid. Right?

01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:04.229
data grid. Right? Yeah. So this was basically what you

01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239
Yeah. So this was basically what you

01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:06.229
Yeah. So this was basically what you were supposed to do. All the other parts

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239
were supposed to do. All the other parts

01:16:06.239 --> 01:16:09.430
were supposed to do. All the other parts are optional. Uh actually this optional

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440
are optional. Uh actually this optional

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.750
are optional. Uh actually this optional element is interesting and the last

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760
element is interesting and the last

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.149
element is interesting and the last optional element is interesting and this

01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159
optional element is interesting and this

01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:17.669
optional element is interesting and this I'm going to focus on and if you want to

01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679
I'm going to focus on and if you want to

01:16:17.679 --> 01:16:19.590
I'm going to focus on and if you want to have some time to finish this part on

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600
have some time to finish this part on

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.830
have some time to finish this part on your side okay I can give it to you

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840
your side okay I can give it to you

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.149
your side okay I can give it to you because this is actually interesting. Uh

01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159
because this is actually interesting. Uh

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:26.310
because this is actually interesting. Uh but regarding this tweak extension, I'm

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320
but regarding this tweak extension, I'm

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.149
but regarding this tweak extension, I'm not eager actually to do it because

01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159
not eager actually to do it because

01:16:28.159 --> 01:16:31.669
not eager actually to do it because that's totally like something to

01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679
that's totally like something to

01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:34.070
that's totally like something to if you finish the practice very very

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080
if you finish the practice very very

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.030
if you finish the practice very very quickly than for you not to be bored

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040
quickly than for you not to be bored

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.950
quickly than for you not to be bored with something to have something to do

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960
with something to have something to do

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.590
with something to have something to do because this is not like this is just a

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600
because this is not like this is just a

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.630
because this is not like this is just a tweak extension. So

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640
tweak extension. So

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.790
tweak extension. So I will start from explaining this in

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800
I will start from explaining this in

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.350
I will start from explaining this in case you have on your site it almost

01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360
case you have on your site it almost

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.510
case you have on your site it almost ready maybe me showing you solution will

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520
ready maybe me showing you solution will

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.149
ready maybe me showing you solution will just tell you give you some hints how to

01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159
just tell you give you some hints how to

01:16:54.159 --> 01:16:59.910
just tell you give you some hints how to finish it on your site.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.950
Okay.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:11.430
So,

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.229
okay, I will just close all tabs.

01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239
okay, I will just close all tabs.

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:20.229
okay, I will just close all tabs. Okay, so uh we are supposed to render

01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239
Okay, so uh we are supposed to render

01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:23.750
Okay, so uh we are supposed to render and this is what I just shown you on

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760
and this is what I just shown you on

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.669
and this is what I just shown you on this view page. You you have this one.

01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679
this view page. You you have this one.

01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:29.430
this view page. You you have this one. This is actually done with this tweak

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440
This is actually done with this tweak

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.149
This is actually done with this tweak extension. So I will show you also how

01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159
extension. So I will show you also how

01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:34.229
extension. So I will show you also how uh this grid but this grid is supposed

01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239
uh this grid but this grid is supposed

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.470
uh this grid but this grid is supposed to be grid of users but not all of them

01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480
to be grid of users but not all of them

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.550
to be grid of users but not all of them only those who have this usernaming type

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560
only those who have this usernaming type

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.590
only those who have this usernaming type assigned. So my user has actually this

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600
assigned. So my user has actually this

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.070
assigned. So my user has actually this usernaming type assigned.

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080
usernaming type assigned.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.310
usernaming type assigned. That's why this user is visible on this

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320
That's why this user is visible on this

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.030
That's why this user is visible on this data grid. So for this we actually

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040
data grid. So for this we actually

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.910
data grid. So for this we actually decided to create uh in this training uh

01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920
decided to create uh in this training uh

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.870
decided to create uh in this training uh repository to create a separate uh grid

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880
repository to create a separate uh grid

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.510
repository to create a separate uh grid for those users uh because the original

01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520
for those users uh because the original

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.189
for those users uh because the original grid of users is really big and

01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199
grid of users is really big and

01:17:59.199 --> 01:18:01.350
grid of users is really big and complicated and we don't need all this

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360
complicated and we don't need all this

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.110
complicated and we don't need all this information in here. We basically just

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120
information in here. We basically just

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.709
information in here. We basically just need username, first name, last name.

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719
need username, first name, last name.

01:18:04.719 --> 01:18:08.070
need username, first name, last name. That's uh that's enough.

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080
That's uh that's enough.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.510
That's uh that's enough. So

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.470
and the whole idea here is just to show

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480
and the whole idea here is just to show

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.790
and the whole idea here is just to show you how to bind parameters. So for this

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800
you how to bind parameters. So for this

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.990
you how to bind parameters. So for this this data grid to display it, we need to

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000
this data grid to display it, we need to

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.189
this data grid to display it, we need to pass the identifier of our user naming

01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199
pass the identifier of our user naming

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:26.950
pass the identifier of our user naming type and then create a work condition in

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960
type and then create a work condition in

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.270
type and then create a work condition in our data grid and filter list of users

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280
our data grid and filter list of users

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.709
our data grid and filter list of users by only those who have naming type this

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719
by only those who have naming type this

01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:37.350
by only those who have naming type this particular one official number one.

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360
particular one official number one.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.430
particular one official number one. Okay. So the data greetings itself it's

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440
Okay. So the data greetings itself it's

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.189
Okay. So the data greetings itself it's short

01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199
short

01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:47.189
short just some our name

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199
just some our name

01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:49.590
just some our name do not bother about this this is the ACL

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600
do not bother about this this is the ACL

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.350
do not bother about this this is the ACL task and um similar to what we had here

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360
task and um similar to what we had here

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.990
task and um similar to what we had here we are fetching data usernaming types

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000
we are fetching data usernaming types

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.070
we are fetching data usernaming types and we're doing the same here we're

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080
and we're doing the same here we're

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.790
and we're doing the same here we're fetching username first name last name

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800
fetching username first name last name

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.669
fetching username first name last name from user table and then displaying

01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679
from user table and then displaying

01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:07.110
from user table and then displaying those three columns uh then we need to

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120
those three columns uh then we need to

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.870
those three columns uh then we need to pass to this data grid uh the ID of our

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880
pass to this data grid uh the ID of our

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.510
pass to this data grid uh the ID of our naming type and put it in the work

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520
naming type and put it in the work

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.630
naming type and put it in the work clause. So we're binding some parameter

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640
clause. So we're binding some parameter

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.709
clause. So we're binding some parameter under this parameter we're going in the

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719
under this parameter we're going in the

01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:21.270
under this parameter we're going in the template we're going to pass the ID of

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280
template we're going to pass the ID of

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.070
template we're going to pass the ID of our usernaming type

01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080
our usernaming type

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.550
our usernaming type and now my um naming type was added

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560
and now my um naming type was added

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.990
and now my um naming type was added under this name. This goes directly to

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000
under this name. This goes directly to

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.750
under this name. This goes directly to my

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760
my

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.750
my migration that I have here and to the

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760
migration that I have here and to the

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.189
migration that I have here and to the association name

01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199
association name

01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:42.790
association name and uh this is the way you can fetch the

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800
and uh this is the way you can fetch the

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.790
and uh this is the way you can fetch the ID right because this is uh relation.

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800
ID right because this is uh relation.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.709
ID right because this is uh relation. So in this case you can use this way you

01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719
So in this case you can use this way you

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.350
So in this case you can use this way you can also fetch it differently but

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360
can also fetch it differently but

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.030
can also fetch it differently but basically the identity will give you the

01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040
basically the identity will give you the

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.390
basically the identity will give you the identity of related entity. Okay. and it

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400
identity of related entity. Okay. and it

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:04.310
identity of related entity. Okay. and it needs to be equal to past id. So in my

01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320
needs to be equal to past id. So in my

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.910
needs to be equal to past id. So in my case it will I will pass one

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920
case it will I will pass one

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.229
case it will I will pass one and it will be

01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239
and it will be

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:13.030
and it will be bound to my data grid as a parameter

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040
bound to my data grid as a parameter

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.709
bound to my data grid as a parameter under this value and I will I'm adding

01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719
under this value and I will I'm adding

01:20:16.719 --> 01:20:18.550
under this value and I will I'm adding work loss and displaying the list of

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560
work loss and displaying the list of

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.310
work loss and displaying the list of users but only those who have this

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320
users but only those who have this

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:24.470
users but only those who have this naming type assigned

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480
naming type assigned

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.189
naming type assigned and the second part was to render this

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199
and the second part was to render this

01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:30.149
and the second part was to render this data grid and pass this particular

01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159
data grid and pass this particular

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:34.390
data grid and pass this particular parameter to it. So on the view page we

01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400
parameter to it. So on the view page we

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.110
parameter to it. So on the view page we have

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120
have

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.510
have first we need to import our data grid

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520
first we need to import our data grid

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.950
first we need to import our data grid macros because those macro uh they have

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960
macros because those macro uh they have

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.229
macros because those macro uh they have uh methods inside to render data grids

01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239
uh methods inside to render data grids

01:20:46.239 --> 01:20:49.910
uh methods inside to render data grids in HTML tweak. So we are importing that

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920
in HTML tweak. So we are importing that

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.189
in HTML tweak. So we are importing that and then in the content data block

01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199
and then in the content data block

01:20:53.199 --> 01:20:56.870
and then in the content data block we are using it and rendering a grid.

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880
we are using it and rendering a grid.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.870
we are using it and rendering a grid. This is the name of the grid that I just

01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880
This is the name of the grid that I just

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:04.630
This is the name of the grid that I just created here. same one and we're passing

01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:04.640
created here. same one and we're passing

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.390
created here. same one and we're passing we are on the view page of our

01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400
we are on the view page of our

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.110
we are on the view page of our usernaming type. So under entity we have

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120
usernaming type. So under entity we have

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.669
usernaming type. So under entity we have our usernaming type. So we are basically

01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679
our usernaming type. So we are basically

01:21:11.679 --> 01:21:14.870
our usernaming type. So we are basically passing the ID to the data grid inside

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880
passing the ID to the data grid inside

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.590
passing the ID to the data grid inside this parameter naming type ID and this

01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600
this parameter naming type ID and this

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.550
this parameter naming type ID and this goes to this. So basically new grid

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560
goes to this. So basically new grid

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.270
goes to this. So basically new grid work close with pass with bound

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280
work close with pass with bound

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.310
work close with pass with bound parameter and passing parameter here.

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320
parameter and passing parameter here.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.110
parameter and passing parameter here. Uh we're rendering this into variable of

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120
Uh we're rendering this into variable of

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.910
Uh we're rendering this into variable of course and then adding second block and

01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920
course and then adding second block and

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:44.630
course and then adding second block and filling it with our rendered data grid.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:50.229
Okay.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.750
Then

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760
Then

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.709
Then let's switch to the search

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719
let's switch to the search

01:21:54.719 --> 01:21:56.950
let's switch to the search part.

01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960
part.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.430
part. Um, so to make usernaming type

01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440
Um, so to make usernaming type

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.990
Um, so to make usernaming type searchable. So we want basically to be

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000
searchable. So we want basically to be

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.550
searchable. So we want basically to be able to type here

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.790
official and to be able to search for

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800
official and to be able to search for

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.629
official and to be able to search for it.

01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639
it.

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.990
it. So what we need to do

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000
So what we need to do

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.229
So what we need to do uh and we want to index only title

01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239
uh and we want to index only title

01:22:16.239 --> 01:22:18.390
uh and we want to index only title fields. So our configuration will will

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400
fields. So our configuration will will

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.990
fields. So our configuration will will be very very short. Uh search results uh

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000
be very very short. Uh search results uh

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.070
be very very short. Uh search results uh row has to redirect to view page. So

01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080
row has to redirect to view page. So

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.030
row has to redirect to view page. So basically we want to have

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040
basically we want to have

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.070
basically we want to have standard view here. So the name that is

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080
standard view here. So the name that is

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.470
standard view here. So the name that is also a link to a view page and uh search

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480
also a link to a view page and uh search

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.870
also a link to a view page and uh search results row has to show format. So down

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880
results row has to show format. So down

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.990
results row has to show format. So down below here uh for other entities for

01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000
below here uh for other entities for

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.910
below here uh for other entities for example like

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.629
um contacts we have here created at

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639
um contacts we have here created at

01:22:46.639 --> 01:22:49.590
um contacts we have here created at updated at but we want to display here

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600
updated at but we want to display here

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.910
updated at but we want to display here uh format

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920
uh format

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.350
uh format something nice happened with to my

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360
something nice happened with to my

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.830
something nice happened with to my search index I will reindex in a second

01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840
search index I will reindex in a second

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.149
search index I will reindex in a second uh so it should be back again to okay

01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159
uh so it should be back again to okay

01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:06.229
uh so it should be back again to okay um okay so for this we need just two

01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239
um okay so for this we need just two

01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:08.629
um okay so for this we need just two elements. We need to add this

01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639
elements. We need to add this

01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:11.189
elements. We need to add this configuration in search yamu and tell

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199
configuration in search yamu and tell

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:13.510
configuration in search yamu and tell index that we want to index username

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520
index that we want to index username

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.390
index that we want to index username type entity but we also want to index

01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400
type entity but we also want to index

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.950
type entity but we also want to index only title field. So for this

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960
only title field. So for this

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.270
only title field. So for this we have search file inside resources

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280
we have search file inside resources

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.750
we have search file inside resources config oro so it will be autoloaded.

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760
config oro so it will be autoloaded.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.709
config oro so it will be autoloaded. Then we have search name space fully

01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719
Then we have search name space fully

01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:31.669
Then we have search name space fully qualified class name of our entity.

01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679
qualified class name of our entity.

01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:35.430
qualified class name of our entity. Uh we added here some alias and the

01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440
Uh we added here some alias and the

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.950
Uh we added here some alias and the definition for fields. We want to index

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960
definition for fields. We want to index

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.830
definition for fields. We want to index only title field and in the search

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840
only title field and in the search

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.070
only title field and in the search engine we also have it want to have it

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080
engine we also have it want to have it

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.629
engine we also have it want to have it under the uh title field. Uh then those

01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639
under the uh title field. Uh then those

01:23:48.639 --> 01:23:50.629
under the uh title field. Uh then those uh elements are regarding the second

01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639
uh elements are regarding the second

01:23:50.639 --> 01:23:52.709
uh elements are regarding the second part. So the template and we need to

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719
part. So the template and we need to

01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:54.950
part. So the template and we need to create this template

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960
create this template

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.110
create this template and this type template will render a

01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120
and this type template will render a

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.350
and this type template will render a link to view page. That's why we need

01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360
link to view page. That's why we need

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.550
link to view page. That's why we need this section route name. This is the

01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560
this section route name. This is the

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.430
this section route name. This is the route for the view page. And this

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440
route for the view page. And this

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.149
route for the view page. And this directly goes to controller

01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159
directly goes to controller

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:11.590
directly goes to controller view action route. This one, this my

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600
view action route. This one, this my

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.750
view action route. This one, this my view action. This is the name of my

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760
view action. This is the name of my

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.950
view action. This is the name of my route. So this goes here. And we need to

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960
route. So this goes here. And we need to

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.430
route. So this goes here. And we need to pass ID. And then we need to create a

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440
pass ID. And then we need to create a

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.470
pass ID. And then we need to create a search template. And you have also

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480
search template. And you have also

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.590
search template. And you have also example here.

01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600
example here.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.350
example here. and the search template. Uh yes, uh you

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360
and the search template. Uh yes, uh you

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.590
and the search template. Uh yes, uh you need to pass the path, right? So this

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600
need to pass the path, right? So this

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.149
need to pass the path, right? So this will lead us to our resources views in

01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159
will lead us to our resources views in

01:24:36.159 --> 01:24:39.030
will lead us to our resources views in the training usernaming. So let's go to

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040
the training usernaming. So let's go to

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.149
the training usernaming. So let's go to resources views. We decided to put it

01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159
resources views. We decided to put it

01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:46.390
resources views. We decided to put it inside usernaming search. You can put it

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400
inside usernaming search. You can put it

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.709
inside usernaming search. You can put it anywhere you like. And this is our

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719
anywhere you like. And this is our

01:24:48.719 --> 01:24:53.030
anywhere you like. And this is our result row HTML tweak. Uh and this is

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040
result row HTML tweak. Uh and this is

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.990
result row HTML tweak. Uh and this is basically copied from the uh from the

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000
basically copied from the uh from the

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.590
basically copied from the uh from the example that you have on the slides.

01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600
example that you have on the slides.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.229
example that you have on the slides. That's why we have also this hints here.

01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239
That's why we have also this hints here.

01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:02.149
That's why we have also this hints here. And we have two elements entity and

01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159
And we have two elements entity and

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:04.950
And we have two elements entity and indexer item here. You need to extend

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960
indexer item here. You need to extend

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.550
indexer item here. You need to extend our base template.

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560
our base template.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.189
our base template. And the important parts from this yeah

01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199
And the important parts from this yeah

01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:15.669
And the important parts from this yeah basically record URL it's all also

01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679
basically record URL it's all also

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:18.149
basically record URL it's all also always taken from the indexed item and

01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159
always taken from the indexed item and

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:20.550
always taken from the indexed item and is generated based on this part. Right.

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560
is generated based on this part. Right.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.430
is generated based on this part. Right. So we need to pass this this part. We

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440
So we need to pass this this part. We

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.910
So we need to pass this this part. We don't have any image on our entity. So

01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920
don't have any image on our entity. So

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.229
don't have any image on our entity. So that's it. Uh title is entity title.

01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239
that's it. Uh title is entity title.

01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:33.030
that's it. Uh title is entity title. Entity type. This is what's going to be

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040
Entity type. This is what's going to be

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.830
Entity type. This is what's going to be displayed here on the right.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840
displayed here on the right.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.790
displayed here on the right. So for us this will be usernaming type.

01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800
So for us this will be usernaming type.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.030
So for us this will be usernaming type. That's why we passed here

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.070
uh entity name. But basically you can

01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080
uh entity name. But basically you can

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.590
uh entity name. But basically you can also go with translation. So this is for

01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600
also go with translation. So this is for

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.990
also go with translation. So this is for in my opinion over complicated. I'd even

01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000
in my opinion over complicated. I'd even

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.830
in my opinion over complicated. I'd even change it to just translation.

01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840
change it to just translation.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.709
change it to just translation. Uh like this we have plural entity

01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719
Uh like this we have plural entity

01:25:58.719 --> 01:26:05.990
Uh like this we have plural entity label. Okay.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.790
And uh in the entity info. So down here

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800
And uh in the entity info. So down here

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.870
And uh in the entity info. So down here we are supposed to display format not

01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880
we are supposed to display format not

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.030
we are supposed to display format not created at or updated at but only

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040
created at or updated at but only

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.270
created at or updated at but only format. So we're going to have only one

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280
format. So we're going to have only one

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.990
format. So we're going to have only one element here. and title

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000
element here. and title

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.030
element here. and title is this left part. So title is uh

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040
is this left part. So title is uh

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.149
is this left part. So title is uh basically label for format and value is

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159
basically label for format and value is

01:26:28.159 --> 01:26:31.750
basically label for format and value is our format.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.310
After you'll have those two elements,

01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320
After you'll have those two elements,

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.550
After you'll have those two elements, you need to still execute the command to

01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560
you need to still execute the command to

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:46.470
you need to still execute the command to run uh search index.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.270
Okay. Oral search index.

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280
Okay. Oral search index.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.950
Okay. Oral search index. I'm not going to push it through message

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960
I'm not going to push it through message

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.669
I'm not going to push it through message Q because my application is super small.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679
Q because my application is super small.

01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:57.270
Q because my application is super small. Okay.

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280
Okay.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.910
Okay. And right now according to this

01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920
And right now according to this

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.430
And right now according to this configuration

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440
configuration

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.709
configuration I should have in my index index my

01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719
I should have in my index index my

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.990
I should have in my index index my entity but only title field. Okay. So

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000
entity but only title field. Okay. So

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.430
entity but only title field. Okay. So right now when I search

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.990
for

01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000
for

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.510
for official

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:26.229
I have result here. I should also

01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239
I have result here. I should also

01:27:26.239 --> 01:27:29.590
I have result here. I should also have autocomplete

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.470
for some reason I h not here. Sorry.

01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480
for some reason I h not here. Sorry.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.709
for some reason I h not here. Sorry. Okay. Here

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:41.189
I have autocomplete that I have some

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199
I have autocomplete that I have some

01:27:41.199 --> 01:27:43.430
I have autocomplete that I have some username type with this particular

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440
username type with this particular

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.229
username type with this particular title.

01:27:48.239 --> 01:27:50.470
And here on this results list I have

01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480
And here on this results list I have

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.790
And here on this results list I have this record rendered. We have a link to

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800
this record rendered. We have a link to

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.669
this record rendered. We have a link to the view page and we have the format

01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679
the view page and we have the format

01:27:57.679 --> 01:28:01.510
the view page and we have the format down there.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:09.830
Is it more clear for you now?

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.189
Yes. Yes. Um I have a question. Uh can

01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199
Yes. Yes. Um I have a question. Uh can

01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:18.870
Yes. Yes. Um I have a question. Uh can we can we create um open search um

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880
we can we create um open search um

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.750
we can we create um open search um which will include only one entity? You

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760
which will include only one entity? You

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.510
which will include only one entity? You see it's a pension all but

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520
see it's a pension all but

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.470
see it's a pension all but I'd like to have a search

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480
I'd like to have a search

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:40.790
I'd like to have a search um by users only.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.270
So in index you basically have

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280
So in index you basically have

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.310
So in index you basically have everything. So you will need to create

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320
everything. So you will need to create

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.470
everything. So you will need to create some custom

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480
some custom

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.910
some custom uh like input form type that will search

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920
uh like input form type that will search

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.790
uh like input form type that will search in only in the

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800
in only in the

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:58.709
in only in the only in the users. So you can

01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719
only in the users. So you can

01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:01.990
only in the users. So you can use the search handler the one that we

01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000
use the search handler the one that we

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.510
use the search handler the one that we have for example here

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520
have for example here

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.070
have for example here but that would be basically custom input

01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080
but that would be basically custom input

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.590
but that would be basically custom input then that is doing custom uh search

01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600
then that is doing custom uh search

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.550
then that is doing custom uh search queries to the index because by default

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560
queries to the index because by default

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.750
queries to the index because by default we have everything there.

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760
we have everything there.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.470
we have everything there. Okay. So just to clarify uh that uh

01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480
Okay. So just to clarify uh that uh

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.590
Okay. So just to clarify uh that uh search YAML file um it's part of this

01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600
search YAML file um it's part of this

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.350
search YAML file um it's part of this I'd say bundle search uh global search

01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360
I'd say bundle search uh global search

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.750
I'd say bundle search uh global search only and that's all.

01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760
only and that's all.

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.310
only and that's all. Mhm.

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320
Mhm.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.629
Mhm. Can be extended

01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639
Can be extended

01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:42.470
Can be extended custom.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.110
So, if you So, if you click the search

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120
So, if you So, if you click the search

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.629
So, if you So, if you click the search icon in the header and you just type

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639
icon in the header and you just type

01:29:46.639 --> 01:29:48.229
icon in the header and you just type official,

01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239
official,

01:29:48.239 --> 01:29:50.709
official, does it I just want to see if it's doing

01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719
does it I just want to see if it's doing

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:51.990
does it I just want to see if it's doing the same thing for you that it's doing

01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000
the same thing for you that it's doing

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.990
the same thing for you that it's doing for me.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.030
Oh, yours is even worse than mine. Mine

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040
Oh, yours is even worse than mine. Mine

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.110
Oh, yours is even worse than mine. Mine mine shows like the title. It'll show

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120
mine shows like the title. It'll show

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.270
mine shows like the title. It'll show official and then next to it, it shows

01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280
official and then next to it, it shows

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.030
official and then next to it, it shows the format. So, I was looking in how to

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040
the format. So, I was looking in how to

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.870
the format. So, I was looking in how to like override the autocomplete which I

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880
like override the autocomplete which I

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.629
like override the autocomplete which I think we talked about. yesterday and I

01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639
think we talked about. yesterday and I

01:30:14.639 --> 01:30:16.629
think we talked about. yesterday and I may have gotten it. You need to make

01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639
may have gotten it. You need to make

01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:18.070
may have gotten it. You need to make like it looks like you need to do some

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080
like it looks like you need to do some

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.189
like it looks like you need to do some sort of select type class thing. I was

01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199
sort of select type class thing. I was

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:22.629
sort of select type class thing. I was looking at the way the contact

01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639
looking at the way the contact

01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:25.669
looking at the way the contact that's that's particular type. It's

01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679
that's that's particular type. It's

01:30:25.679 --> 01:30:29.030
that's that's particular type. It's actually custom one. uh because as you

01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040
actually custom one. uh because as you

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.110
actually custom one. uh because as you can see we have also here some drop

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120
can see we have also here some drop

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.470
can see we have also here some drop please that is prefiltering it and in

01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480
please that is prefiltering it and in

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.709
please that is prefiltering it and in case for example you want to search only

01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719
case for example you want to search only

01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:39.030
case for example you want to search only by users but you you don't want to

01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040
by users but you you don't want to

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.590
by users but you you don't want to restrict the search to see only users so

01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600
restrict the search to see only users so

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.070
restrict the search to see only users so you can kind of do it here just to you

01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080
you can kind of do it here just to you

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.470
you can kind of do it here just to you know select that okay from users only

01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480
know select that okay from users only

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.629
know select that okay from users only but I do still have option to search by

01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639
but I do still have option to search by

01:30:50.639 --> 01:30:53.669
but I do still have option to search by other elements so this is partially

01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679
other elements so this is partially

01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:56.310
other elements so this is partially maybe what you wanted Vladimir but

01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320
maybe what you wanted Vladimir but

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.830
maybe what you wanted Vladimir but basically I still can search by

01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840
basically I still can search by

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.070
basically I still can search by everything but I can filter this out. So

01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080
everything but I can filter this out. So

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.189
everything but I can filter this out. So this is kind of custom

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199
this is kind of custom

01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:06.950
this is kind of custom and uh I will need to find

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960
and uh I will need to find

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.669
and uh I will need to find implementation of this particular part

01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679
implementation of this particular part

01:31:09.679 --> 01:31:12.229
implementation of this particular part to tell you from where it's actually

01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239
to tell you from where it's actually

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:13.990
to tell you from where it's actually fetching

01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000
fetching

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.430
fetching uh

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.430
values.

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440
values.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.950
values. Yeah, it seems I don't know what the

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960
Yeah, it seems I don't know what the

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.629
Yeah, it seems I don't know what the default behavior is. It just seems to

01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639
default behavior is. It just seems to

01:31:22.639 --> 01:31:25.110
default behavior is. It just seems to stuff like it's taking the title and the

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120
stuff like it's taking the title and the

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.590
stuff like it's taking the title and the format slapping them together via

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600
format slapping them together via

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.990
format slapping them together via concatenation and that's what like the

01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000
concatenation and that's what like the

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.310
concatenation and that's what like the autocomplete shows all of that and then

01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320
autocomplete shows all of that and then

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.310
autocomplete shows all of that and then it shows usernaming type at the bottom.

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320
it shows usernaming type at the bottom.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.990
it shows usernaming type at the bottom. Yours is not showing a title at all

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000
Yours is not showing a title at all

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.830
Yours is not showing a title at all which is strange.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.590
This is showing me uh the type of this

01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600
This is showing me uh the type of this

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.790
This is showing me uh the type of this entity. Yeah, but I also get a title

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800
entity. Yeah, but I also get a title

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.629
entity. Yeah, but I also get a title above that

01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:53.189
when I and I just did the B same thing

01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199
when I and I just did the B same thing

01:31:53.199 --> 01:31:55.030
when I and I just did the B same thing you did.

01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040
you did.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.550
you did. So I don't I don't know why I'm getting

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560
So I don't I don't know why I'm getting

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.550
So I don't I don't know why I'm getting different behavior then. Is it not

01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560
different behavior then. Is it not

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.189
different behavior then. Is it not supposed to show me like a preview of

01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199
supposed to show me like a preview of

01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:02.870
supposed to show me like a preview of the matching records? Like if you search

01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880
the matching records? Like if you search

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:06.229
the matching records? Like if you search for John or something like a name like

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239
for John or something like a name like

01:32:06.239 --> 01:32:09.590
for John or something like a name like how do I get it to do this?

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600
how do I get it to do this?

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.390
how do I get it to do this? Like it's showing me individual users

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400
Like it's showing me individual users

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:16.629
Like it's showing me individual users and contacts.

01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:18.550
Is that like the autocomplete stuff or

01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560
Is that like the autocomplete stuff or

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:26.310
Is that like the autocomplete stuff or is it a separate configuration

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.550
that behind this there is for sure a

01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560
that behind this there is for sure a

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.430
that behind this there is for sure a template that is displaying this but I

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440
template that is displaying this but I

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.510
template that is displaying this but I need to check uh basically what this

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520
need to check uh basically what this

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.350
need to check uh basically what this template is displaying and from where

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360
template is displaying and from where

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.629
template is displaying and from where it's taking the data. I thought for some

01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639
it's taking the data. I thought for some

01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:41.430
it's taking the data. I thought for some moment that maybe if there is one result

01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440
moment that maybe if there is one result

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.430
moment that maybe if there is one result result it's

01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440
result it's

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.910
result it's uh showing something but that's actually

01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920
uh showing something but that's actually

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.310
uh showing something but that's actually not true.

01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320
not true.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.750
not true. Okay.

01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760
Okay.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:52.390
Okay. So there is some template for sure

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400
So there is some template for sure

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.790
So there is some template for sure behind this. I would need to check it.

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800
behind this. I would need to check it.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.830
behind this. I would need to check it. Yeah. Another thing

01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840
Yeah. Another thing

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.629
Yeah. Another thing I never I never wondered about this

01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639
I never I never wondered about this

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.149
I never I never wondered about this part.

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159
part.

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:01.910
part. Another thing I noticed is that if you

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920
Another thing I noticed is that if you

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.870
Another thing I noticed is that if you type official it doesn't show unofficial

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880
type official it doesn't show unofficial

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.189
type official it doesn't show unofficial as a result which is weird. So, it's not

01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199
as a result which is weird. So, it's not

01:33:07.199 --> 01:33:08.629
as a result which is weird. So, it's not doing like a full text search. It's

01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639
doing like a full text search. It's

01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:12.470
doing like a full text search. It's doing some sort of like front search or

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480
doing some sort of like front search or

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.750
doing some sort of like front search or something.

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760
something.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.470
something. Uh, it's it's not uh added to all text.

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480
Uh, it's it's not uh added to all text.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:18.870
Uh, it's it's not uh added to all text. Okay.

01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880
Okay.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.550
Okay. By default.

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560
By default.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.669
By default. So, it will not uh search for parts of

01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679
So, it will not uh search for parts of

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:24.629
So, it will not uh search for parts of it.

01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639
it.

01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:25.590
it. Okay. So, you have to

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600
Okay. So, you have to

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.590
Okay. So, you have to it will only search from the beginning.

01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600
it will only search from the beginning.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.030
it will only search from the beginning. Right. So, um

01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040
Right. So, um

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.550
Right. So, um Okay. So, I'd have to do something to

01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560
Okay. So, I'd have to do something to

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:36.709
Okay. So, I'd have to do something to get it to be full text.

01:33:36.719 --> 01:33:39.350
Mhm. For the full text, I will need to

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360
Mhm. For the full text, I will need to

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.629
Mhm. For the full text, I will need to find this is called all text.

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639
find this is called all text.

01:33:42.639 --> 01:33:44.390
find this is called all text. Yeah, there was like a field or what was

01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400
Yeah, there was like a field or what was

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.750
Yeah, there was like a field or what was it?

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760
it?

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.830
it? I tried adding that and it yelled at me.

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840
I tried adding that and it yelled at me.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.149
I tried adding that and it yelled at me. It was like target full text and it told

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159
It was like target full text and it told

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:54.390
It was like target full text and it told me it didn't know what that is.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:59.750
So for the storefront uh search

01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760
So for the storefront uh search

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.790
So for the storefront uh search we do have all text and we have a lot of

01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800
we do have all text and we have a lot of

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.750
we do have all text and we have a lot of options for the storefront. For back

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760
options for the storefront. For back

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.229
options for the storefront. For back office

01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239
office

01:34:08.239 --> 01:34:10.950
office that's not the common case to do

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960
that's not the common case to do

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.350
that's not the common case to do anything custom to the search engine to

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360
anything custom to the search engine to

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.629
anything custom to the search engine to be honest.

01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639
be honest.

01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:15.270
be honest. Okay.

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280
Okay.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:26.070
Okay. Uh so there because normally for the

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.430
I guess all I was trying to do was get

01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440
I guess all I was trying to do was get

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.510
I guess all I was trying to do was get to the point where my search results

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520
to the point where my search results

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.550
to the point where my search results looked like searching for like users.

01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560
looked like searching for like users.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.030
looked like searching for like users. Like when I search for a user and show

01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040
Like when I search for a user and show

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.709
Like when I search for a user and show me just my second look. I'm curious.

01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719
me just my second look. I'm curious.

01:34:38.719 --> 01:34:40.629
me just my second look. I'm curious. Yeah. One second. I'll need to join from

01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639
Yeah. One second. I'll need to join from

01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:43.910
Yeah. One second. I'll need to join from my I've got a two computers set up. So

01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920
my I've got a two computers set up. So

01:34:43.920 --> 01:35:00.320
my I've got a two computers set up. So yeah, sure.

01:35:00.330 --> 01:35:01.830
[Music]

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.189
and it shows me this. Oh,

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199
Oh,

01:35:31.199 --> 01:35:32.149
Oh, that's nice.

01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159
that's nice.

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:33.750
that's nice. Yeah. And it also doesn't show like

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760
Yeah. And it also doesn't show like

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.430
Yeah. And it also doesn't show like unofficial. So, kind of two separate

01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440
unofficial. So, kind of two separate

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.950
unofficial. So, kind of two separate things that I'm trying to figure out is

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960
things that I'm trying to figure out is

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.110
things that I'm trying to figure out is how do I get that to look better? And

01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120
how do I get that to look better? And

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.270
how do I get that to look better? And two, how would I get unofficial to show

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280
two, how would I get unofficial to show

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.430
two, how would I get unofficial to show up in addition to official? Otherwise,

01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440
up in addition to official? Otherwise,

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.590
up in addition to official? Otherwise, the search isn't very useful. all text

01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600
the search isn't very useful. all text

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.470
the search isn't very useful. all text for back office. I can show you how to

01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480
for back office. I can show you how to

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.709
for back office. I can show you how to uh for the storefront

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719
uh for the storefront

01:35:50.719 --> 01:35:53.590
uh for the storefront uh how to define that some particular

01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600
uh how to define that some particular

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.229
uh how to define that some particular value should go go to the old text and

01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239
value should go go to the old text and

01:35:56.239 --> 01:35:58.390
value should go go to the old text and you'll be able to search by it.

01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400
you'll be able to search by it.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:58.790
you'll be able to search by it. Okay,

01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800
Okay,

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.350
Okay, I'm not sure if it's uh I would need to

01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360
I'm not sure if it's uh I would need to

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.830
I'm not sure if it's uh I would need to check documentation if we even support

01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840
check documentation if we even support

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.149
check documentation if we even support all text somehow and how to configure

01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159
all text somehow and how to configure

01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:06.550
all text somehow and how to configure it.

01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560
it.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.750
it. Doesn't actually work for that

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760
Doesn't actually work for that

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.310
Doesn't actually work for that to be honest. I never did that. So I'd

01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320
to be honest. I never did that. So I'd

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.390
to be honest. I never did that. So I'd need to check documentation.

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400
need to check documentation.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.910
need to check documentation. It is interesting for like the account

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920
It is interesting for like the account

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.229
It is interesting for like the account one it does match but that might just be

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239
one it does match but that might just be

01:36:16.239 --> 01:36:18.790
one it does match but that might just be because we're indexing some value with

01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800
because we're indexing some value with

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.030
because we're indexing some value with this word but you can tell like it

01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040
this word but you can tell like it

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:21.990
this word but you can tell like it doesn't

01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000
doesn't

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.470
doesn't probably indexing a lot of values and

01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480
probably indexing a lot of values and

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.110
probably indexing a lot of values and somewhere there there is a job.

01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120
somewhere there there is a job.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:27.590
somewhere there there is a job. Yeah.

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600
Yeah.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.229
Yeah. Um

01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239
Um

01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:29.910
Um that exact word. Yeah.

01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920
that exact word. Yeah.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.790
that exact word. Yeah. Show me again the

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800
Show me again the

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.950
Show me again the uh official

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.390
first name last name suffix.

01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400
first name last name suffix.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.430
first name last name suffix. So that's my format. It comes from your

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440
So that's my format. It comes from your

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.270
So that's my format. It comes from your uh listener the decorator for the name.

01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280
uh listener the decorator for the name.

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.669
uh listener the decorator for the name. This that's those strings are my format.

01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679
This that's those strings are my format.

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:52.709
This that's those strings are my format. So I I use this is my format spec. So

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719
So I I use this is my format spec. So

01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:54.149
So I I use this is my format spec. So like that's my format value.

01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159
like that's my format value.

01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:55.109
like that's my format value. Okay.

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119
Okay.

01:36:55.119 --> 01:36:56.950
Okay. But it's it's like taking the title and

01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960
But it's it's like taking the title and

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.590
But it's it's like taking the title and the format and creating the

01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600
the format and creating the

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.990
the format and creating the um you know in the

01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000
um you know in the

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.830
um you know in the it did this to by oh let me go to actual

01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840
it did this to by oh let me go to actual

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:13.030
it did this to by oh let me go to actual search. Sorry.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.270
So we search for that. It does the same

01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280
So we search for that. It does the same

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.470
So we search for that. It does the same thing here.

01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480
thing here.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.750
thing here. Title format above this

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.830
and I don't

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.830
I can bring over my code real quick. So

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840
I can bring over my code real quick. So

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.149
I can bring over my code real quick. So like this selected data.name

01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159
like this selected data.name

01:37:32.159 --> 01:37:35.590
like this selected data.name ends up being title and format

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600
ends up being title and format

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.669
ends up being title and format concatenated together for some reason.

01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679
concatenated together for some reason.

01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:40.229
concatenated together for some reason. Like nowhere did I tell it to index

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239
Like nowhere did I tell it to index

01:37:40.239 --> 01:37:43.109
Like nowhere did I tell it to index format. It just sort of decided it was

01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119
format. It just sort of decided it was

01:37:43.119 --> 01:37:44.070
format. It just sort of decided it was going to.

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080
going to.

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.149
going to. Can you switch back to this title?

01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159
Can you switch back to this title?

01:37:48.159 --> 01:37:52.550
Can you switch back to this title? So it's selected data name.

01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560
So it's selected data name.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.950
So it's selected data name. Okay. But we don't have a name on our

01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960
Okay. But we don't have a name on our

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.229
Okay. But we don't have a name on our entity.

01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239
entity.

01:37:56.239 --> 01:37:56.790
entity. Okay.

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800
Okay.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.149
Okay. So it's trying to build

01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159
So it's trying to build

01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:02.229
So it's trying to build this.

01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239
this.

01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:04.870
this. So it's probably

01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880
So it's probably

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.669
So it's probably uh Okay. It's trying to build a name. So

01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679
uh Okay. It's trying to build a name. So

01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:10.470
uh Okay. It's trying to build a name. So it's actually using this entity name

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480
it's actually using this entity name

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.229
it's actually using this entity name provider. You remember from the first

01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239
provider. You remember from the first

01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.950
provider. You remember from the first practice the one that we decorated

01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960
practice the one that we decorated

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.629
practice the one that we decorated the entity name provider

01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639
the entity name provider

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:19.430
the entity name provider and this entity if you use a name and

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440
and this entity if you use a name and

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.430
and this entity if you use a name and not display a value like we have title

01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440
not display a value like we have title

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.510
not display a value like we have title and format. So if you just put their

01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520
and format. So if you just put their

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.629
and format. So if you just put their title it will be displaying you only

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639
title it will be displaying you only

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:29.109
title it will be displaying you only title. You displayed a name. So you kind

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119
title. You displayed a name. So you kind

01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:32.149
title. You displayed a name. So you kind of executed our entity name provider and

01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159
of executed our entity name provider and

01:38:32.159 --> 01:38:34.709
of executed our entity name provider and our entity name provider um

01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719
our entity name provider um

01:38:34.719 --> 01:38:36.550
our entity name provider um expects data

01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560
expects data

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.629
expects data will uh return you

01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639
will uh return you

01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:44.550
will uh return you uh

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.629
will return you by default

01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639
will return you by default

01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:50.709
will return you by default and that may just be a matter of how I

01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719
and that may just be a matter of how I

01:38:50.719 --> 01:38:53.430
and that may just be a matter of how I implemented mine. So I did it a little

01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440
implemented mine. So I did it a little

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.990
implemented mine. So I did it a little differently. Can you show me yes your

01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000
differently. Can you show me yes your

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.470
differently. Can you show me yes your provider but uh you changed it only for

01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480
provider but uh you changed it only for

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.030
provider but uh you changed it only for the user entity. So for the usernaming

01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040
the user entity. So for the usernaming

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.270
the user entity. So for the usernaming type it's actually calling the original

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280
type it's actually calling the original

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.109
type it's actually calling the original provider and

01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119
provider and

01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:07.430
provider and uh original name provider also has some

01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440
uh original name provider also has some

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.750
uh original name provider also has some rules inside how to display name. If you

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760
rules inside how to display name. If you

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.629
rules inside how to display name. If you can enter it so we can check it.

01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639
can enter it so we can check it.

01:39:12.639 --> 01:39:14.229
can enter it so we can check it. Go there.

01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239
Go there.

01:39:14.239 --> 01:39:16.790
Go there. Oh sorry that goes to the wrong place.

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800
Oh sorry that goes to the wrong place.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.430
Oh sorry that goes to the wrong place. Getting name.

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440
Getting name.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.109
Getting name. One second. I have to find it because

01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119
One second. I have to find it because

01:39:21.119 --> 01:39:23.430
One second. I have to find it because it's not control clicking doesn't work.

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440
it's not control clicking doesn't work.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.270
it's not control clicking doesn't work. It just thinks it's

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280
It just thinks it's

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.350
It just thinks it's uh the fastest way will be to go to the

01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360
uh the fastest way will be to go to the

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.669
uh the fastest way will be to go to the definition of your decorator in surfaces

01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679
definition of your decorator in surfaces

01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:33.590
definition of your decorator in surfaces yl and h click on the decorated

01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600
yl and h click on the decorated

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.629
yl and h click on the decorated decorates something the lower this one

01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639
decorates something the lower this one

01:39:36.639 --> 01:39:38.550
decorates something the lower this one this one

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560
this one

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:45.030
this one and it's getting name from

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.189
yes

01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199
yes

01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:50.950
yes one uh displaying you title concatenated

01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960
one uh displaying you title concatenated

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.430
one uh displaying you title concatenated with format. Mhm.

01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440
with format. Mhm.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.229
with format. Mhm. Okay. So it's it's because like if I

01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239
Okay. So it's it's because like if I

01:39:58.239 --> 01:39:59.750
Okay. So it's it's because like if I wanted to have a different name, I would

01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760
wanted to have a different name, I would

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.070
wanted to have a different name, I would need to provide a name provider override

01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080
need to provide a name provider override

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.470
need to provide a name provider override or configure the name provider in some

01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480
or configure the name provider in some

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:04.709
or configure the name provider in some way.

01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719
way.

01:40:04.719 --> 01:40:05.189
way. Yes.

01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199
Yes.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:05.590
Yes. Okay.

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600
Okay.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.830
Okay. So by default based on some rules, this

01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840
So by default based on some rules, this

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.750
So by default based on some rules, this entity name provider is returning you

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760
entity name provider is returning you

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.350
entity name provider is returning you the name. So kind of string

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360
the name. So kind of string

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.430
the name. So kind of string representation of your entity. And

01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440
representation of your entity. And

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.990
representation of your entity. And because you used in your template name

01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000
because you used in your template name

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.629
because you used in your template name and dot format or title, it actually

01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639
and dot format or title, it actually

01:40:18.639 --> 01:40:21.590
and dot format or title, it actually executed this guy and he

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600
executed this guy and he

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.229
executed this guy and he returned you concatenated title plus

01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239
returned you concatenated title plus

01:40:24.239 --> 01:40:25.350
returned you concatenated title plus interesting.

01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360
interesting.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.990
interesting. So that was so that's very or that's

01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000
So that was so that's very or that's

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.910
So that was so that's very or that's interesting. So then that name is sort

01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920
interesting. So then that name is sort

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:31.830
interesting. So then that name is sort of the dynamic field because my entity

01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840
of the dynamic field because my entity

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.350
of the dynamic field because my entity is

01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360
is

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.270
is um

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280
um

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.950
um Yeah. Okay. So it's kind of doing some

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960
Yeah. Okay. So it's kind of doing some

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.470
Yeah. Okay. So it's kind of doing some magic.

01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480
magic.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.750
magic. Okay. And actually which magic you can

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760
Okay. And actually which magic you can

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.310
Okay. And actually which magic you can check and debug or just make or check

01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320
check and debug or just make or check

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.870
check and debug or just make or check the code of this name provider on what

01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880
the code of this name provider on what

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.590
the code of this name provider on what grounds it's actually default displaying

01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600
grounds it's actually default displaying

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.350
grounds it's actually default displaying default name right if you don't have

01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360
default name right if you don't have

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.470
default name right if you don't have anything custom.

01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480
anything custom.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.910
anything custom. Mhm. Yeah. And I'm guessing the

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920
Mhm. Yeah. And I'm guessing the

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.229
Mhm. Yeah. And I'm guessing the where was I? I'm guessing that ends up

01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239
where was I? I'm guessing that ends up

01:40:58.239 --> 01:41:00.790
where was I? I'm guessing that ends up getting used here as well. So okay. So

01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800
getting used here as well. So okay. So

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.149
getting used here as well. So okay. So that's interesting. So I can look at

01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159
that's interesting. So I can look at

01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:05.669
that's interesting. So I can look at that later and play with that.

01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679
that later and play with that.

01:41:05.679 --> 01:41:07.350
that later and play with that. Thank you. But actually it's really nice

01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360
Thank you. But actually it's really nice

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.750
Thank you. But actually it's really nice that you did this because this uh nicely

01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760
that you did this because this uh nicely

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.470
that you did this because this uh nicely connects to the data uh to the entity

01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480
connects to the data uh to the entity

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.270
connects to the data uh to the entity name provider that we uh had in first

01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280
name provider that we uh had in first

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.870
name provider that we uh had in first practice.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880
practice.

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.470
practice. Yeah. So it's the same kind of idea. So

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480
Yeah. So it's the same kind of idea. So

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.870
Yeah. So it's the same kind of idea. So I could do an override that way. Is

01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880
I could do an override that way. Is

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.550
I could do an override that way. Is there any like configuration based

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560
there any like configuration based

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.550
there any like configuration based method to kind of manage that or is it

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560
method to kind of manage that or is it

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.109
method to kind of manage that or is it do you have to kind of override the you

01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119
do you have to kind of override the you

01:41:27.119 --> 01:41:29.910
do you have to kind of override the you always have to override a in a provider?

01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920
always have to override a in a provider?

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.470
always have to override a in a provider? So if you want some custom thing to be

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480
So if you want some custom thing to be

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.990
So if you want some custom thing to be displayed, you need to create decorate

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000
displayed, you need to create decorate

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.310
displayed, you need to create decorate the entity name provider like we did. So

01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320
the entity name provider like we did. So

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.629
the entity name provider like we did. So here we did it for the user and you can

01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639
here we did it for the user and you can

01:41:40.639 --> 01:41:42.149
here we did it for the user and you can create another

01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159
create another

01:41:42.159 --> 01:41:44.790
create another uh like for instance of user naming type

01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800
uh like for instance of user naming type

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.070
uh like for instance of user naming type and do something else. Um also you can

01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080
and do something else. Um also you can

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.149
and do something else. Um also you can check the default by default what is

01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159
check the default by default what is

01:41:50.159 --> 01:41:52.149
check the default by default what is going on inside there because I think

01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159
going on inside there because I think

01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:55.270
going on inside there because I think that um it's also checking some

01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280
that um it's also checking some

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.990
that um it's also checking some interfaces if we have first name last

01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000
interfaces if we have first name last

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.990
interfaces if we have first name last name something. So it has some rules

01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000
name something. So it has some rules

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:00.870
name something. So it has some rules inside.

01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880
inside.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.430
inside. Mhm.

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440
Mhm.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:05.590
Mhm. Uh what to display where. So but yeah,

01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600
Uh what to display where. So but yeah,

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.830
Uh what to display where. So but yeah, basically if you want something custom,

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840
basically if you want something custom,

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.310
basically if you want something custom, you need to customize the code. The best

01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320
you need to customize the code. The best

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.390
you need to customize the code. The best way is to decorate our naming provider

01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400
way is to decorate our naming provider

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.430
way is to decorate our naming provider and that's it.

01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440
and that's it.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.990
and that's it. Well, this is interesting. So the

01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000
Well, this is interesting. So the

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.629
Well, this is interesting. So the contact bundle has a name provider and

01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639
contact bundle has a name provider and

01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:21.830
contact bundle has a name provider and it just returns false when it asks for

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840
it just returns false when it asks for

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.430
it just returns false when it asks for the name. I'm assuming then it'll fall

01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440
the name. I'm assuming then it'll fall

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.390
the name. I'm assuming then it'll fall back to the actual

01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400
back to the actual

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.590
back to the actual No, it's negative. So it's not if it's

01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600
No, it's negative. So it's not if it's

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.870
No, it's negative. So it's not if it's not instance of contacts then false.

01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880
not instance of contacts then false.

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.790
not instance of contacts then false. Okay. Oh, I see. Okay.

01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800
Okay. Oh, I see. Okay.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.510
Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. The other way around there is the

01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520
Yeah. The other way around there is the

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.030
Yeah. The other way around there is the exclamation mark at the beginning.

01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040
exclamation mark at the beginning.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.350
exclamation mark at the beginning. Yeah. It's hard to see. I'm on I usually

01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360
Yeah. It's hard to see. I'm on I usually

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.350
Yeah. It's hard to see. I'm on I usually have it on my other screens a little bit

01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360
have it on my other screens a little bit

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.750
have it on my other screens a little bit brighter. So

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760
brighter. So

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.149
brighter. So yeah.

01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159
yeah.

01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:46.550
yeah. Okay. Uh I think I'm good for now. I can

01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560
Okay. Uh I think I'm good for now. I can

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.910
Okay. Uh I think I'm good for now. I can mess around with that more later

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920
mess around with that more later

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.910
mess around with that more later possibly. I just was trying to figure

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920
possibly. I just was trying to figure

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.669
possibly. I just was trying to figure out like where's it getting this name

01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679
out like where's it getting this name

01:42:51.679 --> 01:42:53.430
out like where's it getting this name from and how's that all connected. But

01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440
from and how's that all connected. But

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.629
from and how's that all connected. But that makes sense.

01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639
that makes sense.

01:42:54.639 --> 01:42:58.070
that makes sense. Yeah. At first I didn't notice that you

01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080
Yeah. At first I didn't notice that you

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.229
Yeah. At first I didn't notice that you use name and I also was wondering what's

01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239
use name and I also was wondering what's

01:43:00.239 --> 01:43:02.310
use name and I also was wondering what's going on there but showed me your

01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320
going on there but showed me your

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.709
going on there but showed me your template and it became more clear.

01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719
template and it became more clear.

01:43:04.719 --> 01:43:06.550
template and it became more clear. Yeah, the template was easy. I could

01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560
Yeah, the template was easy. I could

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.990
Yeah, the template was easy. I could override this and that was fine. But

01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000
override this and that was fine. But

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.070
override this and that was fine. But then I was like well wait I can't

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080
then I was like well wait I can't

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.709
then I was like well wait I can't I can't fix this. So I think you know if

01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719
I can't fix this. So I think you know if

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:14.149
I can't fix this. So I think you know if we're trying to make both the same

01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159
we're trying to make both the same

01:43:14.159 --> 01:43:15.830
we're trying to make both the same having the name provider would be the

01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840
having the name provider would be the

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.590
having the name provider would be the better option and then just have this

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600
better option and then just have this

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.310
better option and then just have this show name that way they stay in sync. Um

01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320
show name that way they stay in sync. Um

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.990
show name that way they stay in sync. Um but otherwise this is all correct here.

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000
but otherwise this is all correct here.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.070
but otherwise this is all correct here. Mhm.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.910
Okay. So, I'm going to share my screen

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920
Okay. So, I'm going to share my screen

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:41.109
Okay. So, I'm going to share my screen back and show you the tweak extension.

01:43:41.119 --> 01:43:53.910
Entire screen.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.149
Okay.

01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159
Okay.

01:43:56.159 --> 01:44:01.189
Okay. Um

01:44:01.199 --> 01:44:03.030
yeah. So that was the interesting part

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040
yeah. So that was the interesting part

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.870
yeah. So that was the interesting part and actually something connected with

01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880
and actually something connected with

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.109
and actually something connected with our functionalities. Uh so yeah now

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119
our functionalities. Uh so yeah now

01:44:09.119 --> 01:44:11.669
our functionalities. Uh so yeah now basically the last element it's uh tweak

01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679
basically the last element it's uh tweak

01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:18.229
basically the last element it's uh tweak extension. Uh so nothing connected to

01:44:18.239 --> 01:44:22.870
um Oro. Uh but so tweak extension allows

01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880
um Oro. Uh but so tweak extension allows

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.750
um Oro. Uh but so tweak extension allows you to then later in HTML tweak files

01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760
you to then later in HTML tweak files

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:32.229
you to then later in HTML tweak files like here on the view. Uh this is the

01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239
like here on the view. Uh this is the

01:44:32.239 --> 01:44:34.229
like here on the view. Uh this is the tweak filter.

01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239
tweak filter.

01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:37.270
tweak filter. Um

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.870
actually I have only filter here.

01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880
actually I have only filter here.

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.189
actually I have only filter here. function will be just you know the

01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199
function will be just you know the

01:44:43.199 --> 01:44:45.430
function will be just you know the method name and bracket bracket and we

01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440
method name and bracket bracket and we

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.550
method name and bracket bracket and we will part pass this value inside

01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560
will part pass this value inside

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.590
will part pass this value inside brackets and not like before the pipe.

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600
brackets and not like before the pipe.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.750
brackets and not like before the pipe. So that's the only difference. So if

01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760
So that's the only difference. So if

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.390
So that's the only difference. So if you'd like to have here

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400
you'd like to have here

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.669
you'd like to have here um some additional filter that doesn't

01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679
um some additional filter that doesn't

01:44:59.679 --> 01:45:02.709
um some additional filter that doesn't exist here and this is actually uh what

01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719
exist here and this is actually uh what

01:45:02.719 --> 01:45:05.350
exist here and this is actually uh what this task tells us to do to create some

01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360
this task tells us to do to create some

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.950
this task tells us to do to create some custom function or filter uh that will

01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960
custom function or filter uh that will

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.590
custom function or filter uh that will will be able later to use in HTML tweak

01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600
will be able later to use in HTML tweak

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.189
will be able later to use in HTML tweak files

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199
files

01:45:13.199 --> 01:45:16.229
files and uh this will render example of

01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239
and uh this will render example of

01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:20.229
and uh this will render example of username based on format. Okay. So if I

01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239
username based on format. Okay. So if I

01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:24.070
username based on format. Okay. So if I will be on the

01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080
will be on the

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:31.270
will be on the Oh my god. Maybe I will close few tabs.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.870
Um

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880
Um

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.870
Um if I am on the view page here, I want to

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880
if I am on the view page here, I want to

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:39.109
if I am on the view page here, I want to based on the format and my format is

01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119
based on the format and my format is

01:45:39.119 --> 01:45:42.629
based on the format and my format is this. I want to uh display some dummy

01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639
this. I want to uh display some dummy

01:45:42.639 --> 01:45:45.910
this. I want to uh display some dummy example value based on this format. So

01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920
example value based on this format. So

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.550
example value based on this format. So here we have some dummy example based on

01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560
here we have some dummy example based on

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.189
here we have some dummy example based on this format for the unofficial because

01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199
this format for the unofficial because

01:45:51.199 --> 01:45:53.270
this format for the unofficial because it's first last we're going to have this

01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280
it's first last we're going to have this

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.870
it's first last we're going to have this as an example and this is basically done

01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880
as an example and this is basically done

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.910
as an example and this is basically done uh with a tweak in our case we created a

01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920
uh with a tweak in our case we created a

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.990
uh with a tweak in our case we created a filter.

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000
filter.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.990
filter. So how to create this tweak extension?

01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000
So how to create this tweak extension?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.590
So how to create this tweak extension? We need to create a PHP sorry guys PHP

01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600
We need to create a PHP sorry guys PHP

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.350
We need to create a PHP sorry guys PHP class

01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360
class

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.910
class and that will extend tweak abstract

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920
and that will extend tweak abstract

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.590
and that will extend tweak abstract extension

01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600
extension

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.629
extension and uh I think that on the slide we have

01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639
and uh I think that on the slide we have

01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:22.149
and uh I think that on the slide we have a link to yes to the documentation from

01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159
a link to yes to the documentation from

01:46:22.159 --> 01:46:24.790
a link to yes to the documentation from the symfony because that's not oral part

01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800
the symfony because that's not oral part

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.990
the symfony because that's not oral part how to create this extensions uh how to

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000
how to create this extensions uh how to

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.550
how to create this extensions uh how to register filter how to register function

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560
register filter how to register function

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.510
register filter how to register function and how to implement all this uh so in

01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520
and how to implement all this uh so in

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.270
and how to implement all this uh so in case you need for future reference or

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280
case you need for future reference or

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.629
case you need for future reference or just want to double check in the

01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639
just want to double check in the

01:46:36.639 --> 01:46:39.350
just want to double check in the documentation. Uh this is how you

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360
documentation. Uh this is how you

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.790
documentation. Uh this is how you basically create a class register filter

01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800
basically create a class register filter

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.070
basically create a class register filter uh put implement what's this filter is

01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080
uh put implement what's this filter is

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.950
uh put implement what's this filter is supposed to do and then call this filter

01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960
supposed to do and then call this filter

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.669
supposed to do and then call this filter here and this is exactly what we're

01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679
here and this is exactly what we're

01:46:53.679 --> 01:46:58.070
here and this is exactly what we're going to do. uh we are

01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080
going to do. uh we are

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.870
going to do. uh we are going to create this extension then

01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880
going to create this extension then

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.510
going to create this extension then register a filter called full name

01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520
register a filter called full name

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.229
register a filter called full name example by this name we'll be a able

01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239
example by this name we'll be a able

01:47:06.239 --> 01:47:08.629
example by this name we'll be a able later to use this filter in our tweak

01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639
later to use this filter in our tweak

01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:11.430
later to use this filter in our tweak templates okay whenever you execute this

01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440
templates okay whenever you execute this

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.070
templates okay whenever you execute this filter in tweak template it will do

01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080
filter in tweak template it will do

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.790
filter in tweak template it will do something and this something you need to

01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800
something and this something you need to

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.189
something and this something you need to specify in the PHP code here uh so this

01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199
specify in the PHP code here uh so this

01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:24.870
specify in the PHP code here uh so this is like the binding always uh works

01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880
is like the binding always uh works

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.590
is like the binding always uh works First you pass the name and this is the

01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600
First you pass the name and this is the

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.430
First you pass the name and this is the name of the method that will be actually

01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440
name of the method that will be actually

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.229
name of the method that will be actually executed and here is its implementation.

01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239
executed and here is its implementation.

01:47:32.239 --> 01:47:34.550
executed and here is its implementation. So what we are doing we are creating

01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560
So what we are doing we are creating

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.790
So what we are doing we are creating some dummy user because this is supposed

01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800
some dummy user because this is supposed

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.350
some dummy user because this is supposed to be an example. So we're just creating

01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360
to be an example. So we're just creating

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:42.310
to be an example. So we're just creating some dummy user and filling it with some

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320
some dummy user and filling it with some

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:46.149
some dummy user and filling it with some dummy data and then based on those this

01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159
dummy data and then based on those this

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:51.030
dummy data and then based on those this user we are and based on the format

01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040
user we are and based on the format

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.709
user we are and based on the format uh we are returning example in uh second

01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719
uh we are returning example in uh second

01:47:56.719 --> 01:48:01.590
uh we are returning example in uh second uh practice or in one of those

01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600
uh practice or in one of those

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.830
uh practice or in one of those um we created just a separate service

01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840
um we created just a separate service

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.629
um we created just a separate service that has this one method where you pass

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639
that has this one method where you pass

01:48:08.639 --> 01:48:12.390
that has this one method where you pass a user pass format and it's actually

01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400
a user pass format and it's actually

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.070
a user pass format and it's actually just using strr to replace occurrences

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080
just using strr to replace occurrences

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:19.430
just using strr to replace occurrences of those elements with the real values.

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440
of those elements with the real values.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.910
of those elements with the real values. Right? So we're basically just reusing

01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920
Right? So we're basically just reusing

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.229
Right? So we're basically just reusing this method

01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239
this method

01:48:24.239 --> 01:48:26.870
this method and that's why my tweak extension also

01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880
and that's why my tweak extension also

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.470
and that's why my tweak extension also has constructor and first and only

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480
has constructor and first and only

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.390
has constructor and first and only element of our constructor is actually

01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400
element of our constructor is actually

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.030
element of our constructor is actually the service. So we're injecting

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040
the service. So we're injecting

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.070
the service. So we're injecting this guy to be able to use this uh

01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080
this guy to be able to use this uh

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.470
this guy to be able to use this uh method

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480
method

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.470
method and we are using this method. First

01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480
and we are using this method. First

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.790
and we are using this method. First parameter is our user dummy one with

01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800
parameter is our user dummy one with

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.390
parameter is our user dummy one with dummy data and second parameter

01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400
dummy data and second parameter

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.629
dummy data and second parameter uh is the format and this is the

01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639
uh is the format and this is the

01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:52.790
uh is the format and this is the variable that we will use this filter

01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800
variable that we will use this filter

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.350
variable that we will use this filter on. Okay. So now in my view template

01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360
on. Okay. So now in my view template

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.390
on. Okay. So now in my view template here we have a title and format and I'm

01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400
here we have a title and format and I'm

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.750
here we have a title and format and I'm actually going to uh display the third

01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760
actually going to uh display the third

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.870
actually going to uh display the third line uh which is going to be the name

01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880
line uh which is going to be the name

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.109
line uh which is going to be the name example. So as you can see we are using

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119
example. So as you can see we are using

01:49:09.119 --> 01:49:12.870
example. So as you can see we are using this filter on top of the format. So

01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880
this filter on top of the format. So

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.669
this filter on top of the format. So this format variable then pipe and

01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679
this format variable then pipe and

01:49:15.679 --> 01:49:18.709
this format variable then pipe and filter name. This filter name gets the

01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719
filter name. This filter name gets the

01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:20.950
filter name. This filter name gets the format.

01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960
format.

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.149
format. It goes to our extension. it executes

01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159
It goes to our extension. it executes

01:49:24.159 --> 01:49:28.870
It goes to our extension. it executes this method and the format

01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880
this method and the format

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:35.990
this method and the format from here. Okay. And it basically return

01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000
from here. Okay. And it basically return

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.310
from here. Okay. And it basically return value based on our format. And that's

01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320
value based on our format. And that's

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.470
value based on our format. And that's that's basically all right. So we

01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480
that's basically all right. So we

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:45.750
that's basically all right. So we created this filter and uh the example

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760
created this filter and uh the example

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.950
created this filter and uh the example from the view page.

01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960
from the view page.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.390
from the view page. Uh so on the user naming type view page.

01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400
Uh so on the user naming type view page.

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.990
Uh so on the user naming type view page. This is what I'm actually showing you

01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000
This is what I'm actually showing you

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.750
This is what I'm actually showing you right now. So this is this name example

01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760
right now. So this is this name example

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:03.189
right now. So this is this name example that is displayed based on our format

01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199
that is displayed based on our format

01:50:03.199 --> 01:50:05.910
that is displayed based on our format and this is on the view page right. So

01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920
and this is on the view page right. So

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:08.950
and this is on the view page right. So on top of format we are executing this

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960
on top of format we are executing this

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:17.669
on top of format we are executing this filter to display it. uh for the

01:50:17.679 --> 01:50:20.950
format column in the user naming type

01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960
format column in the user naming type

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.990
format column in the user naming type data grid. So we have usern naming type

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000
data grid. So we have usern naming type

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.350
data grid. So we have usern naming type data grid format column you we have

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360
data grid format column you we have

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.510
data grid format column you we have already this created this as a custom

01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520
already this created this as a custom

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.669
already this created this as a custom tweak template and we're displaying this

01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679
tweak template and we're displaying this

01:50:31.679 --> 01:50:34.870
tweak template and we're displaying this part and now below this part I will also

01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880
part and now below this part I will also

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.030
part and now below this part I will also display the example.

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040
display the example.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.390
display the example. So I'm going to edit my data grid column

01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400
So I'm going to edit my data grid column

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:43.109
So I'm going to edit my data grid column HTML tweak and this is what we had

01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119
HTML tweak and this is what we had

01:50:43.119 --> 01:50:45.590
HTML tweak and this is what we had previously. And now additionally I'm

01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600
previously. And now additionally I'm

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.550
previously. And now additionally I'm just basically displaying example value.

01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560
just basically displaying example value.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.390
just basically displaying example value. This is my format because we are in the

01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400
This is my format because we are in the

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.189
This is my format because we are in the format cell and we are applying this

01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199
format cell and we are applying this

01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:58.070
format cell and we are applying this filter on top of it.

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:01.990
So we get this as a result.

01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000
So we get this as a result.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.750
So we get this as a result. And the third place was to display it at

01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760
And the third place was to display it at

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.790
And the third place was to display it at user view page.

01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800
user view page.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.629
user view page. Ah okay. So we had

01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639
Ah okay. So we had

01:51:12.639 --> 01:51:14.629
Ah okay. So we had this was our first practice and this was

01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639
this was our first practice and this was

01:51:14.639 --> 01:51:17.910
this was our first practice and this was actually optional part

01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920
actually optional part

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.229
actually optional part to add this part here with the listener.

01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239
to add this part here with the listener.

01:51:22.239 --> 01:51:26.470
to add this part here with the listener. We created a listener to this page and

01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480
We created a listener to this page and

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.510
We created a listener to this page and put here rendered here some template. So

01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520
put here rendered here some template. So

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.910
put here rendered here some template. So let's go to my listener.

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.950
Okay. And we are actually rendering uh

01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960
Okay. And we are actually rendering uh

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:41.189
Okay. And we are actually rendering uh this template naming data under user.

01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199
this template naming data under user.

01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:44.310
this template naming data under user. Okay. So let's edit this.

01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320
Okay. So let's edit this.

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:46.709
Okay. So let's edit this. And again in this template we had only

01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719
And again in this template we had only

01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:49.990
And again in this template we had only this part and now additionally if there

01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000
this part and now additionally if there

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.709
this part and now additionally if there is a naming type selected for my user I

01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719
is a naming type selected for my user I

01:51:52.719 --> 01:51:55.830
is a naming type selected for my user I am rendering it. And again here

01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840
am rendering it. And again here

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:58.550
am rendering it. And again here on the format

01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560
on the format

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:01.189
on the format I'm using my filter. That's why at the

01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199
I'm using my filter. That's why at the

01:52:01.199 --> 01:52:06.950
I'm using my filter. That's why at the end we have an example.

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:13.270
Okay. Was it more or less clear?

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.709
More or less.

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719
More or less.

01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:19.109
More or less. Okay. Um guys, it's 20 minutes till the

01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119
Okay. Um guys, it's 20 minutes till the

01:52:19.119 --> 01:52:21.830
Okay. Um guys, it's 20 minutes till the end. So I actually I'm going to give you

end. So I actually I'm going to give you time to uh maybe fill in if you want the

01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320
time to uh maybe fill in if you want the

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.550
time to uh maybe fill in if you want the search part.

01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560
search part.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.270
search part. And on Monday we'll start uh from the

01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280
And on Monday we'll start uh from the

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.470
And on Monday we'll start uh from the next practice.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:39.830
Okay. So yeah, I'll get back to you in

Can you repeat?

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.910
Can you repeat? We're just going to do the next exercise

01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920
We're just going to do the next exercise

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.350
We're just going to do the next exercise now.

01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360
now.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.790
now. Uh so now I'm actually I will not start

01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800
Uh so now I'm actually I will not start

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.629
Uh so now I'm actually I will not start ACL until you want to start the ACL uh

01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639
ACL until you want to start the ACL uh

01:53:04.639 --> 01:53:06.709
ACL until you want to start the ACL uh practice but it's only we have only 20

01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719
practice but it's only we have only 20

01:53:06.719 --> 01:53:10.629
practice but it's only we have only 20 minutes left. So I think we will just

01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639
minutes left. So I think we will just

01:53:10.639 --> 01:53:12.550
minutes left. So I think we will just start doing it on Monday.

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560
start doing it on Monday.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.270
start doing it on Monday. Okay.

So right now if you still don't have the

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.629
So right now if you still don't have the search working or maybe you want to just

01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639
search working or maybe you want to just

01:53:18.639 --> 01:53:21.910
search working or maybe you want to just play around with this practice

01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920
play around with this practice

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:25.350
play around with this practice finish some elements. So just please do

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360

It's up to you. I really don't want to start next next practice when we have

01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840
start next next practice when we have

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.910
start next next practice when we have only 20 minutes. Doesn't make sense.

01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920
only 20 minutes. Doesn't make sense.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.510
only 20 minutes. Doesn't make sense. Agreed. Yeah. I don't know if we need to

01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520
Agreed. Yeah. I don't know if we need to

stay on then unless anybody else has questions but um yeah I'm probably just

01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520
questions but um yeah I'm probably just

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:41.109
questions but um yeah I'm probably just going to play on with this more on my

01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119
going to play on with this more on my

01:53:41.119 --> 01:53:41.830
going to play on with this more on my own and
