And here we have those order form. So settings uh just as an example. So it will uh
[01:20:44.239 --> 01:21:29.440] enabling B2C is to have this uh options uh either enabled, disabled, checked uh either enabled, disabled, checked unchecked according to BTC website but unchecked according to BTC website but unchecked according to BTC website. by option and specifying it on your own. by option and specifying it on your own. so it will just do it automatically but so it will just do it automatically but again it will be performed specifically again it will be performed specifically for the website
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:22:07.360] uh is there a possibility website, but uh is there a possibility website, but uh is there a possibility website, but uh is there a possibility website. uh but if the role the role of the user. Uh but if the role the role of the user.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:53.679] uh six uh we have here six right uh six websites you may have six different uh themes uh per each different uh themes uh per each different uh themes uh per each individual website. the next step would be just you have them then you assign those themes to the websites you assign those themes to the websites you assign those themes to the websites using again uh configuration.
[01:22:53.679 --> 01:23:58.870] uh they will see different team actually. uh they will be seeing different team actually. uh they will be seeing different team actually. uh sorry I am configuring uh a Europe Uh sorry I am configuring uh a Europe. uh theme but let's check very quickly. uh theme but let's check very quickly. uh theme but let's check very quickly. uh theme on a global level I have a default on 
[01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:50.709] uh this is the one routing. uh this is the one routing. uh this is the one routing. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is how custom team position. uh this is a B2C for instance imagine so this is
[01:24:50.709 --> 01:25:38.639] this will be uh same website. will be under the same website. will be under the same website. will be under the same website.
[01:25:38.639 --> 01:26:21.440] website as the B2B customers because it's let's say Germany. so I have the it's let's say Germany. so it is the customers also for Germany. so it is the same website. How is it possible for B2C same website.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:27:09.590] uh users different types of users. uh users different types of users. uh users different types of users. uh users different types of users.
[01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:59.280] another separation might be different content. Again if we are be different content then we may go talking about content then we may go to the uh content management and uh to the uh content management and uh to the uh content management and uh define uh per which uh group of define uh per which we would like to content per which we would like to content per which we would like to present another. present another. And so here we have like the the Yeah. And so here
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:47.760] h to approve for B2B to approve some uh to be products uh which are in a checkout be products uh which are in a checkout. while to be approved by some manager. While to be approved by some manager. uh no need for any approval, no need for no need for any approval, no need for any approval, no need for additional steps. Again, this is uh this additional steps.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:29:35.430] uh sorry on B2B and B2C will be on separate websites correct uh will be on separate websites correct uh will be on separate websites correct uh. uh we are not recording uh to the rules Uh we are not recording uh to the rules of the training u which is not set by me of the training u which is not set by me actually.
[01:29:35.430 --> 01:30:30.639] uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is not uh this is
[01:30:30.639 --> 01:31:58.400] uh uh theme is not exposed you see that uh uh theme is not exposed. uh uh theme is not exposed. uh uh theme is not exposed.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:33:11.760] uh with the themes and layouts this one. uh with the themes and layouts this one. uh with the themes and layouts this one. so meet you in 10 minutes. Okay. guys. [Music]
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:34:07.280] uh moving includes some layout changes. theme uh would like to mention is that theme uh would like to mention is that theme uh while creating a theme it uh usually while creating a theme it uh usually should have like one parent uh theme and should have like one parent uh theme. then only those parts which are not then only those parts which are not working uh for the for the newly working uh for the for the newly working uh for the

[01:35:39.120 --> 01:36:25.360] uh theme theme uh is worth uh stating that uh theme uh it is worth uh stating that uh theme uh it is worth uh stating that uh theme uh it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs from the one we have it actually differs
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:37:42.080] team we have two uh configuration the team we have two uh configuration nodes in application nodes in application uh parameters which um in application uh parameters which are responsible for that. for the back office this is orura team while for the office this is orura team while for the office this is orura team while for the office this is orura team while for the storefront u layout storefront u layout settings they are responsible for settings they are responsible for storefront theme.

Okay. at the very end if you don't mind. Okay.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:39:44.800] uh before uh which was as customer portal uh package which was responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which is responsible for I mentioned which
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:40:35.510] uh under layouts we should have a uh folder with layouts we should have a uh folder with layouts we should have a uh folder with layouts we should have a uh folder with layouts. uh in this case we have a default theme and it is we have a default theme and it is located under uh layouts uh in a default located under uh layouts uh in a default located under uh
[01:40:35.510 --> 01:41:29.350] uh the description of the theme. then we have uh the description of the theme. then we have uh the description of the theme. then we have uh a groups u settings which says uh to which uh group of application uh to which uh group of application let's say part of application uh theme let's say part of application uh theme should be applied. So uh we have like uh should be applied. if group is
[01:41:29.350 --> 01:42:28.070] uh no groups means for the storefront uh no groups for the back office we have an icon and for the back office we have an icon and for the logo for the theme um yeah and uh either ref to live uh support for the theme enabled or not. we support for the theme enabled or not. We have a default theme theme theme theme theme yaml Okay. we have a default theme theme theme theme theme yaml Okay.
[01:42:28.070 --> 01:43:15.280] this specific default theme we have this specific default theme. uh as I mentioned theme might have some uh uh theme might have some uh uh theme might have some uh uh JavaScript components related to it.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:44:26.080] uh classes additional classes to use. And classes additional classes to use. And classes additional classes to use. And classes additional classes to use.

[01:44:26.080 --> 01:45:17.679] uh custom theme it uses as a parent theme custom theme it uses as a parent theme the default one. that's why we uh we the custom theme. that's why we uh we the custom theme. that's why we uh we the custom theme. that's why we uh we the custom theme. that's why we uh we will be using the default one.
[01:45:17.679 --> 01:46:20.560] uh so it overrides using configuration. it has like a bit different uh stylings uh has like a bit different uh stylings uh has like a bit different uh stylings uh style uh files. changes which we will go in a moment. changes which we will go in a moment.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:47:08.480] uh yeah and for defining we should have Uh yeah and for defining we should have uh so whenever we would like to uh so whenever we would like to uh so whenever we would like to uh so whenever we would like to uh.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:48:04.149] uh theme is uh theme. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you. put for you.
[01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:51.679] uh just uh tune it uh per your and uh just uh needs. otherwise, you would need to uh needs. and once you have a theme, then Okay. And once you have a theme, then Okay. And once you have a theme, then you need to enable this theme to be uh you need to enable this theme to be uh you need to enable this theme to be uh.
[01:48:51.679 --> 01:49:45.520] uh uh uh in should be uh out of the box uh uh in in your application. in your application. part I will demonstrate um as well. part I will demonstrate um as well. Okay. So we have a theme then you would Okay. So we have a theme then you would Okay. So we have a theme then you would Okay. So we have a theme then you would Okay. So we have a theme then you would need to enable it and for 
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:50:39.199] uh uh in the back office is not customized because office theme is not simply used just by this is not simply used by administrators. no need to have like administrators. no need to have like administrators. no need to have like administrators.
[01:50:39.199 --> 01:51:51.520] two themes are available for uh orcommerce application. uh what kind of enabled themes we have u available and u themes we have u available. uh the configuration actually this is uh the configuration.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:52:55.830] option number one how you can specify option number one how you can specify option number one how you can specify option number one. this is option number two. Another option is to option number two.
[01:52:55.830 --> 01:53:46.709] uh u perform these updates on different instances and uh on local instance on instances and uh on local instance on stage instance development instance on stage instance on stage instance on stage instance. you would like to have the same uh behavior uh the same settings not to set behavior uh the same settings not to set behavior uh the same settings not to set behavior uh the same settings not to set behavior uh the same settings. so the migrations are configuration. so the migrations
[01:53:46.709 --> 01:54:35.679] theme manager uh yeah main provides uh theme uh provides uh theme uh active or not active enabled act uh active or not active enabled act uh active or not active enabled act uh themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have in application it themes we have

[02:07:43.599 --> 02:08:38.560] uh this is using set option uh action. so for for using set option uh action. so for for using set option uh action.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:09:28.550] we can uh actually I can set options. we can uh actually I can set options. we can uh actually I guess it should be listed here. guess it should be listed here. what kind of options do we have?
[02:09:28.550 --> 02:10:23.750] uh we have uh possible uh block types that I mentioned. uh here is a bunch that I mentioned. uh here is a bunch of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them. for the button you might have of them
[02:10:23.750 --> 02:11:30.950] root block containing uh main some root block which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains like three which under the hood contains
[02:11:30.950 --> 02:12:25.920] um is the folder with the imports and this is um is um is actually the place uh where you uh define uh layout and blocks which you define uh layout and blocks which you would like to reuse. for instance, you would like to reuse. For instance, you would like to reuse. So you define uh in one um in the imports define uh in one um in the imports define uh in one um in the imports define uh in one um in the import
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:13:24.560] you still have this uh uh to above. you still have this uh uh to above. you still have this uh uh to above. you still have this uh uh to above. you define an imports other places. you define an imports folder and then simply reuse it just not folder and then simply reuse it just not to copy paste across different u pages to copy paste across different u pages.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:14:21.280] uh data grid uh layout definition and uh data grid uh layout definition and uh reuse it for the uh listing orders uh reuse it for the uh listing orders uh. uh in general the grid uh yeah but uh in general the grid uh yeah but uh in general the grid uh yeah but uh in general the definition and the how it should look definition and the how it should look like is defined in the import
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:15:13.760] uh the layout should be uh should route. Uh the layout should be uh should route. and here you may notice that be changed. Uh the layout should be uh should route.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:16:10.310] uh folders are named by root name uh folders which are named by root name uh folders. uh folders are named by root name uh folders which are named by root name uh folders. uh folders are named by root name uh folders which are named by root name uh folders.
[02:16:10.310 --> 02:17:56.639] I will demonstrate in a second. second. second. Okay. Okay. Now I will pick up uh the default website. Um I have enabled uh enabled uh uh dev mode. Within a dev mode we have uh dev mode. So we could be expanded collapsed. collapsed. And uh let's actually sign in. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[02:17:56.639 --> 02:19:00.389] uh we have a root named called Oro checkout front end root named called Oro checkout front end root root root. uh lets see what kind of changes uh are changes uh are changes uh are introduced for instance multiple introduced for instance multiple uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping methods. uh multiple shipping
[02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:59.760] billing shipping have several steps billing shipping shipping shipping method. so we should be on a shipping method. Oh actually shipping shipping method. Oh actually shipping method this is this one. method this is this one. so okay whenever we are on this shipping So okay whenever we are on this shipping So okay whenever we are on this shipping So okay whenever we are on this shipping uh step of the workflow plus we method uh step of the workflow plus we method uh step of the workflow plus we have uh like multi-shipping
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:51.110] so we have layouts it responsible for so we have layouts it can expand. so we have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh for the root have a layout it works uh
[02:20:51.110 --> 02:21:36.160] uh or if checkout page or to this one. uh or if checkout page or to this one. uh or if checkout page or to this one. uh or if checkout page or to this one. uh or if checkout page or to this one. uh or if checkout page or to this one.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:22:58.950] uh in a wrapper. we also saw that uh in a default theme uh. we can see the definition uh of the u of the see the definition uh of the u of the see the definition uh of the u of the block.
[02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:45.920] uh template uh is responsible for uh template uh which is responsible for uh template uh which is responsible for this block. uh this will give you the ability block. Uh this will give you the ability block.
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:24:40.560] know what to know um the ability yeah to know what to know what to know um the ability yeah to know what by what ID you would like to you can uh. uh contains some widget and it also uh contains some widget and it also uh contains some useful information u of the block the useful information u of the block the ID. so for instance, you would like to ID. So for instance, you would like to ID. So for instance, you would like to ID. So for instance,
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:25:36.000] uh theme folder means it will be applied for the uh page. it contains uh the all the pages. it contains uh the all the pages. it contains uh the definition of this top navigation uh uh block uh and the structure itself.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:26:34.880] we can define u define u layout structure. under the theme we are able to theme. under the theme we are able to theme.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:27:29.200] instance navigation you have a navigation menu which is uh quite uh navigation menu which is uh quite uh navigation menu which is uh some complex u with uh some complex u with uh some plenty of items uh uh of this navigation plenty of items uh uh of this navigation. you do not change it frequently. you do not change it frequently. you may introduce uh more quickly you may introduce uh more quickly you may introduce u
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:28:23.349] it will be cached and uh whenever user will be navigating between whenever user will be navigating between PE pages. it will not uh so the server PE pages, it will not uh so the server PE pages, it will not uh so the server will not uh each time uh process the will not uh each time uh process the layout structure, build uh fetch items layout structure, build uh fetch items layout structure, build uh fetch items layout structure
[02:28:23.349 --> 02:29:12.150] Uh and u you can define it for what particular time um this block should be particular time um this block should be cached and uh if there is a change was cached and uh if there is a change was performed. Uh for instance uh performed. Uh for instance uh performed. Uh for instance uh performed. uh for instance uh performed. uh for instance uh performed. uh for instance uh performed.
[02:29:12.150 --> 02:30:08.960] if we are talking about uh top navigation menu container. about uh top navigation menu container. about uh top navigation menu container. you would pick up this ID top So you would pick up this ID top So you would pick up this ID top So you would pick up this ID top So you would pick up this ID top and in your navigation menu container and in your layout definition would need to sorry uh layout definition would need to sorry uh where I was u to define this uh settings where I was
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:58.309] uh while uh to cache the data grid but uh uh to hash cache the data grid but uh uh have it uh vary um depending on the have it uh vary um depending on the product that is uh listed in this data product that is uh listed in this data grid. uh if we have uh if we are adding list then based on this uh tax we can refer to the c on this uh
[02:30:58.309 --> 02:31:51.920] uh the cache layout has for the particular uh particular block. particular block. particular block. particular block. and other examples how this uh this should work. there are clients which are using that and it saves u it which are using that and it saves u it which are using that and it saves some time uh while uh providing uh saves some time uh while uh providing uh saves some time uh while uh providing uh
[02:31:51.920 --> 02:32:50.399] some blocks are making too complex uh and complex uh and complex uh and blocking um for the page uh response blocking um for the page uh response then you may introduce layout cache and then you may introduce layout cache and have better performance uh for Uh okay that's it what I wanted to um Uh okay that's it what I wanted to um present related to themes and layouts. present related to themes and layouts. present related to themes and layouts.
[02:32:50.399 --> 02:33:46.960] uh and um some actions which could be performed on some actions which could be performed on a on a layout and also checking the a on a layout. plus uh each layout u might have blocks. Plus uh each layout u might have blocks.
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:34:30.640] LP PDP every layout page uh uh uh homepage PLP PDP uh uh uh uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is not uh that I um so I suppose this is

Okay, let's uh quickly check uh uh how registration process work.
[03:36:50.550 --> 03:37:54.239] if I go to uh in the back office, I have uh created a customer and customer user created a customer and customer user uh. so here is the customer user which was just created the customer user which was just created as you may notice. so confirmation uh is not confirmed. so confirmation uh is not confirmed.
[03:37:54.239 --> 03:39:08.479] uh now let's switch uh back to permissions of the uh customer users. so permissions of the customer users they permissions of the customer users they are managed by customer user role. uh let's go to the back office and I will demonstrate. and I will demonstrate.

[03:40:11.600 --> 03:41:22.710] uh the ability to use quick order to use u the ability to use quick order to use u the ability to use quick order to use u the ability to use quick order to use u the ability to use quick order to use u the ability to use quick order. if we click related to the workflows, we have like four uh four with that um we have like four uh four different levels. so level none will different levels. so level none will mean that we are not which which will mean
[03:41:22.710 --> 03:42:22.160] if I set up as a u Amanda Cole, I will see my own uh orders. the higher the higher the permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions the wider permissions is to corporate level.
[03:42:22.160 --> 03:43:37.359] Okay, this is the difference between different levels different levels and for difference with the uh with the buyer difference with the uh with the buyer difference with the uh with the buyer. here I will go to the view page. it and here I will go to the view page. it will be more Um Um so you may see what kind of entities are so you may see what kind of entities are so you may see what kind of entities are so you may see what kind of entities are so you may see what kind of entities are
[03:43:37.359 --> 03:44:40.080] administrator uh can manage administrator uh can manage administrator uh. uh can manage buyer role, uh can also manage buyer role. uh can edit uh via role edit uh via role and restrict access.
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:45:31.520] a new role is created it is called customizable. Let's created it is called customizable. Let's created it is called customizable. Let's check what kind of permission it has all uh what kind of permission it has all the same permissions but uh with the same permissions but uh with the same permissions but uh with the same permissions but uh with the same permissions but uh enter billing and enter billing and enter shipping address.

Then we will have registered uh user then we will have registered uh user then we will have registered uh user then we will have registered uh user then we will have registered uh user. check out this is mentioned before.
[03:49:33.120 --> 03:50:27.750] uh user created but with guest uh uh uh cl uh set to yes uh so it will cl uh set to yes uh so it will cl uh set to yes uh so it will have like limited uh permissions but on the mint side will the mint side will meanwhile we will have this data in place. this process from the back office. this process from the back office.
[03:50:27.750 --> 03:51:24.960] customers can have like parent remember customers can have like parent parent relationship and with that we have we child relation and with that we have we have we child relation and with that we have we can have like a subsidiary and some top level companies. uh on the other hand side the hierarchy could be organized side the hierarchy could be organized using uh groups. we combine some customers uh under certain group and customers uh under certain group and customers uh under certain group and assign this uh yeah assign assign single assign this 
[03:51:24.960 --> 03:52:38.000] uh prices will be listed listed listed uh and customer can be used to represent uh and customer can be used to represent specific scope of rock. uh customers could be organized users.
