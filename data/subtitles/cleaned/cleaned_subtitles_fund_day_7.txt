00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
For me actually for the same steps I

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120
For me actually for the same steps I

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.470
For me actually for the same steps I have stopped uh previously on the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
have stopped uh previously on the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.710
have stopped uh previously on the optional parts I have switched to the

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720
optional parts I have switched to the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.669
optional parts I have switched to the other task. So two optional things still

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679
other task. So two optional things still

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.509
other task. So two optional things still there for me.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519
there for me.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.310
there for me. Okay. So the nonoptional part is on your

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
Okay. So the nonoptional part is on your

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.510
Okay. So the nonoptional part is on your site. Okay. And you understand what's

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.550
start showing you um the optional part all the whole

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
um the optional part all the whole

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.550
um the optional part all the whole depending on your status upd.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
depending on your status upd.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.430
depending on your status upd. Okay.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.070
Hi Sandep. We're finishing the practice

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080
Hi Sandep. We're finishing the practice

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.910
Hi Sandep. We're finishing the practice for import export right now up to my 3

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
for import export right now up to my 3

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.350
for import export right now up to my 3 p.m.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.790
Exactly.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800
Exactly.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.710
Exactly. Yeah, sure.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720
Yeah, sure.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.309
Yeah, sure. So,

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319
So,

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.229
So, so how long it may take?

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239
so how long it may take?

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.910
so how long it may take? After 3 p.m. So then about 3 p.m. plus a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920
After 3 p.m. So then about 3 p.m. plus a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.390
After 3 p.m. So then about 3 p.m. plus a break. So let's say in about an hour

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400
break. So let's say in about an hour

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.710
break. So let's say in about an hour I'll start on the next uh topic about

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720
I'll start on the next uh topic about

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.149
I'll start on the next uh topic about workflows.

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159
workflows.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.070
workflows. Oh, okay. Okay.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080
Oh, okay. Okay.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.430
Oh, okay. Okay. No problem. So let me join in 1 hour

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
No problem. So let me join in 1 hour

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.309
No problem. So let me join in 1 hour then.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
then.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.190
then. Okay.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200
Okay.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.949
Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:57.110
Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah, sure.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.470
Yes. And the validation is only for

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480
Yes. And the validation is only for

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.990
Yes. And the validation is only for import.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.070
Yeah. Because when you export, you're

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080
Yeah. Because when you export, you're

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.670
Yeah. Because when you export, you're not doing anything. So you're just

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
not doing anything. So you're just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.990
not doing anything. So you're just basically exporting what's inside the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000
basically exporting what's inside the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.070
basically exporting what's inside the database. There's no need to validate

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080
database. There's no need to validate

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.589
database. There's no need to validate anything.

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599
anything.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.310
anything. I see. Okay.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
I see. Okay.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.789
I see. Okay. Uh hi Anand. will we are doing the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
Uh hi Anand. will we are doing the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.789
Uh hi Anand. will we are doing the practice actually finishing the practice

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799
practice actually finishing the practice

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.550
practice actually finishing the practice for the import export and we have a time

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
for the import export and we have a time

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.670
for the import export and we have a time up till 3 p.m. my time. So 45 more

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680
up till 3 p.m. my time. So 45 more

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.150
up till 3 p.m. my time. So 45 more minutes then I'll do the break. So in

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160
minutes then I'll do the break. So in

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.469
minutes then I'll do the break. So in about an hour from now we'll start the

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479
about an hour from now we'll start the

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.749
about an hour from now we'll start the new theory topic about workflows.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
new theory topic about workflows.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.670
new theory topic about workflows. Okay. Exactly. No issue.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680
Okay. Exactly. No issue.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.510
Okay. Exactly. No issue. Yeah.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.110
Okay guys uh can you tell me your status

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
Okay guys uh can you tell me your status

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.830
Okay guys uh can you tell me your status now? Do you have any questions? Uh

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840
now? Do you have any questions? Uh

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.830
now? Do you have any questions? Uh anything that I can help you with?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840
anything that I can help you with?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.629
anything that I can help you with? Yeah. So I was I got the required pieces

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639
Yeah. So I was I got the required pieces

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.790
Yeah. So I was I got the required pieces done and I was working on the import

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800
done and I was working on the import

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.310
done and I was working on the import template

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
template

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.230
template optional piece. I'm I'm looking at the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
optional piece. I'm I'm looking at the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.350
optional piece. I'm I'm looking at the example from the slides and the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360
example from the slides and the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.430
example from the slides and the definition is not making sense. How how

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440
definition is not making sense. How how

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.510
definition is not making sense. How how does it know to use the fixture class

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520
does it know to use the fixture class

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.950
does it know to use the fixture class when doing the data conversion? It I

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960
when doing the data conversion? It I

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.029
when doing the data conversion? It I can't find like so in the coupon example

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039
can't find like so in the coupon example

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.749
can't find like so in the coupon example it's oro promotion.imp import

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759
it's oro promotion.imp import

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.029
it's oro promotion.imp import export.template_fixture.coupon.

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.350
That's not referenced anywhere. Is there

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360
That's not referenced anywhere. Is there

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.230
That's not referenced anywhere. Is there some sort of automatic

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240
some sort of automatic

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.310
some sort of automatic magic going on that says look for

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320
magic going on that says look for

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.710
magic going on that says look for something with that service name and use

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720
something with that service name and use

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.590
something with that service name and use it as the data or use it as the fixture.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600
it as the data or use it as the fixture.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.590
it as the data or use it as the fixture. Yeah. So that's uh basically by tag.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600
Yeah. So that's uh basically by tag.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.950
Yeah. So that's uh basically by tag. Okay. So all the templates fixtures are

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
Okay. So all the templates fixtures are

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.629
Okay. So all the templates fixtures are tagged with this or import export

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639
tagged with this or import export

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.749
tagged with this or import export template fixture and then we have just

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759
template fixture and then we have just

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.029
template fixture and then we have just repository of all the fixtures available

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039
repository of all the fixtures available

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.029
repository of all the fixtures available and then basically they are picked by

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039
and then basically they are picked by

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.310
and then basically they are picked by the entity.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320
the entity.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.629
the entity. Okay. So in the fixture I have to tell

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639
Okay. So in the fixture I have to tell

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.070
Okay. So in the fixture I have to tell it I support these entities.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080
it I support these entities.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.950
it I support these entities. Yeah, basically you're just doing this

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960
Yeah, basically you're just doing this

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.350
Yeah, basically you're just doing this by uh returning appropriate entity

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360
by uh returning appropriate entity

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.909
by uh returning appropriate entity class.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919
class.

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.510
class. Uh I see this. Yeah. And later if you

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
Uh I see this. Yeah. And later if you

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.710
Uh I see this. Yeah. And later if you check the definition for the um

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720
check the definition for the um

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.590
check the definition for the um processor export template processor it

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600
processor export template processor it

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.070
processor export template processor it also has their um a tag and you specify

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080
also has their um a tag and you specify

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.710
also has their um a tag and you specify entity there. So basically it's matched

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720
entity there. So basically it's matched

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.749
entity there. So basically it's matched all

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759
all

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.469
all together. Yeah. So I can I can handle

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479
together. Yeah. So I can I can handle

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.189
together. Yeah. So I can I can handle multiple

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199
multiple

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.550
multiple like some magic inside but it's a a

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560
like some magic inside but it's a a

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.670
like some magic inside but it's a a little bit visible.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
little bit visible.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.510
little bit visible. Yeah. It's just the tagging. So like I

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
Yeah. It's just the tagging. So like I

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.950
Yeah. It's just the tagging. So like I was I was so focused on the

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960
was I was so focused on the

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.390
was I was so focused on the configuration I didn't even look at the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400
configuration I didn't even look at the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.870
configuration I didn't even look at the fixture class to see that oh it's saying

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880
fixture class to see that oh it's saying

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.670
fixture class to see that oh it's saying I my the get entity class method returns

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680
I my the get entity class method returns

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.469
I my the get entity class method returns the entity that you support.

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
the entity that you support.

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.670
the entity that you support. So, okay.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680
So, okay.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.230
So, okay. And then it knows that, okay, as it goes

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240
And then it knows that, okay, as it goes

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.510
And then it knows that, okay, as it goes through all the fixtures, if it finds

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520
through all the fixtures, if it finds

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.390
through all the fixtures, if it finds one that matches the entity type, it'll

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400
one that matches the entity type, it'll

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.589
one that matches the entity type, it'll I'm assuming run the get data method.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599
I'm assuming run the get data method.

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.469
I'm assuming run the get data method. Or I need to check exactly in the import

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479
Or I need to check exactly in the import

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.230
Or I need to check exactly in the import export bundle because there's probably

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240
export bundle because there's probably

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.589
export bundle because there's probably some uh class that keeps the collection

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599
some uh class that keeps the collection

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.830
some uh class that keeps the collection of for the template fixtures and then

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840
of for the template fixtures and then

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.430
of for the template fixtures and then you can find the logic how this is

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440
you can find the logic how this is

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.070
you can find the logic how this is selected. So, I don't know this by

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080
selected. So, I don't know this by

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.950
selected. So, I don't know this by heart.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960
heart.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.790
heart. Oh, that's fine. I just like I can see

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800
Oh, that's fine. I just like I can see

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.870
Oh, that's fine. I just like I can see now how it's linked together like how it

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880
now how it's linked together like how it

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.909
now how it's linked together like how it knows that this fixture goes with my

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919
knows that this fixture goes with my

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.909
knows that this fixture goes with my usernaming site because I'm going to

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919
usernaming site because I'm going to

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.510
usernaming site because I'm going to tell it.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520
tell it.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.150
tell it. So it just in the config there was

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160
So it just in the config there was

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.670
So it just in the config there was nothing linking it to anything else and

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680
nothing linking it to anything else and

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.350
nothing linking it to anything else and I was kind of like how is this going to

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360
I was kind of like how is this going to

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.909
I was kind of like how is this going to load? But it makes more sense now.

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.430
Jacine from my side I'm not sure. I I

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
Jacine from my side I'm not sure. I I

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.150
Jacine from my side I'm not sure. I I have created the

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160
have created the

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.309
have created the validation YAML but I'm not sure where

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319
validation YAML but I'm not sure where

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.390
validation YAML but I'm not sure where it should be registered also I have

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400
it should be registered also I have

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.629
it should be registered also I have created this

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639
created this

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.990
created this but also I'm getting the content light

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000
but also I'm getting the content light

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.710
but also I'm getting the content light didn't fail it and I not sure how to

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720
didn't fail it and I not sure how to

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.150
didn't fail it and I not sure how to test it I can share my screen to show

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160
test it I can share my screen to show

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.150
test it I can share my screen to show yeah please do I will show you uh in

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160
yeah please do I will show you uh in

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.550
yeah please do I will show you uh in this case in a moment the whole optional

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560
this case in a moment the whole optional

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.070
this case in a moment the whole optional part uh and explain it step by step

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080
part uh and explain it step by step

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.710
part uh and explain it step by step because as you all have the nonoptional

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720
because as you all have the nonoptional

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.830
because as you all have the nonoptional part ready. So

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840
part ready. So

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.950
part ready. So right so that is my validation which I

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960
right so that is my validation which I

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.029
right so that is my validation which I found I believe in the lead or something

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039
found I believe in the lead or something

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.230
found I believe in the lead or something else. So the configuration looks okay

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240
else. So the configuration looks okay

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.869
else. So the configuration looks okay but I didn't found whether it's

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879
but I didn't found whether it's

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.309
but I didn't found whether it's validation

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319
validation

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:33.350
validation it's handled by the symfony so you don't

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360
it's handled by the symfony so you don't

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.990
it's handled by the symfony so you don't need to load it or any do anything with

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000
need to load it or any do anything with

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.909
need to load it or any do anything with it. You just need to place the file and

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919
it. You just need to place the file and

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.509
it. You just need to place the file and name it correctly and Symfony actually

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519
name it correctly and Symfony actually

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.550
name it correctly and Symfony actually is handling this validation. So this is

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560
is handling this validation. So this is

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.350
is handling this validation. So this is nothing custom to for to or anything

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360
nothing custom to for to or anything

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.470
nothing custom to for to or anything that's uh symfony file and basically

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480
that's uh symfony file and basically

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.550
that's uh symfony file and basically yeah some Symfony component probably

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560
yeah some Symfony component probably

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.470
yeah some Symfony component probably validation component is responsible for

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480
validation component is responsible for

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.630
validation component is responsible for loading those files. You don't need to

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640
loading those files. You don't need to

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.230
loading those files. You don't need to add them anywhere.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240
add them anywhere.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.670
add them anywhere. Okay. So it should work for this class

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680
Okay. So it should work for this class

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.870
Okay. So it should work for this class entity actually if if I'm have it.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880
entity actually if if I'm have it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.670
entity actually if if I'm have it. Mhm. So now when you try to import uh

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680
Mhm. So now when you try to import uh

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.310
Mhm. So now when you try to import uh usernaming types and for example specify

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320
usernaming types and for example specify

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.790
usernaming types and for example specify title blank then you should get an error

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800
title blank then you should get an error

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.750
title blank then you should get an error and this uh row will not be imported.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760
and this uh row will not be imported.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.269
and this uh row will not be imported. Okay. So the next step I did there

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279
Okay. So the next step I did there

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.750
Okay. So the next step I did there actually it was there previously. So I

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760
actually it was there previously. So I

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.389
actually it was there previously. So I did added this service is this actually

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399
did added this service is this actually

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.310
did added this service is this actually there is probably there is a wrong name.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320
there is probably there is a wrong name.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:42.550
there is probably there is a wrong name. Um,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.550
it's correct.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.750
That's fine. Uh, and there is the

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760
That's fine. Uh, and there is the

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:59.829
That's fine. Uh, and there is the picture.

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.990
Mhm.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000
Mhm.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.670
Mhm. from in my case it it was like showing

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680
from in my case it it was like showing

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.190
from in my case it it was like showing me

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200
me

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.949
me this.

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959
this.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:17.110
this. Mhm. So probably there's some error

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.190
and we can check actually what error in

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200
and we can check actually what error in

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.310
and we can check actually what error in if it it will not load I will ask you to

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320
if it it will not load I will ask you to

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.470
if it it will not load I will ask you to execute one command so we can check what

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480
execute one command so we can check what

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.350
execute one command so we can check what the error is

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360
the error is

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.230
the error is because there will be in logs

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240
because there will be in logs

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.230
because there will be in logs and logs are in v logs.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240
and logs are in v logs.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.230
and logs are in v logs. So

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.030
it's

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040
it's

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.509
it's building the DA container. So it can

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519
building the DA container. So it can

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:53.030
building the DA container. So it can take a while.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.590
Okay, now it's better. So if I'll try to

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600
Okay, now it's better. So if I'll try to

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.710
Okay, now it's better. So if I'll try to click this stuff,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720
click this stuff,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.110
click this stuff, I'm getting something expected.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.710
Um okay. So did you addit export

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720
Um okay. So did you addit export

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.389
Um okay. So did you addit export template processor?

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.470
So for to create

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480
So for to create

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.069
So for to create um

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079
um

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.389
um so you have export processor, you have

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399
so you have export processor, you have

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:23.110
so you have export processor, you have import processor but you still need to

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120
import processor but you still need to

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.230
import processor but you still need to add um export template processor. An

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
add um export template processor. An

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.069
add um export template processor. An example of this processor you can find

00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079
example of this processor you can find

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:37.030
example of this processor you can find on the slides from the theory.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.990
It's uh all on the slide

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.069
on the slide about import template

00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079
on the slide about import template

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:51.750
on the slide about import template fixture.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.110
It's not this.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120
It's not this.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.710
It's not this. Uh this is uh

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.350
actually you have as the last one it's

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360
actually you have as the last one it's

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.389
actually you have as the last one it's export template processor from line 69

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399
export template processor from line 69

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:10.389
export template processor from line 69 to line 74 you've got export template

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399
to line 74 you've got export template

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:14.389
to line 74 you've got export template processor

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.790
and here you need also custom data

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800
and here you need also custom data

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.350
and here you need also custom data converter because it's fetching data not

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360
converter because it's fetching data not

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.750
converter because it's fetching data not from database but from your fixture.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760
from database but from your fixture.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.110
from database but from your fixture. Sure.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.990
Um yeah. So on this part

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.400
just fix indentation. Yeah.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.150
[Music]

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160
[Music]

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.949
[Music] Yeah. You need to create data converter.

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959
Yeah. You need to create data converter.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:46.550
Yeah. You need to create data converter. So go back to the slides uh to the code

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560
So go back to the slides uh to the code

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.190
So go back to the slides uh to the code and this data converter just has

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200
and this data converter just has

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.710
and this data converter just has different parent because parent is

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720
different parent because parent is

00:12:50.720 --> 00:13:03.350
different parent because parent is template fixture. So yeah,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.030
just change the name of the services

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.910
and pass the data converter that you

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920
and pass the data converter that you

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:27.430
and pass the data converter that you created in line 39 to your processor.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.350
No, the parent is okay. The data

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360
No, the parent is okay. The data

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.030
No, the parent is okay. The data converter needs to be set to the one

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040
converter needs to be set to the one

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.910
converter needs to be set to the one that you created.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.949
Okay.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959
Okay.

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.430
Okay. And this is the processor type export

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440
And this is the processor type export

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.590
And this is the processor type export template. Uh you still need to change

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600
template. Uh you still need to change

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.150
template. Uh you still need to change the entity

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160
the entity

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.670
the entity and

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680
and

00:13:45.680 --> 00:14:00.629
and uh give it some alias.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.430
and this alias needs to be also in your

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440
and this alias needs to be also in your

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.550
and this alias needs to be also in your configuration class. So the import

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560
configuration class. So the import

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.550
configuration class. So the import export configuration

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.030
export processor you already added that

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040
export processor you already added that

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.310
export processor you already added that okay so that's why

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320
okay so that's why

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.790
okay so that's why type

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800
type

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.550
type so that's why buttons were rendered

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560
so that's why buttons were rendered

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.150
so that's why buttons were rendered correctly but when you click the button

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160
correctly but when you click the button

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.990
correctly but when you click the button they will trying to reach this processor

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000
they will trying to reach this processor

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.629
they will trying to reach this processor and it didn't exist.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:54.710
Okay. Yes, I need to

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:01.520
check something download it.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:09.269
[Music]

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:14.870
Title

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.430
and in order to import I should use this

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440
and in order to import I should use this

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.230
and in order to import I should use this the same labeling.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240
the same labeling.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.150
the same labeling. Yeah. So, it's good to have translations

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160
Yeah. So, it's good to have translations

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.069
Yeah. So, it's good to have translations right now because by default, as you

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079
right now because by default, as you

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:28.230
right now because by default, as you basically see, uh we're using

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240
basically see, uh we're using

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:37.350
basically see, uh we're using translations here.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.670
See the messages

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680

resources translations. [Music]

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.990
Okay, but it's basically working. You

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000
Okay, but it's basically working. You

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.030
Okay, but it's basically working. You just need to play around with

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040
just need to play around with

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.949
just need to play around with translations to have different headers

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959
translations to have different headers

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:04.069
translations to have different headers or you can even define heers uh on the

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079
or you can even define heers uh on the

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:07.030
or you can even define heers uh on the entity level if you prefer this way. Uh

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040
entity level if you prefer this way. Uh

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.629
entity level if you prefer this way. Uh so that's like some additional thing,

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639
so that's like some additional thing,

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:13.590
so that's like some additional thing, right? So the question how to import and

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600
right? So the question how to import and

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.990
right? So the question how to import and if the validation is working that's the

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000
if the validation is working that's the

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.990
if the validation is working that's the question but you're saying that it's

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
question but you're saying that it's

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.069
question but you're saying that it's working so it's the only things needed

00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079
working so it's the only things needed

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.670
working so it's the only things needed is this file.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680
is this file.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.189
is this file. Mhm. Yeah. Now if you test uh import uh

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199
Mhm. Yeah. Now if you test uh import uh

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.189
Mhm. Yeah. Now if you test uh import uh then you should not be able to import

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199
then you should not be able to import

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.710
then you should not be able to import empty value.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720
empty value.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:37.110
empty value. Okay. or or a longer value than 64

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.350
format label.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.230
Okay. Uh I will take over the screen and

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240
Okay. Uh I will take over the screen and

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.069
Okay. Uh I will take over the screen and this from the scratch for everybody to

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079
this from the scratch for everybody to

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:52.230
this from the scratch for everybody to uh to be on the same page. So as you are

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240
uh to be on the same page. So as you are

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.870
uh to be on the same page. So as you are already with uh all the nonoptional

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880
already with uh all the nonoptional

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.629
already with uh all the nonoptional parts

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639
parts

00:16:56.639 --> 00:17:00.389
parts uh so you basically have import exports

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399
uh so you basically have import exports

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:06.230
uh so you basically have import exports just not with the

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.590
uh template. So that's

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600
uh template. So that's

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.669
uh template. So that's uh like fine on your side. And regarding

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679
uh like fine on your side. And regarding

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.909
uh like fine on your side. And regarding the optional parts

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919
the optional parts

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.949
the optional parts uh so first was to add a entity

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959
uh so first was to add a entity

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:20.470
uh so first was to add a entity validation

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480
validation

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.710
validation uh for title and format that they should

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720
uh for title and format that they should

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.909
uh for title and format that they should not be empty and have proper length. Uh

00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919
not be empty and have proper length. Uh

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:32.070
not be empty and have proper length. Uh so this file is inside resources config

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080
so this file is inside resources config

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.710
so this file is inside resources config here this is symfony validation. So

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720
here this is symfony validation. So

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.789
here this is symfony validation. So symfony will handle this file and apply

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799
symfony will handle this file and apply

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:41.350
symfony will handle this file and apply this validation for us. import export is

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360
this validation for us. import export is

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.430
this validation for us. import export is um is going to use this validation

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440
um is going to use this validation

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.830
um is going to use this validation because we're submitting

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840
because we're submitting

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.029
because we're submitting entities through form types and uh this

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039
entities through form types and uh this

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:52.150
entities through form types and uh this is basically it. So per entity and for

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160
is basically it. So per entity and for

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.630
is basically it. So per entity and for each property we need to specify some

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640
each property we need to specify some

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.789
each property we need to specify some constraints and this supposed to be not

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799
constraints and this supposed to be not

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:59.669
constraints and this supposed to be not blank for both and appropriate length.

00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679
blank for both and appropriate length.

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:04.150
blank for both and appropriate length. So our title was 64 our format was 255

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160
So our title was 64 our format was 255

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.390
So our title was 64 our format was 255 and when I have this you can test it. Uh

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400
and when I have this you can test it. Uh

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.590
and when I have this you can test it. Uh let me

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600
let me

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.310
let me check my consumers.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.990
Okay. So let me test something. Actually

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000
Okay. So let me test something. Actually

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.950
Okay. So let me test something. Actually I think I did export last time.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:38.150
So

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.630
That's not it.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640
That's not it.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.549
That's not it. Okay, let me do the export one more

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559
Okay, let me do the export one more

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:46.870
Okay, let me do the export one more time.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.310
Okay,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.029
so my export file

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:58.710
it's here.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.070
So let me just remove I will just add

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080
So let me just remove I will just add

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.430
So let me just remove I will just add one row

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440
one row

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.789
one row and name it

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799
and name it

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:13.350
and name it first. H actually

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360
first. H actually

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:22.230
first. H actually I want to it to be empty first.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.630
Okay,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.870
let's try to import it. Uh, that will be

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:41.510
here.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.029
Yeah, this is better.

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.470
a lot of projects

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480
a lot of projects

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.590
a lot of projects and it's here and it's

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600
and it's here and it's

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.430
and it's here and it's inside our data. I should probably do

00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440
inside our data. I should probably do

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.430
inside our data. I should probably do some shortcut

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440
some shortcut

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.470
some shortcut and modify

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480
and modify

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.590
and modify this one. Okay,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600
this one. Okay,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.789
this one. Okay, let's try to import it

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799
let's try to import it

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:14.310
let's try to import it and let's check my

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320
and let's check my

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.830
and let's check my I didn't test it before, so I hope

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840
I didn't test it before, so I hope

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.789
I didn't test it before, so I hope uh error log

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799
uh error log

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:25.430
uh error log title this value should not be blank.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440
title this value should not be blank.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.029
title this value should not be blank. Okay,

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039
Okay,

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:30.070
Okay, so it was processed and we have an

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080
so it was processed and we have an

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.470
so it was processed and we have an error.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480
error.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.390
error. Uh, okay. And then the last part was to

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400
Uh, okay. And then the last part was to

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.870
Uh, okay. And then the last part was to create import template. Uh so for this I

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880
create import template. Uh so for this I

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.110
create import template. Uh so for this I will actually follow slide. So we need

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120
will actually follow slide. So we need

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.909
will actually follow slide. So we need to create the uh template file that will

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919
to create the uh template file that will

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:48.310
to create the uh template file that will extend abstract template repository and

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320
extend abstract template repository and

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.789
extend abstract template repository and implement template fixture interface. We

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799
implement template fixture interface. We

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:53.830
implement template fixture interface. We need to register it in the

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840
need to register it in the

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.789
need to register it in the DI container with this tag. And also for

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799
DI container with this tag. And also for

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.950
DI container with this tag. And also for this we need to create this fourth

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960
this we need to create this fourth

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.029
this we need to create this fourth processor which is of type export

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039
processor which is of type export

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:04.070
processor which is of type export template. And this processor needs a

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080
template. And this processor needs a

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.110
template. And this processor needs a separate data uh converter.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120
separate data uh converter.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.430
separate data uh converter. Uh so for this we have uh first the

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440
Uh so for this we have uh first the

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.549
Uh so for this we have uh first the template picture. So this is PHP class

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559
template picture. So this is PHP class

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.789
template picture. So this is PHP class that extends

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799
that extends

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:20.149
that extends uh abstract template repository

00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159
uh abstract template repository

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:22.390
uh abstract template repository from our import export bundle and

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400
from our import export bundle and

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.630
from our import export bundle and implement temperate fixture interface.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640
implement temperate fixture interface.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.350
implement temperate fixture interface. And here we need to specify a few uh

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360
And here we need to specify a few uh

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.669
And here we need to specify a few uh elements. So the entity class that this

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679
elements. So the entity class that this

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:33.029
elements. So the entity class that this template supports uh then how to create

00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039
template supports uh then how to create

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:36.149
template supports uh then how to create your entity this is used by the parent

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159
your entity this is used by the parent

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.909
your entity this is used by the parent class

00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919
class

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:39.990
class and then in the get data method you

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000
and then in the get data method you

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.230
and then in the get data method you return exactly this one single row with

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240
return exactly this one single row with

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.270
return exactly this one single row with dummy data uh and filling this dummy

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280
dummy data uh and filling this dummy

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.470
dummy data uh and filling this dummy data is inside fill entity data. So for

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480
data is inside fill entity data. So for

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.230
data is inside fill entity data. So for this particular uh tag uh we're just

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240
this particular uh tag uh we're just

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.950
this particular uh tag uh we're just basically setting title and format to

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960
basically setting title and format to

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.630
basically setting title and format to some example one. When we have this

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640
some example one. When we have this

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.909
some example one. When we have this then we need to add it to uh the

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919
then we need to add it to uh the

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.990
then we need to add it to uh the container. So we're basically adding our

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000
container. So we're basically adding our

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.070
container. So we're basically adding our class. For me I'm using class name as a

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080
class. For me I'm using class name as a

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.710
class. For me I'm using class name as a service in this case and I need to tag

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720
service in this case and I need to tag

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.789
service in this case and I need to tag it with oro import export template

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799
it with oro import export template

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:14.310
it with oro import export template fixture. Uh for this I need to create

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320
fixture. Uh for this I need to create

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.110
fixture. Uh for this I need to create one more uh processor and this is export

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120
one more uh processor and this is export

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.270
one more uh processor and this is export template processor. So this is my

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280
template processor. So this is my

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.029
template processor. So this is my processor.

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039
processor.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.470
processor. It has a parent export processor export

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480
It has a parent export processor export

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.710
It has a parent export processor export abstract and here we need to have

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720
abstract and here we need to have

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.110
abstract and here we need to have different data converters. So we cannot

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120
different data converters. So we cannot

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.590
different data converters. So we cannot re reuse the one that we have in import

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600
re reuse the one that we have in import

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.990
re reuse the one that we have in import processor and in standard export

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000
processor and in standard export

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.549
processor and in standard export processor because this one uh is

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559
processor because this one uh is

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:40.630
processor because this one uh is actually using data from our fixture. So

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640
actually using data from our fixture. So

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.510
actually using data from our fixture. So this service was also first created and

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520
this service was also first created and

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.110
this service was also first created and the parent is a bit different. It's uh

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120
the parent is a bit different. It's uh

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.110
the parent is a bit different. It's uh data converter template fixture

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120
data converter template fixture

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.350
data converter template fixture configurable. So we created data

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360
configurable. So we created data

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.149
configurable. So we created data converter then our processor where we

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159
converter then our processor where we

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.630
converter then our processor where we need to set this data converter and this

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640
need to set this data converter and this

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.630
need to set this data converter and this processor needs to be tagged with autoo

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640
processor needs to be tagged with autoo

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.430
processor needs to be tagged with autoo import export processor type export

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440
import export processor type export

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.070
import export processor type export template. We are going to create a dummy

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080
template. We are going to create a dummy

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.870
template. We are going to create a dummy data of our username type entity and we

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880
data of our username type entity and we

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.190
data of our username type entity and we need to give it some alias and for this

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200
need to give it some alias and for this

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.630
need to give it some alias and for this button to be rendered we need to specify

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640
button to be rendered we need to specify

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.870
button to be rendered we need to specify that this processor exists in our

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880
that this processor exists in our

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.390
that this processor exists in our configuration.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400
configuration.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.029
configuration. So in my configuration file the

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039
So in my configuration file the

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:21.669
So in my configuration file the additional line is this one. So we are

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679
additional line is this one. So we are

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.909
additional line is this one. So we are specifying the export template processor

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919
specifying the export template processor

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:27.029
specifying the export template processor alias. This is why how we will get this

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039
alias. This is why how we will get this

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.950
alias. This is why how we will get this additional button and when we will click

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960
additional button and when we will click

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.750
additional button and when we will click it this processor appropriate export

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760
it this processor appropriate export

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.630
it this processor appropriate export template job will be executed with this

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640
template job will be executed with this

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.230
template job will be executed with this particular processor and we should get

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240
particular processor and we should get

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.510
particular processor and we should get uh this dummy data there.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520
uh this dummy data there.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.350
uh this dummy data there. Okay. So this file then we need to

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360
Okay. So this file then we need to

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.990
Okay. So this file then we need to register it in a DI container and tag it

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000
register it in a DI container and tag it

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.310
register it in a DI container and tag it properly.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320
properly.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.510
properly. Create export template processor

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520
Create export template processor

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.149
Create export template processor and data converter tag this processor

00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159
and data converter tag this processor

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:59.669
and data converter tag this processor properly and in our configuration file

00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679
properly and in our configuration file

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:02.230
properly and in our configuration file specify this alias to export template

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240
specify this alias to export template

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.070
specify this alias to export template processor. And with all this we have

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080
processor. And with all this we have

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.190
processor. And with all this we have this fourth button here.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200
this fourth button here.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.310
this fourth button here. And when I click it, it will download a

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320
And when I click it, it will download a

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.549
And when I click it, it will download a file with those dummy data.

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559
file with those dummy data.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.110
file with those dummy data. Okay.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120
Okay.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.590
Okay. And this is full name. And this is

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600
And this is full name. And this is

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.430
And this is full name. And this is exactly what I have in my

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440
exactly what I have in my

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.390
exactly what I have in my template fixture. So full name and

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400
template fixture. So full name and

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.950
template fixture. So full name and prefix. So this goes to this part.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960
prefix. So this goes to this part.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.630
prefix. So this goes to this part. Okay.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640
Okay.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.269
Okay. Is it more or less more clear? maybe

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279
Is it more or less more clear? maybe

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:42.390
Is it more or less more clear? maybe though.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.470
Yep. Yeah, I got mine working locally.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480
Yep. Yeah, I got mine working locally.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.269
Yep. Yeah, I got mine working locally. So,

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279
So,

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:51.029
So, and uh according to how this is checked,

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039
and uh according to how this is checked,

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.430
and uh according to how this is checked, this is exactly

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440
this is exactly

00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:00.950
this is exactly uh let's me show you the container.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.029
Okay, so we have a compiler pass. So the

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039
Okay, so we have a compiler pass. So the

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.029
Okay, so we have a compiler pass. So the service is going to be executed when the

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039
service is going to be executed when the

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:09.669
service is going to be executed when the DI container will be built. And here are

00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679
DI container will be built. And here are

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:12.549
DI container will be built. And here are here we are taking all the services

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559
here we are taking all the services

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:16.470
here we are taking all the services tagged with this tag and adding them to

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480
tagged with this tag and adding them to

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.470
tagged with this tag and adding them to our container and in this case this is

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480
our container and in this case this is

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.470
our container and in this case this is template fixture manager service that

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480
template fixture manager service that

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.510
template fixture manager service that keeps all the template fixtures there

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520
keeps all the template fixtures there

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.029
keeps all the template fixtures there and we are calling at entity repository

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039
and we are calling at entity repository

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:30.390
and we are calling at entity repository there. So let me show you the manager. I

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400
there. So let me show you the manager. I

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.830
there. So let me show you the manager. I think I have it opened here

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840
think I have it opened here

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.470
think I have it opened here and this is executing

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480
and this is executing

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.230
and this is executing add entity repository. So we're

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240
add entity repository. So we're

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.750
add entity repository. So we're basically adding this template fixture

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760
basically adding this template fixture

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.669
basically adding this template fixture to the list of template repositories

00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679
to the list of template repositories

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.669
to the list of template repositories and then whenever we're trying to fetch

00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679
and then whenever we're trying to fetch

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:52.310
and then whenever we're trying to fetch it we are first calling ensure

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320
it we are first calling ensure

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.830
it we are first calling ensure initialize that it's uh mapping this to

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840
initialize that it's uh mapping this to

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.230
initialize that it's uh mapping this to an array where the keys are our entity

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240
an array where the keys are our entity

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.310
an array where the keys are our entity classes and this is exactly this get

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320
classes and this is exactly this get

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.669
classes and this is exactly this get entity class that you have to have here.

00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679
entity class that you have to have here.

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:06.950
entity class that you have to have here. Okay. So then we have an array of our uh

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960
Okay. So then we have an array of our uh

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.789
Okay. So then we have an array of our uh fixtures uh template fixtures like those

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799
fixtures uh template fixtures like those

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:12.710
fixtures uh template fixtures like those uh template repositories. Let's call it

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720
uh template repositories. Let's call it

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.149
uh template repositories. Let's call it this way. Um where key is a class name

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159
this way. Um where key is a class name

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:19.350
this way. Um where key is a class name and value is this particular element.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360
and value is this particular element.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.750
and value is this particular element. And then with this we can basically

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760
And then with this we can basically

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.269
And then with this we can basically fetch appropriate uh fixture by the

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279
fetch appropriate uh fixture by the

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:28.789
fetch appropriate uh fixture by the entity that we want to export as an

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799
entity that we want to export as an

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:29.830
entity that we want to export as an example.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840
example.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.269
example. Okay. If I so based on the fact that it

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279
Okay. If I so based on the fact that it

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:36.070
Okay. If I so based on the fact that it stores these sort of in a array, if

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080
stores these sort of in a array, if

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.909
stores these sort of in a array, if someone else were to create a data

00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919
someone else were to create a data

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:39.750
someone else were to create a data fixture and also say they support

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760
fixture and also say they support

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.750
fixture and also say they support usernaming type class, would that cause

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760
usernaming type class, would that cause

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.909
usernaming type class, would that cause an error or would one just override the

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919
an error or would one just override the

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:49.750
an error or would one just override the other sort of silently?

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.510
I think an example would be if I wanted

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520
I think an example would be if I wanted

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:51.830
I think an example would be if I wanted to

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840
to

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.269
to override because I don't see any

00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279
override because I don't see any

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.029
override because I don't see any any checks here.

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039
any checks here.

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:59.029
any checks here. Okay. I was just like if I wanted to

00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039
Okay. I was just like if I wanted to

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:02.310
Okay. I was just like if I wanted to override some core one with a different

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320
override some core one with a different

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.230
override some core one with a different data fixture,

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240
data fixture,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.430
data fixture, as long as I'm loaded later, I would win

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440
as long as I'm loaded later, I would win

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.350
as long as I'm loaded later, I would win because I I think if I were to extend

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360
because I I think if I were to extend

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.830
because I I think if I were to extend some sort of or maybe there's a

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840
some sort of or maybe there's a

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.510
some sort of or maybe there's a different way to deal with that.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520
different way to deal with that.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.870
different way to deal with that. There's no common case to extend the uh

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880
There's no common case to extend the uh

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.750
There's no common case to extend the uh this fixture because those are just some

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760
this fixture because those are just some

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.190
this fixture because those are just some dummy data. Uh but I assume that you can

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200
dummy data. Uh but I assume that you can

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.750
dummy data. Uh but I assume that you can just basically create a new one in your

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760
just basically create a new one in your

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.029
just basically create a new one in your bundle and tag it for the same entity

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039
bundle and tag it for the same entity

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.870
bundle and tag it for the same entity and because your bundle will be loaded

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880
and because your bundle will be loaded

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.830
and because your bundle will be loaded after your will basically will override

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840
after your will basically will override

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.230
after your will basically will override it right because here we are just reg

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240
it right because here we are just reg

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.789
it right because here we are just reg when registering we are just adding it

00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799
when registering we are just adding it

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:45.029
when registering we are just adding it to the uh to the array as an element and

00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039
to the uh to the array as an element and

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:49.590
to the uh to the array as an element and then we'll parsing this array and

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600
then we'll parsing this array and

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.750
then we'll parsing this array and just setting

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760
just setting

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.909
just setting it this way. There is no check for

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919
it this way. There is no check for

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:56.310
it this way. There is no check for duplicate. So I assume from the code

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320
duplicate. So I assume from the code

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.389
duplicate. So I assume from the code this this will just override the

00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399
this this will just override the

00:27:58.399 --> 00:27:59.269
this this will just override the original.

00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279
original.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:27:59.510
original. Okay.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520
Okay.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.549
Okay. So this is the way to override.

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559
So this is the way to override.

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:06.789
So this is the way to override. Okay.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:09.110
Okay guys, let's do 20 minutes break and

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120
Okay guys, let's do 20 minutes break and

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.389
Okay guys, let's do 20 minutes break and we'll start from the workflows topic

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399
we'll start from the workflows topic

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:15.029
we'll start from the workflows topic with the workflows topic. Okay. So get

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039
with the workflows topic. Okay. So get

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:18.470
with the workflows topic. Okay. So get up, grab some coffee.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480
up, grab some coffee.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.549
up, grab some coffee. See you in 20 minutes.

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.230
Okay guys, please let me know if you're

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240
Okay guys, please let me know if you're

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:47.190
Okay guys, please let me know if you're here.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.389
Okay. So as some of you are then let's

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399
Okay. So as some of you are then let's

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:53.110
Okay. So as some of you are then let's start and the topic for today will be

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120
start and the topic for today will be

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.310
start and the topic for today will be about workflows. Uh so I will show you

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320
about workflows. Uh so I will show you

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.870
about workflows. Uh so I will show you in a moment uh where workflows are

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880
in a moment uh where workflows are

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.710
in a moment uh where workflows are listed in the UI how you can create it.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720
listed in the UI how you can create it.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.710
listed in the UI how you can create it. Um and basically what's this is about

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720
Um and basically what's this is about

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.470
Um and basically what's this is about uh so this is basically some

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480
uh so this is basically some

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.789
uh so this is basically some representation of a business process. So

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799
representation of a business process. So

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:15.990
representation of a business process. So we have an entity and we want to uh push

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000
we have an entity and we want to uh push

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.950
we have an entity and we want to uh push this entity through steps uh so this

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960
this entity through steps uh so this

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.310
this entity through steps uh so this entity can be in different states uh and

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320
entity can be in different states uh and

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.510
entity can be in different states uh and then do basically something here. So uh

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520
then do basically something here. So uh

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.510
then do basically something here. So uh first thing to remember is that workflow

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520
first thing to remember is that workflow

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.269
first thing to remember is that workflow is always bound to some particular

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279
is always bound to some particular

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.950
is always bound to some particular entity.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960
entity.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.750
entity. Uh and uh we have some uh already

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760
Uh and uh we have some uh already

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.070
Uh and uh we have some uh already existing workflows out of the box in the

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080
existing workflows out of the box in the

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.230
existing workflows out of the box in the system. Uh and basically the whole

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240
system. Uh and basically the whole

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.070
system. Uh and basically the whole checkout in the storefront is also a

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080
checkout in the storefront is also a

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.750
checkout in the storefront is also a workflow. Uh it's very big and very

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760
workflow. Uh it's very big and very

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.710
workflow. Uh it's very big and very complicated one uh big one with a lot of

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720
complicated one uh big one with a lot of

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.750
complicated one uh big one with a lot of transitions but it's still a workflow.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760
transitions but it's still a workflow.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.950
transitions but it's still a workflow. Uh so the idea is that we have a start

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960
Uh so the idea is that we have a start

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.669
Uh so the idea is that we have a start step then we have some other steps and

00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679
step then we have some other steps and

00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:00.630
step then we have some other steps and we are transiting our entity from one

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640
we are transiting our entity from one

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.190
we are transiting our entity from one step to the other. Okay. Um

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200
step to the other. Okay. Um

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.070
step to the other. Okay. Um and we sometimes have a final step. I

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080
and we sometimes have a final step. I

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.710
and we sometimes have a final step. I mean we can have multiple final steps.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720
mean we can have multiple final steps.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.909
mean we can have multiple final steps. Uh we can have one for the start step.

00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919
Uh we can have one for the start step.

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:15.909
Uh we can have one for the start step. It's always one. We can have multiple

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919
It's always one. We can have multiple

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.830
It's always one. We can have multiple start transition. For example, for the

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840
start transition. For example, for the

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.070
start transition. For example, for the checkout workflow, we can start the

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080
checkout workflow, we can start the

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.470
checkout workflow, we can start the checkout from multiple places. So in the

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480
checkout from multiple places. So in the

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.389
checkout from multiple places. So in the storefront, you can start check out from

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399
storefront, you can start check out from

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:26.710
storefront, you can start check out from the shopping list. You can start check

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720
the shopping list. You can start check

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.630
the shopping list. You can start check out from the old order by clicking

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640
out from the old order by clicking

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.190
out from the old order by clicking reorder button. And you can also start

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200
reorder button. And you can also start

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.950
reorder button. And you can also start check out from quick order form. But

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960
check out from quick order form. But

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.789
check out from quick order form. But basically those are transitions. They

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799
basically those are transitions. They

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:37.669
basically those are transitions. They all lead to one start step.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679
all lead to one start step.

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:40.630
all lead to one start step. Uh and in the back office we can enable

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640
Uh and in the back office we can enable

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.350
Uh and in the back office we can enable disable them.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360
disable them.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.110
disable them. Uh so uh basically this works as a state

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120
Uh so uh basically this works as a state

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.510
Uh so uh basically this works as a state machine that is assigned to some entity

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520
machine that is assigned to some entity

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.630
machine that is assigned to some entity where states are our steps. Then this

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640
where states are our steps. Then this

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.149
where states are our steps. Then this workflow can have some internal data. So

00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159
workflow can have some internal data. So

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:57.830
workflow can have some internal data. So first of all we have this entity that

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840
first of all we have this entity that

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.830
first of all we have this entity that this workflow is bound to but we can

00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840
this workflow is bound to but we can

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.510
this workflow is bound to but we can have some other additional uh

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520
have some other additional uh

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.310
have some other additional uh information like logged in user ID or

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320
information like logged in user ID or

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.710
information like logged in user ID or basically whatever you can think of and

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720
basically whatever you can think of and

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.430
basically whatever you can think of and those are our attributes workflow

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440
those are our attributes workflow

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.389
those are our attributes workflow attributes. Uh then whenever we change a

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399
attributes. Uh then whenever we change a

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:15.029
attributes. Uh then whenever we change a state so go from one step to the other

00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039
state so go from one step to the other

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.510
state so go from one step to the other this is called transition. If we want to

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520
this is called transition. If we want to

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.029
this is called transition. If we want to do some additional um function some

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039
do some additional um function some

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:24.950
do some additional um function some additional things while transitioning we

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960
additional things while transitioning we

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.669
additional things while transitioning we have separate place for it and in our

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679
have separate place for it and in our

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:28.950
have separate place for it and in our case this is called transition

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960
case this is called transition

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.590
case this is called transition definition. So if you want to do some

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600
definition. So if you want to do some

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.990
definition. So if you want to do some additional business logic, send emails

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000
additional business logic, send emails

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.870
additional business logic, send emails or I don't know clone entity, process

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880
or I don't know clone entity, process

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.389
or I don't know clone entity, process something in a custom way, uh then

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399
something in a custom way, uh then

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:44.950
something in a custom way, uh then transition definition is for um this

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960
transition definition is for um this

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.750
transition definition is for um this code and additionally to that we have

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760
code and additionally to that we have

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.669
code and additionally to that we have also data restrictions. So we can for

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679
also data restrictions. So we can for

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:53.430
also data restrictions. So we can for example restrict some particular data uh

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440
example restrict some particular data uh

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.830
example restrict some particular data uh from the workflow or from some

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840
from the workflow or from some

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.990
from the workflow or from some particular step. For example, you can

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000
particular step. For example, you can

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.470
particular step. For example, you can have an entity that have status field

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480
have an entity that have status field

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.630
have an entity that have status field and you have 10 different statuses, but

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640
and you have 10 different statuses, but

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.350
and you have 10 different statuses, but you want all only two of them to be

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360
you want all only two of them to be

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.990
you want all only two of them to be available in some particular step. In

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000
available in some particular step. In

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.470
available in some particular step. In this case, the place for it is entity

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480
this case, the place for it is entity

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.630
this case, the place for it is entity restrictions. And I will show you all

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640
restrictions. And I will show you all

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.110
restrictions. And I will show you all those elements one by one in a moment.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120
those elements one by one in a moment.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.029
those elements one by one in a moment. But first, let's uh check how workflows

00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039
But first, let's uh check how workflows

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:22.710
But first, let's uh check how workflows look in the UI.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720
look in the UI.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.470
look in the UI. So here under system workflows

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480
So here under system workflows

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.710
So here under system workflows uh we have a list of all available

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720
uh we have a list of all available

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.350
uh we have a list of all available workflows. Some of them are active some

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360
workflows. Some of them are active some

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.110
workflows. Some of them are active some not

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120
not

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.149
not uh and they are bound to some particular

00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159
uh and they are bound to some particular

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.389
uh and they are bound to some particular entity.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399
entity.

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.470
entity. A system means that this workflow was

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480
A system means that this workflow was

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.430
A system means that this workflow was created uh from a file and this will be

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440
created uh from a file and this will be

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.590
created uh from a file and this will be a YAML file and I will show you in a

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600
a YAML file and I will show you in a

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.750
a YAML file and I will show you in a moment how to create a workflow from the

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760
moment how to create a workflow from the

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.350
moment how to create a workflow from the YAML file. uh priority

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360
YAML file. uh priority

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.509
YAML file. uh priority self explanator

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519
self explanator

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:56.389
self explanator it's explaining itself then applications

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399
it's explaining itself then applications

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:58.149
it's explaining itself then applications commerce for the storefront so this will

00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159
commerce for the storefront so this will

00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:00.230
commerce for the storefront so this will be storefront workflow default this is

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240
be storefront workflow default this is

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.909
be storefront workflow default this is for back office so this will be back

00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919
for back office so this will be back

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:04.630
for back office so this will be back office work workflow and then we have

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640
office work workflow and then we have

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.110
office work workflow and then we have two separate interesting parameters that

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120
two separate interesting parameters that

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.389
two separate interesting parameters that work as a tag so if two workflows like

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399
work as a tag so if two workflows like

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:12.870
work as a tag so if two workflows like this one this checkout workflow have the

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880
this one this checkout workflow have the

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.750
this one this checkout workflow have the same exclusive active group and this

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760
same exclusive active group and this

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.070
same exclusive active group and this works as a tag so if I have this then

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080
works as a tag so if I have this then

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.029
works as a tag so if I have this then they cannot be active at the same time.

00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039
they cannot be active at the same time.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.110
they cannot be active at the same time. So as you can see for the checkout we

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120
So as you can see for the checkout we

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.430
So as you can see for the checkout we have check normal checkout and single

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440
have check normal checkout and single

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.950
have check normal checkout and single page checkout and whenever I will try to

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960
page checkout and whenever I will try to

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.990
page checkout and whenever I will try to enable for example this one in the

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000
enable for example this one in the

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.310
enable for example this one in the process the other one will be disabled

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320
process the other one will be disabled

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.149
process the other one will be disabled because they cannot be both active at

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159
because they cannot be both active at

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:40.389
because they cannot be both active at the same time then we actually don't

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399
the same time then we actually don't

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:42.789
the same time then we actually don't have this situation in this example but

00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799
have this situation in this example but

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:45.269
have this situation in this example but imagine that this is empty and we have

00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279
imagine that this is empty and we have

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.830
imagine that this is empty and we have only specified exclusive record group

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840
only specified exclusive record group

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.830
only specified exclusive record group this will mean that they can both be

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840
this will mean that they can both be

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.669
this will mean that they can both be active and as a result you will have uh

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679
active and as a result you will have uh

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:56.870
active and as a result you will have uh two buttons. You'll be able to uh start

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880
two buttons. You'll be able to uh start

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.990
two buttons. You'll be able to uh start this or this. But if you start the first

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000
this or this. But if you start the first

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.230
this or this. But if you start the first one, the second will not be available

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240
one, the second will not be available

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.029
one, the second will not be available anymore. Okay. So this means that they

00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039
anymore. Okay. So this means that they

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:07.110
anymore. Okay. So this means that they can be both active but they cannot be

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120
can be both active but they cannot be

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.750
can be both active but they cannot be both started at on top of of your

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760
both started at on top of of your

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.310
both started at on top of of your entity. only one of them can be started

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320
entity. only one of them can be started

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.510
entity. only one of them can be started and created at is created at

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520
and created at is created at

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.310
and created at is created at um

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320
um

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.669
um okay uh all those were created from file

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679
okay uh all those were created from file

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.510
okay uh all those were created from file from the y file if you create a workflow

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520
from the y file if you create a workflow

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.589
from the y file if you create a workflow from here because we can do this and I

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599
from here because we can do this and I

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.750
from here because we can do this and I will do this actually right now then the

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760
will do this actually right now then the

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.149
will do this actually right now then the system will be no because this will be

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159
system will be no because this will be

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:36.230
system will be no because this will be uh your workflow created via the UI uh

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240
uh your workflow created via the UI uh

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.710
uh your workflow created via the UI uh so what you can do from the UI actually

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720
so what you can do from the UI actually

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.909
so what you can do from the UI actually you are restricted it to only those

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919
you are restricted it to only those

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:46.149
you are restricted it to only those parts. You can create steps. You can

00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159
parts. You can create steps. You can

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.389
parts. You can create steps. You can change you can create some transitions

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399
change you can create some transitions

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:51.510
change you can create some transitions and create a form popup when this

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520
and create a form popup when this

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.589
and create a form popup when this transition is happening. But actually

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599
transition is happening. But actually

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.829
transition is happening. But actually transition definitions are not available

00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839
transition definitions are not available

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:58.150
transition definitions are not available from here. You're not able to do any

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160
from here. You're not able to do any

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.230
from here. You're not able to do any other business logic. So creating

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240
other business logic. So creating

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.150
other business logic. So creating workflows from the UI, you have only

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160
workflows from the UI, you have only

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.190
workflows from the UI, you have only very very simple options here.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200
very very simple options here.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.310
very very simple options here. Uh so let's create my workflow for the

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320
Uh so let's create my workflow for the

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.390
Uh so let's create my workflow for the contact entity.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.470
No exclusive active group, no exclusive

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480
No exclusive active group, no exclusive

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.870
No exclusive active group, no exclusive record group. I need to select default

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880
record group. I need to select default

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.829
record group. I need to select default step, but I don't have any steps yet. So

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839
step, but I don't have any steps yet. So

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:21.990
step, but I don't have any steps yet. So I will select this in a moment. And I

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000
I will select this in a moment. And I

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.870
I will select this in a moment. And I want those steps to be ordered. So here

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880
want those steps to be ordered. So here

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.750
want those steps to be ordered. So here I can create a step. And let's say that

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760
I can create a step. And let's say that

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.150
I can create a step. And let's say that I will

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160
I will

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.069
I will cancel it.

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079
cancel it.

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:34.870
cancel it. I will in my workflow

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880
I will in my workflow

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.510
I will in my workflow uh create a workflow that will allow me

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520
uh create a workflow that will allow me

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.670
uh create a workflow that will allow me to fill in uh

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680
to fill in uh

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.750
to fill in uh like Facebook uh and all those uh

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760
like Facebook uh and all those uh

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.710
like Facebook uh and all those uh information about social media.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720
information about social media.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.790
information about social media. Um so let's do that. My first step

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800
Um so let's do that. My first step

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.270
Um so let's do that. My first step will be just in it first step.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280
will be just in it first step.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:05.349
will be just in it first step. Then I will have a step called Facebook

00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:08.550
like this. And it's not final. I will

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560
like this. And it's not final. I will

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.230
like this. And it's not final. I will not have a final step to be honest

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240
not have a final step to be honest

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.630
not have a final step to be honest because I will create a loop.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:21.349
then Twitter.

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:23.829
Okay. So I have three steps and I will

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839
Okay. So I have three steps and I will

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.270
Okay. So I have three steps and I will create a loop. So I will create

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280
create a loop. So I will create

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.190
create a loop. So I will create transition from init to Facebook, then

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200
transition from init to Facebook, then

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.030
transition from init to Facebook, then from Facebook to Twitter and then from

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040
from Facebook to Twitter and then from

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.430
from Facebook to Twitter and then from Twitter to init.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440
Twitter to init.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.910
Twitter to init. So let's add transition.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920
So let's add transition.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.069
So let's add transition. Uh first we will fill in the Facebook

00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079
Uh first we will fill in the Facebook

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:40.950
Uh first we will fill in the Facebook data. So let's say add Facebook

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.710
from init step to Facebook step and

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720
from init step to Facebook step and

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.430
from init step to Facebook step and actually I want to fill in this Facebook

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440
actually I want to fill in this Facebook

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.510
actually I want to fill in this Facebook data when this transition is happening.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520
data when this transition is happening.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.310
data when this transition is happening. So the only thing that I can do here is

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320
So the only thing that I can do here is

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.589
So the only thing that I can do here is to display a form in a popup and I want

00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599
to display a form in a popup and I want

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:58.470
to display a form in a popup and I want this to happen uh and I need to in the

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480
this to happen uh and I need to in the

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.470
this to happen uh and I need to in the attribute section specify what will be

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480
attribute section specify what will be

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.630
attribute section specify what will be in this form. If you don't specify

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640
in this form. If you don't specify

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.710
in this form. If you don't specify anything here, then the form will just

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720
anything here, then the form will just

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.150
anything here, then the form will just not be there at all. So I want to edit

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160
not be there at all. So I want to edit

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.670
not be there at all. So I want to edit Facebook field. Uh I will leave label

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680
Facebook field. Uh I will leave label

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.670
Facebook field. Uh I will leave label empty. So this will be taken from

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680
empty. So this will be taken from

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.710
empty. So this will be taken from translation. And then I will mark it as

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720
translation. And then I will mark it as

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.750
translation. And then I will mark it as required. Okay. Add. Apply. And we have

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760
required. Okay. Add. Apply. And we have

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.390
required. Okay. Add. Apply. And we have our first transition. Then I will add

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400
our first transition. Then I will add

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.270
our first transition. Then I will add second transition

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280
second transition

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.589
second transition at Twitter from Facebook to Twitter.

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599
at Twitter from Facebook to Twitter.

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:36.870
at Twitter from Facebook to Twitter. Also I want to have a form

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880
Also I want to have a form

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.630
Also I want to have a form where I will have

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640
where I will have

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.470
where I will have you specify Twitter.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.190
Uh okay. And here also you have some

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200
Uh okay. And here also you have some

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.790
Uh okay. And here also you have some preview for the button. So uh the label

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800
preview for the button. So uh the label

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.190
preview for the button. So uh the label is automatically here created. You can

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200
is automatically here created. You can

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.349
is automatically here created. You can change the label title. You can change

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359
change the label title. You can change

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:59.349
change the label title. You can change the uh icon. Um and you have preview

00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359
the uh icon. Um and you have preview

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:02.710
the uh icon. Um and you have preview here and you can change the

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720
here and you can change the

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:09.910
here and you can change the or

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.870
actually I don't want it. Uh so

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880
actually I don't want it. Uh so

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.190
actually I don't want it. Uh so basically you can do whatever you need.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200
basically you can do whatever you need.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.589
basically you can do whatever you need. Okay. And then I want this to be a loop.

00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599
Okay. And then I want this to be a loop.

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.069
Okay. And then I want this to be a loop. So I will create a third transition from

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079
So I will create a third transition from

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:25.109
So I will create a third transition from uh Twitter back to init.

00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119
uh Twitter back to init.

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:27.829
uh Twitter back to init. So let's add transition

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839
So let's add transition

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:38.710
So let's add transition call it

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.270
whatever from Twitter back to init and I

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280
whatever from Twitter back to init and I

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.190
whatever from Twitter back to init and I will not specify any attributes. So the

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200
will not specify any attributes. So the

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.349
will not specify any attributes. So the form popup will not be displayed because

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359
form popup will not be displayed because

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:51.510
form popup will not be displayed because I didn't specify any attributes.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520
I didn't specify any attributes.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.630
I didn't specify any attributes. And that's it. Right now I can select

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640
And that's it. Right now I can select

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.390
And that's it. Right now I can select default step to be an init. And down

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400
default step to be an init. And down

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.870
default step to be an init. And down here we even have our beautiful loop

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880
here we even have our beautiful loop

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.670
here we even have our beautiful loop displayed.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680
displayed.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.109
displayed. Okay.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:15.109
So now I can save it.

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119
So now I can save it.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.870
So now I can save it. And as you can see, it was created, but

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880
And as you can see, it was created, but

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.150
And as you can see, it was created, but it's still inactive. Uh, so I still

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160
it's still inactive. Uh, so I still

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.270
it's still inactive. Uh, so I still don't have any workflow here. In the

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280
don't have any workflow here. In the

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.109
don't have any workflow here. In the storefront, there is no automatic

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119
storefront, there is no automatic

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:27.190
storefront, there is no automatic displaying of any workflow. So in the

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200
displaying of any workflow. So in the

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.589
displaying of any workflow. So in the storefront, the checkout has custom

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599
storefront, the checkout has custom

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:31.670
storefront, the checkout has custom layouts, etc. And if you create any

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680
layouts, etc. And if you create any

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.510
layouts, etc. And if you create any workflow for the storefront, you will

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520
workflow for the storefront, you will

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.750
workflow for the storefront, you will need to manually display their uh

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760
need to manually display their uh

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.750
need to manually display their uh implement displaying it there. For the

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760
implement displaying it there. For the

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.349
implement displaying it there. For the back office, the situation is a little

00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359
back office, the situation is a little

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:42.069
back office, the situation is a little bit different because when we have a

00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079
bit different because when we have a

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.310
bit different because when we have a workflow bound to some entity on the

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320
workflow bound to some entity on the

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.950
workflow bound to some entity on the view page like here on my contact view

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960
view page like here on my contact view

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.190
view page like here on my contact view page, I will see a workflow bar here

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200
page, I will see a workflow bar here

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.829
page, I will see a workflow bar here just below this created at and so on.

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839
just below this created at and so on.

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:53.829
just below this created at and so on. So, it will be here. So, let's

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839
So, it will be here. So, let's

00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:56.390
So, it will be here. So, let's inactivate this workflow.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400
inactivate this workflow.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.589
inactivate this workflow. And uh it's just asking me if in the

00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599
And uh it's just asking me if in the

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.750
And uh it's just asking me if in the process of activating this workflow, I'd

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760
process of activating this workflow, I'd

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.910
process of activating this workflow, I'd like to deactivate any other and I

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920
like to deactivate any other and I

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.109
like to deactivate any other and I don't. So, I'll just activate this one.

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119
don't. So, I'll just activate this one.

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:10.230
don't. So, I'll just activate this one. refresh my page

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240
refresh my page

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.990
refresh my page and now we have a workflow bar here.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000
and now we have a workflow bar here.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.510
and now we have a workflow bar here. Okay.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520
Okay.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.470
Okay. And we can start.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480
And we can start.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.589
And we can start. Then we are in the init step. We can we

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599
Then we are in the init step. We can we

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.829
Then we are in the init step. We can we now have the seconds transition to add

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839
now have the seconds transition to add

00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:25.829
now have the seconds transition to add Facebook. So I have appropriate button

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839
Facebook. So I have appropriate button

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:29.270
Facebook. So I have appropriate button rendered and I will just fill in this

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280
rendered and I will just fill in this

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.829
rendered and I will just fill in this data

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839
data

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:36.150
data and they will be saved to my entity. And

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160
and they will be saved to my entity. And

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.870
and they will be saved to my entity. And now I'm in the second step. I can add

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880
now I'm in the second step. I can add

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.910
now I'm in the second step. I can add Twitter

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.349
whatever value just for testing.

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.069
And I have the second social field in

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079
And I have the second social field in

00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:52.550
And I have the second social field in here. And I can go back to init by

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560
here. And I can go back to init by

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.790
here. And I can go back to init by clicking revert.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.950
Um, and that's basically everything you

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960
Um, and that's basically everything you

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.109
Um, and that's basically everything you can do from the UI, right? You are

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119
can do from the UI, right? You are

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:04.950
can do from the UI, right? You are restricted to all. That's the only thing

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960
restricted to all. That's the only thing

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.990
restricted to all. That's the only thing it that you can click from here. It's

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000
it that you can click from here. It's

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.150
it that you can click from here. It's creating this form popup and fill in

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160
creating this form popup and fill in

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.470
creating this form popup and fill in some additional data

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480
some additional data

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.190
some additional data um based on all the fields that you have

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200
um based on all the fields that you have

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.069
um based on all the fields that you have available for your entity.

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:22.950
Okay. So if you'd like to do something

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960
Okay. So if you'd like to do something

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.109
Okay. So if you'd like to do something more then uh and basically this workflow

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119
more then uh and basically this workflow

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:29.750
more then uh and basically this workflow exists only right now for me because I

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760
exists only right now for me because I

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.510
exists only right now for me because I created it and I would need to share

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520
created it and I would need to share

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.829
created it and I would need to share database time for you to have it. So

00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839
database time for you to have it. So

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:36.390
database time for you to have it. So it's basically good to test something or

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400
it's basically good to test something or

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.190
it's basically good to test something or to demo something but normally we create

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200
to demo something but normally we create

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.109
to demo something but normally we create all the workflows

00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119
all the workflows

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:44.950
all the workflows uh from code.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960
uh from code.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:56.710
uh from code. Uh and this definition says yes.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.829
Yeah.

00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839
Yeah.

00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:01.270
Yeah. Yeah. Could you please repeat the last

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280
Yeah. Could you please repeat the last

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.950
Yeah. Could you please repeat the last two step after Twitter how it's de

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960
two step after Twitter how it's de

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.470
two step after Twitter how it's de action is being triggered?

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480
action is being triggered?

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.390
action is being triggered? I I'm not clear about it.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.349
Can you repeat the question?

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359
Can you repeat the question?

00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:20.150
Can you repeat the question? I'm not sure I understand.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160
I'm not sure I understand.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.670
I'm not sure I understand. In the last step there is a reboot uh

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680
In the last step there is a reboot uh

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.349
In the last step there is a reboot uh action, right?

00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359
action, right?

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:28.870
action, right? Mhm. Yes. I just created that transition

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880
Mhm. Yes. I just created that transition

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.510
Mhm. Yes. I just created that transition to go back to init. Mhm.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520
to go back to init. Mhm.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.510
to go back to init. Mhm. So after adding the Twitter uh and I

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520
So after adding the Twitter uh and I

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.030
So after adding the Twitter uh and I think you click on somewhere for uh next

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040
think you click on somewhere for uh next

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.230
think you click on somewhere for uh next action is reward. So can you repeat that

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240
action is reward. So can you repeat that

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.270
action is reward. So can you repeat that flow again? I just want to

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280
flow again? I just want to

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:52.470
flow again? I just want to get it.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:58.390
Now I have at Facebook, then I'll have

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400
Now I have at Facebook, then I'll have

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.950
Now I have at Facebook, then I'll have at Twitter, and then I'll have

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960
at Twitter, and then I'll have

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.109
at Twitter, and then I'll have revert. So I have basically three

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119
revert. So I have basically three

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:08.309
revert. So I have basically three buttons that goes to three transitions

00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319
buttons that goes to three transitions

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:11.349
buttons that goes to three transitions that are here. Add Facebook, at Twitter,

00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359
that are here. Add Facebook, at Twitter,

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.190
that are here. Add Facebook, at Twitter, and revert.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200
and revert.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.670
and revert. I just created a loop. It's a very dummy

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680
I just created a loop. It's a very dummy

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.589
I just created a loop. It's a very dummy workflow to be honest.

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599
workflow to be honest.

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:20.870
workflow to be honest. Okay. Okay. So I thought you clicking uh

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880
Okay. Okay. So I thought you clicking uh

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.270
Okay. Okay. So I thought you clicking uh after once once you're back to revert

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280
after once once you're back to revert

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.349
after once once you're back to revert state that means it's reverting back all

00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359
state that means it's reverting back all

00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:30.950
state that means it's reverting back all the all the actions which you g so far

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960
the all the actions which you g so far

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.990
the all the actions which you g so far because it's still

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000
because it's still

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.630
because it's still nothing is cleared out those data are

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640
nothing is cleared out those data are

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.910
nothing is cleared out those data are still here.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920
still here.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.710
still here. Yeah that's why I'm confused. So revert

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720
Yeah that's why I'm confused. So revert

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.910
Yeah that's why I'm confused. So revert action means what and not

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920
action means what and not

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.990
action means what and not the revert itself it's say reverting

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000
the revert itself it's say reverting

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.750
the revert itself it's say reverting back all the actions which you g so far

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760
back all the actions which you g so far

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.829
back all the actions which you g so far I just create a transition that is doing

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839
I just create a transition that is doing

00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:52.150
I just create a transition that is doing nothing to be able to go to the first

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160
nothing to be able to go to the first

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.910
nothing to be able to go to the first step and to just be able to once again

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920
step and to just be able to once again

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.950
step and to just be able to once again fill the Facebook data for example

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960
fill the Facebook data for example

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.670
fill the Facebook data for example because I want to change it this way. So

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680
because I want to change it this way. So

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.870
because I want to change it this way. So the my uh last action it's not doing

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.150
the my uh last action it's not doing anything.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160
anything.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.790

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800
Oh, okay.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.270
Oh, okay. This transition revert is just an empty

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280
This transition revert is just an empty

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.190
This transition revert is just an empty transition. This is this one.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200
transition. This is this one.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.390
transition. This is this one. Okay,

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400
Okay,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.109
Okay, I can deactivate it to edit and show you

00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119
I can deactivate it to edit and show you

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:22.790
I can deactivate it to edit and show you this transition is not

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800
this transition is not

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.550
this transition is not doing anything.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.589
We cannot edit it. Ah because I'm not on

00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599
We cannot edit it. Ah because I'm not on

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:37.030
We cannot edit it. Ah because I'm not on the edit page obvious

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040
the edit page obvious

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.349
the edit page obvious uh transition.

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.990
Okay. So this transition it's not doing

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000
Okay. So this transition it's not doing

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.670
Okay. So this transition it's not doing anything. It's not changing any

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680
anything. It's not changing any

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.150
anything. It's not changing any attributes anything and you cannot

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160
attributes anything and you cannot

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.030
attributes anything and you cannot basically from the UI you are not able

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040
basically from the UI you are not able

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.150
basically from the UI you are not able to clear anything out. You're only able

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160
to clear anything out. You're only able

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.030
to clear anything out. You're only able to specify that there will be some form

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040
to specify that there will be some form

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.750
to specify that there will be some form popup and what fields will be in this

00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760
popup and what fields will be in this

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.309
popup and what fields will be in this form popup. So via the UI you're very

00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319
form popup. So via the UI you're very

00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:06.390
form popup. So via the UI you're very restricted. I called this action revert

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400
restricted. I called this action revert

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.470
restricted. I called this action revert but this is only reverting me to the

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480
but this is only reverting me to the

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.470
but this is only reverting me to the first step. It's not doing anything in

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480
first step. It's not doing anything in

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.670
first step. It's not doing anything in the process.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680
the process.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.630
the process. Okay. I thought revert means we are

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640
Okay. I thought revert means we are

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.309
Okay. I thought revert means we are reverting back what we already did. So

00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319
reverting back what we already did. So

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:18.710
reverting back what we already did. So yeah

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720
yeah

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.510
yeah I can name this action whatever I want.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520
I can name this action whatever I want.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:27.589
I can name this action whatever I want. If you prefer prefer I can just go back.

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599
If you prefer prefer I can just go back.

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.510
If you prefer prefer I can just go back. Okay.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520
Okay.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.829
Okay. In in case if you want to skip step two

00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839
In in case if you want to skip step two

00:45:33.839 --> 00:45:36.470
In in case if you want to skip step two then can we do it? Okay. For that you

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480
then can we do it? Okay. For that you

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.670
then can we do it? Okay. For that you have to uh remove that required action.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680
have to uh remove that required action.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.309
have to uh remove that required action. Okay.

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319
Okay.

00:45:42.319 --> 00:45:42.950
Okay. Okay.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960
Okay.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.109
Okay. So if you want to create those step

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119
So if you want to create those step

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:47.109
So if you want to create those step differently for example create some

00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119
differently for example create some

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:49.589
differently for example create some additional transition from init directly

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599
additional transition from init directly

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:52.309
additional transition from init directly to Twitter then just add additional

00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319
to Twitter then just add additional

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:54.870
to Twitter then just add additional transition. So those arrows are

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880
transition. So those arrows are

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.750
transition. So those arrows are transitions and those are steps. So it's

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760
transitions and those are steps. So it's

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.390
transitions and those are steps. So it's totally up to you what transitions you

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400
totally up to you what transitions you

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.870
totally up to you what transitions you will create.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880
will create.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.710
will create. So you can go from init to Twitter. Um

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720
So you can go from init to Twitter. Um

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.589
So you can go from init to Twitter. Um and this

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:14.790
here when this transition is happening

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800
here when this transition is happening

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.670
here when this transition is happening you can display form popup and then here

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680
you can display form popup and then here

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:23.589
you can display form popup and then here you can specify if it's required or not.

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599
you can specify if it's required or not.

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:25.990
you can specify if it's required or not. But this will go to when the pop-up is

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000
But this will go to when the pop-up is

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.870
But this will go to when the pop-up is displayed then you will need to pass the

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880
displayed then you will need to pass the

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.829
displayed then you will need to pass the value in this form or you will be able

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839
value in this form or you will be able

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.750
value in this form or you will be able to go to the next step without filling

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760
to go to the next step without filling

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.910
to go to the next step without filling in in this value but that's the only

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920
in in this value but that's the only

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.270
in in this value but that's the only thing you can do from here.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.390
Okay. Thank you.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400
Okay. Thank you.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.470
Okay. Thank you. I will cancel this and oh where is my

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480
I will cancel this and oh where is my

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:55.030
I will cancel this and oh where is my workflow? Let's activate it.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:04.390
Okay. So, I have it back here.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.829
Start it again. Okay.

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839
Start it again. Okay.

00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:10.550
Start it again. Okay. Uh, okay. So, if you want to do the same

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560
Uh, okay. So, if you want to do the same

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.870
Uh, okay. So, if you want to do the same but not from the UI, which is the

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880
but not from the UI, which is the

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.270
but not from the UI, which is the preferable way.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280
preferable way.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.510
preferable way. Yep.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520
Yep.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.670
Yep. Sorry to jump in. I was just thinking

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680
Sorry to jump in. I was just thinking

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.589
Sorry to jump in. I was just thinking about something. Does it if you have

00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599
about something. Does it if you have

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:23.190
about something. Does it if you have like multiple workflows, do they just

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200
like multiple workflows, do they just

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.349
like multiple workflows, do they just stack up at the top or is there like

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359
stack up at the top or is there like

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:27.270
stack up at the top or is there like does it sort of change the UI at some

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280
does it sort of change the UI at some

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.589
does it sort of change the UI at some point? Like if I had like 20 workflows

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599
point? Like if I had like 20 workflows

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:32.390
point? Like if I had like 20 workflows for contacts, would they

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400
for contacts, would they

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.230
for contacts, would they hide or something?

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240
hide or something?

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.390
hide or something? They will be one after the other.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400
They will be one after the other.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:36.790
They will be one after the other. Okay.

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800
Okay.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.589
Okay. Uh we never assumed that you will have

00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599
Uh we never assumed that you will have

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:40.710
Uh we never assumed that you will have more than two,

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720
more than two,

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.510
more than two, okay?

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520
okay?

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.750
okay? Or three, but they will be just one

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760
Or three, but they will be just one

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.630
Or three, but they will be just one after the other. And uh we have this

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640
after the other. And uh we have this

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.150
after the other. And uh we have this situation

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160
situation

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.309
situation for quotes.

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319
for quotes.

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.390
for quotes. Yeah, I can see certain things having

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400
Yeah, I can see certain things having

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.069
Yeah, I can see certain things having for quotes here.

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079
for quotes here.

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:59.910
for quotes here. Here we have one workflow and second

00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920
Here we have one workflow and second

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.870
Here we have one workflow and second workflow.

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880
workflow.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.710
workflow. Okay. Oh, there is a little collapse

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720
Okay. Oh, there is a little collapse

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.030
Okay. Oh, there is a little collapse thing on the left there.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040
thing on the left there.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.150
thing on the left there. Uh yeah.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160
Uh yeah.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.190
Uh yeah. Okay.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200
Okay.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:07.829
Okay. But still

00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839
But still

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:08.630
But still helps a little bit.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640
helps a little bit.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.150
helps a little bit. One after the other.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160
One after the other.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.990
One after the other. Yeah. Well, at least you can collapse

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000
Yeah. Well, at least you can collapse

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.750
Yeah. Well, at least you can collapse them. So like if you did have a lot I

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760
them. So like if you did have a lot I

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.589
them. So like if you did have a lot I could see products and stuff like that

00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599
could see products and stuff like that

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:19.349
could see products and stuff like that maybe having more for updating different

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359
maybe having more for updating different

00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:21.270
maybe having more for updating different types of data so you don't have to look

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280
types of data so you don't have to look

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.030
types of data so you don't have to look at a giant form all the time.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040
at a giant form all the time.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.910
at a giant form all the time. Yeah. Yeah. So it it has collapsed but

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920
Yeah. Yeah. So it it has collapsed but

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.390
Yeah. Yeah. So it it has collapsed but it's still not collapsed by default.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400
it's still not collapsed by default.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.030
it's still not collapsed by default. Yeah.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040
Yeah.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.750
Yeah. So you will see like enormous amount of

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760
So you will see like enormous amount of

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.950
So you will see like enormous amount of workflows here.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960
workflows here.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.230
workflows here. Okay.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.069
Okay. Another question.

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079
Okay. Another question.

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:46.069
Okay. Another question. Uh hi. Yeah, one little question. Uh on

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079
Uh hi. Yeah, one little question. Uh on

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:50.309
Uh hi. Yeah, one little question. Uh on your uh presentation, I've seen that uh

00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319
your uh presentation, I've seen that uh

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:52.710
your uh presentation, I've seen that uh your workflow

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720
your workflow

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.109
your workflow um is presented as a bar and all steps

00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119
um is presented as a bar and all steps

00:48:57.119 --> 00:49:01.990
um is presented as a bar and all steps are rendered as bar. But when I do it

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000
are rendered as bar. But when I do it

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.510
are rendered as bar. But when I do it just a but just a button and status

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520
just a but just a button and status

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.270
just a but just a button and status um I don't see the the whole workflow

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280
um I don't see the the whole workflow

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.910
um I don't see the the whole workflow from step to step like you

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920
from step to step like you

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.950
from step to step like you okay you mean the difference with

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960
okay you mean the difference with

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.910
okay you mean the difference with displaying it

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920
displaying it

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.390
displaying it okay

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400
okay

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.470
okay same as what is uh

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480
same as what is uh

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.549
same as what is uh you have seen

00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559
you have seen

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:30.710
you have seen it looks different what you have shown

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720
it looks different what you have shown

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.309
it looks different what you have shown to us on your Facebook flow training

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319
to us on your Facebook flow training

00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:37.750
to us on your Facebook flow training flow

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.950
maybe because of that switch

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960
maybe because of that switch

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.510
maybe because of that switch I'm not sure I assume that that's just

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520
I'm not sure I assume that that's just

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.589
I'm not sure I assume that that's just new way of displaying it in the newer

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599
new way of displaying it in the newer

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:50.470
new way of displaying it in the newer version of or

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480
version of or

00:49:50.480 --> 00:50:00.470
version of or I can check actually why not

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.750
Let's go to the contact. If this will

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760
Let's go to the contact. If this will

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.950
Let's go to the contact. If this will not be the issue, I will mean I mean the

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960
not be the issue, I will mean I mean the

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.190
not be the issue, I will mean I mean the reason then I will check. Yeah, that's

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200
reason then I will check. Yeah, that's

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.870
reason then I will check. Yeah, that's exactly the difference. So if you have

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880
exactly the difference. So if you have

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.270
exactly the difference. So if you have the switch to display steps ordered, I

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280
the switch to display steps ordered, I

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.109
the switch to display steps ordered, I will create to show you this display

00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119
will create to show you this display

00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:21.349
will create to show you this display steps ordered. If you have it selected,

00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359
steps ordered. If you have it selected,

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:24.790
steps ordered. If you have it selected, then it will be in this way that you saw

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800
then it will be in this way that you saw

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.109
then it will be in this way that you saw me showing you at the beginning. If it's

00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119
me showing you at the beginning. If it's

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.750
me showing you at the beginning. If it's not selected then just we display it

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760
not selected then just we display it

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.710
not selected then just we display it differently like this. So we are in this

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720
differently like this. So we are in this

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.549
differently like this. So we are in this step and then we have this button here.

00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559
step and then we have this button here.

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.710
step and then we have this button here. Then we have this button and here we

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720
Then we have this button and here we

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.030
Then we have this button and here we have only our current step. When I click

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040
have only our current step. When I click

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.790
have only our current step. When I click at Facebook and submit we have now add

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800
at Facebook and submit we have now add

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.670
at Facebook and submit we have now add Twitter and we are in the Facebook step.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680
Twitter and we are in the Facebook step.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.549
Twitter and we are in the Facebook step. So this is different

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559
So this is different

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:56.230
So this is different with this switch.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.630
Okay. Anything else?

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640
Okay. Anything else?

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.150
Okay. Anything else? Okay. And um one more question. What

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160
Okay. And um one more question. What

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.030
Okay. And um one more question. What happens when we update workflow add

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040
happens when we update workflow add

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.740
happens when we update workflow add extra step? Uh

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:07.750
extra step? Uh

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.950
extra step? Uh [Music]

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.950
and uh what happens

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960
and uh what happens

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.430
and uh what happens to modify a workflow? You first need to

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440
to modify a workflow? You first need to

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.870
to modify a workflow? You first need to deactivate it. Here you saw that I'm now

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880
deactivate it. Here you saw that I'm now

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.270
deactivate it. Here you saw that I'm now in create workflow because I cannot edit

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280
in create workflow because I cannot edit

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.630
in create workflow because I cannot edit my current one because it's active. And

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640
my current one because it's active. And

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.470
my current one because it's active. And whenever you click this deactivate

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480
whenever you click this deactivate

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.710
whenever you click this deactivate button or workflows that are currently

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720
button or workflows that are currently

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.710
button or workflows that are currently started, oh, let me show you. I have now

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720
started, oh, let me show you. I have now

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.309
started, oh, let me show you. I have now started this workflow, right? It

00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319
started this workflow, right? It

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:33.750
started this workflow, right? It started. It's in the middle of

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760
started. It's in the middle of

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.109
started. It's in the middle of somewhere. And when I deactivate this

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119
somewhere. And when I deactivate this

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:39.430
somewhere. And when I deactivate this workflow,

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440
workflow,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.030
workflow, uh here I don't have it anymore. And

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040
uh here I don't have it anymore. And

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.750
uh here I don't have it anymore. And when I act now I can edit this edit

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760
when I act now I can edit this edit

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.349
when I act now I can edit this edit button was not available when this

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359
button was not available when this

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:49.510
button was not available when this workflow was active. And when you do the

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520
workflow was active. And when you do the

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.510
workflow was active. And when you do the edit for example add another step or

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520
edit for example add another step or

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.030
edit for example add another step or whatever and activate it back

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040
whatever and activate it back

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.510
whatever and activate it back then this workflow is reset. So the one

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520
then this workflow is reset. So the one

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.589
then this workflow is reset. So the one that was in the process is actually

00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599
that was in the process is actually

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:04.950
that was in the process is actually deleted.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.230
I need to start the workflow again. So

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240
I need to start the workflow again. So

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.549
I need to start the workflow again. So this previous is not available for me

00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559
this previous is not available for me

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:13.430
this previous is not available for me anymore here. Of course, I didn't lose

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440
anymore here. Of course, I didn't lose

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.150
anymore here. Of course, I didn't lose any data or anything that happened

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160
any data or anything that happened

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.309
any data or anything that happened through this previous workflow, right?

00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319
through this previous workflow, right?

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:20.470
through this previous workflow, right? So this data are still here, but I'm

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480
So this data are still here, but I'm

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.630
So this data are still here, but I'm just not able to continue this old

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640
just not able to continue this old

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.230
just not able to continue this old workflow because it's not relevant

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240
workflow because it's not relevant

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.710
workflow because it's not relevant anymore.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:34.309
Correct.

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:37.109
Um okay

00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119
Um okay

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.990
Um okay so let's check the definition it will be

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000
so let's check the definition it will be

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.990
so let's check the definition it will be inside the workflowsy file inside the or

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000
inside the workflowsy file inside the or

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.630
inside the workflowsy file inside the or subd directory of resources config so it

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640
subd directory of resources config so it

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.670
subd directory of resources config so it will be autoloaded by our workflows

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.670
actually in this case it will not be

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680
actually in this case it will not be

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.510
actually in this case it will not be autoloaded

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520
autoloaded

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.790
autoloaded uh because every time you do any change

00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800
uh because every time you do any change

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.990
uh because every time you do any change in this uh workflows yam you need to

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000
in this uh workflows yam you need to

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.910
in this uh workflows yam you need to additionally execute this command which

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920
additionally execute this command which

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.990
additionally execute this command which is called our workflow definitions load

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000
is called our workflow definitions load

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.030
is called our workflow definitions load and this command will read all those

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040
and this command will read all those

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.829
and this command will read all those files and apply appropriate changes to

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839
files and apply appropriate changes to

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:16.630
files and apply appropriate changes to database. Then uh in a database we have

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640
database. Then uh in a database we have

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.950
database. Then uh in a database we have this definition and application it's

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960
this definition and application it's

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.910
this definition and application it's loading it from a database. So behind

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920
loading it from a database. So behind

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.510
loading it from a database. So behind this there is a workflow definition

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520
this there is a workflow definition

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.069
this there is a workflow definition entity and it has its table in a

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079
entity and it has its table in a

00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:29.270
entity and it has its table in a database where we keep this definition

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280
database where we keep this definition

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.230
database where we keep this definition defined in the YAML file.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240
defined in the YAML file.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.950
defined in the YAML file. Uh there is also a way to debug existing

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960
Uh there is also a way to debug existing

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.349
Uh there is also a way to debug existing workflows uh in case you want to check

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359
workflows uh in case you want to check

00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:42.710
workflows uh in case you want to check uh what's there. And let me actually

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720
uh what's there. And let me actually

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:53.510
uh what's there. And let me actually execute this.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.750
Okay.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760
Okay.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:01.750
Okay. So,

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.069
okay. So, if I just execute the comment,

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079
okay. So, if I just execute the comment,

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:06.069
okay. So, if I just execute the comment, I will have a list of all the workflows

00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079
I will have a list of all the workflows

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:09.430
I will have a list of all the workflows that are available. And as you can see,

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440
that are available. And as you can see,

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.349
that are available. And as you can see, my workflow training uh workflow um

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359
my workflow training uh workflow um

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:16.630
my workflow training uh workflow um basically gets some

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640
basically gets some

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.670
basically gets some random numbers to make sure that the

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680
random numbers to make sure that the

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.829
random numbers to make sure that the name of the workflow is unique because

00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839
name of the workflow is unique because

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:23.270
name of the workflow is unique because the name of the workflow needs to be

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280
the name of the workflow needs to be

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.069
the name of the workflow needs to be unique. Uh then this is my label. This

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079
unique. Uh then this is my label. This

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:28.150
unique. Uh then this is my label. This is the entity that my workflow is bound

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160
is the entity that my workflow is bound

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.309
is the entity that my workflow is bound to. It's custom because I created it via

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319
to. It's custom because I created it via

00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:34.470
to. It's custom because I created it via the UI. Uh and it's for the back office.

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480
the UI. Uh and it's for the back office.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.109
the UI. Uh and it's for the back office. If you want details on your workflow,

00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119
If you want details on your workflow,

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:40.390
If you want details on your workflow, then you can add the workflow name at

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400
then you can add the workflow name at

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.349
then you can add the workflow name at the end of this command. And now we have

00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359
the end of this command. And now we have

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:46.309
the end of this command. And now we have all the definition. As you can see, for

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319
all the definition. As you can see, for

00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:49.510
all the definition. As you can see, for this small workflow, it's kind of long.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520
this small workflow, it's kind of long.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.190
this small workflow, it's kind of long. So we never use this command to copy

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200
So we never use this command to copy

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.510
So we never use this command to copy this to my YAN file because this is

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520
this to my YAN file because this is

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.510
this to my YAN file because this is exactly what we will create in the YAML

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520
exactly what we will create in the YAML

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.710
exactly what we will create in the YAML file manually from code. But it has a

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720
file manually from code. But it has a

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.910
file manually from code. But it has a lot of additional really not needed

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920
lot of additional really not needed

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.790
lot of additional really not needed elements here. It's like extremely too

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:06.800
elements here. It's like extremely too

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.950
elements here. It's like extremely too long. It has so many options that you

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960
long. It has so many options that you

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.990
long. It has so many options that you don't need to specify. So I will show

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000
don't need to specify. So I will show

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.069
don't need to specify. So I will show you in a moment a simple workflow that

00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079
you in a moment a simple workflow that

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:16.150
you in a moment a simple workflow that we have

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160
we have

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.549
we have in oral and you'll see that it will be

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559
in oral and you'll see that it will be

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:22.470
in oral and you'll see that it will be basically way shorter, way simpler and

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480
basically way shorter, way simpler and

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.349
basically way shorter, way simpler and easier to understand. Uh so I will not

00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359
easier to understand. Uh so I will not

00:55:25.359 --> 00:55:29.030
easier to understand. Uh so I will not explain you from here. I will explain

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040
explain you from here. I will explain

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.069
explain you from here. I will explain you on the real example. But in case you

00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079
you on the real example. But in case you

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:35.430
you on the real example. But in case you need to dump current workflow definition

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440
need to dump current workflow definition

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.390
need to dump current workflow definition to make sure that some change is there,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400
to make sure that some change is there,

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.549
to make sure that some change is there, uh this is how to do it.

00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559
uh this is how to do it.

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:45.910
uh this is how to do it. Okay. And then uh for this we have the

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920
Okay. And then uh for this we have the

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.150
Okay. And then uh for this we have the workflow definition entity that has its

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160
workflow definition entity that has its

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.309
workflow definition entity that has its table in a database. Uh so right now let

00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319
table in a database. Uh so right now let

00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:57.270
table in a database. Uh so right now let me switch

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.750
uh workflow

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.750
workflow definition

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.990
and I have all my workflows. This is the

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000
and I have all my workflows. This is the

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.670
and I have all my workflows. This is the one that I created and here uh the

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680
one that I created and here uh the

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.950
one that I created and here uh the configuration this is basically uh what

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960
configuration this is basically uh what

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.309
configuration this is basically uh what we saw here.

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319
we saw here.

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:21.190
we saw here. Okay. So it's kept uh it's serialized

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200
Okay. So it's kept uh it's serialized

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.390
Okay. So it's kept uh it's serialized and kept here in the configuration

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400
and kept here in the configuration

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.069
and kept here in the configuration um

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079
um

00:56:26.079 --> 00:56:28.309
um column.

00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319
column.

00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:33.109
column. Uh then we have uh separate translation

00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119
Uh then we have uh separate translation

00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:36.630
Uh then we have uh separate translation file for our workflows.

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640
file for our workflows.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.349
file for our workflows. So the translation file looks exactly

00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359
So the translation file looks exactly

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:41.990
So the translation file looks exactly the same like the message just here just

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000
the same like the message just here just

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.910
the same like the message just here just the domain name is different. So instead

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920
the domain name is different. So instead

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.109
the domain name is different. So instead of messages you need to have workflows

00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119
of messages you need to have workflows

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:50.630
of messages you need to have workflows then language then yam and for this we

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640
then language then yam and for this we

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.270
then language then yam and for this we actually are usually using the command

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280
actually are usually using the command

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.430
actually are usually using the command that is available to dump uh

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440
that is available to dump uh

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.030
that is available to dump uh translations for our workflow. Uh so

00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040
translations for our workflow. Uh so

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.510
translations for our workflow. Uh so after we create a workflow and load it

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520
after we create a workflow and load it

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.829
after we create a workflow and load it then we dump translation because that's

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839
then we dump translation because that's

00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:05.910
then we dump translation because that's the fastest way to create translation

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920
the fastest way to create translation

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.950
the fastest way to create translation file. And this command is also

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960
file. And this command is also

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.230
file. And this command is also generating some unnecessary data, but

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240
generating some unnecessary data, but

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.510
generating some unnecessary data, but it's easier to go from here than try to

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520
it's easier to go from here than try to

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.510
it's easier to go from here than try to figure out what your translation strings

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520
figure out what your translation strings

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.990
figure out what your translation strings needs to be.

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000
needs to be.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.349
needs to be. Okay. So, let's

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359
Okay. So, let's

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:27.109
Okay. So, let's let me do it for

00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119
let me do it for

00:57:27.119 --> 00:57:29.109
let me do it for my workflow.

00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119
my workflow.

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:31.990
my workflow. Okay. And this will be my translation

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000
Okay. And this will be my translation

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.190
Okay. And this will be my translation file. It's actually short. Uh but

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200
file. It's actually short. Uh but

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.950
file. It's actually short. Uh but basically all you need to specify is

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960
basically all you need to specify is

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.910
basically all you need to specify is labels. Uh button label will be a label

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920
labels. Uh button label will be a label

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.430
labels. Uh button label will be a label if you don't specify uh different. So

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440
if you don't specify uh different. So

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.510
if you don't specify uh different. So all those elements you can basically

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520
all those elements you can basically

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.309
all those elements you can basically remove. And this is how to start

00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319
remove. And this is how to start

00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:54.950
remove. And this is how to start creating your translation.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.309
Mhm.

00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319
Mhm.

00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:57.910
Mhm. There's some technical reason why it's

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920
There's some technical reason why it's

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.069
There's some technical reason why it's in a separate translation file or does

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079
in a separate translation file or does

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:02.069
in a separate translation file or does that is that just a decision that was

00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079
that is that just a decision that was

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:03.670
that is that just a decision that was made?

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680
made?

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.030
made? Um the reason is basically to not have

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040
Um the reason is basically to not have

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.190
Um the reason is basically to not have so big translation files and that's it

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200
so big translation files and that's it

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.670
so big translation files and that's it because the messages yam file it's

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680
because the messages yam file it's

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.510
because the messages yam file it's already very very big. There are only

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520
already very very big. There are only

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.589
already very very big. There are only some parts that we divide it in separate

00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599
some parts that we divide it in separate

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.829
some parts that we divide it in separate files like workflows. We have JS

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839
files like workflows. We have JS

00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:20.470
files like workflows. We have JS messages but still messages yam files

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480
messages but still messages yam files

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.430
messages but still messages yam files can be really really big. So that's just

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440
can be really really big. So that's just

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.390
can be really really big. So that's just some decision that we want to have it in

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400
some decision that we want to have it in

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.190
some decision that we want to have it in different domain name.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200
different domain name.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.589
different domain name. So just an organizational thing.

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:37.670
Um okay and as you saw I could and I

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680
Um okay and as you saw I could and I

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.270
Um okay and as you saw I could and I actually added simple definition from

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280
actually added simple definition from

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.750
actually added simple definition from the UI but uh I was very restricted with

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760
the UI but uh I was very restricted with

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.789
the UI but uh I was very restricted with options. There's nothing really fun uh

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799
options. There's nothing really fun uh

00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:48.630
options. There's nothing really fun uh with adding it via the UI because they

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640
with adding it via the UI because they

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.109
with adding it via the UI because they cannot do almost anything. Um and we as

00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119
cannot do almost anything. Um and we as

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:54.950
cannot do almost anything. Um and we as developers will add those definitions

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960
developers will add those definitions

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.150
developers will add those definitions from YAML file

00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160
from YAML file

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.789
from YAML file and the example that we are talk about

00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799
and the example that we are talk about

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:03.829
and the example that we are talk about it's uh opportunity flow. So we have a

00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839
it's uh opportunity flow. So we have a

00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:08.230
it's uh opportunity flow. So we have a workflow on our opportunity um entity

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240
workflow on our opportunity um entity

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.150
workflow on our opportunity um entity and I will show you all those elements

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160
and I will show you all those elements

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:14.069
and I will show you all those elements one by one in a moment uh as well as the

00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079
one by one in a moment uh as well as the

00:59:14.079 --> 00:59:17.670
one by one in a moment uh as well as the whole definition. So we'll get to this

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680
whole definition. So we'll get to this

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.630
whole definition. So we'll get to this element in a second.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640
element in a second.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.870
element in a second. Uh let me just tell you one last thing

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880
Uh let me just tell you one last thing

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.150
Uh let me just tell you one last thing before we do it. Uh whenever you click

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160
before we do it. Uh whenever you click

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.630
before we do it. Uh whenever you click the button to start the workflow behind

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640
the button to start the workflow behind

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.789
the button to start the workflow behind the scenes there is a workflow item uh

00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799
the scenes there is a workflow item uh

00:59:32.799 --> 00:59:35.829
the scenes there is a workflow item uh created for you. So this workflow item

00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839
created for you. So this workflow item

00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:39.349
created for you. So this workflow item represents our the state of our entity

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359
represents our the state of our entity

00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:45.190
represents our the state of our entity in current workflow. Okay. So it stores

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200
in current workflow. Okay. So it stores

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.510
in current workflow. Okay. So it stores all the data not related to entity. So

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520
all the data not related to entity. So

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.910
all the data not related to entity. So our workflow is bound to some entity. So

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920
our workflow is bound to some entity. So

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.630
our workflow is bound to some entity. So we kind of have this entity there and if

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640
we kind of have this entity there and if

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.470
we kind of have this entity there and if you want to have some additional data

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480
you want to have some additional data

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.030
you want to have some additional data except the entity that this workflow is

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040
except the entity that this workflow is

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.349
except the entity that this workflow is started for and then they are all kept

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359
started for and then they are all kept

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:05.030
started for and then they are all kept in the workflow item uh entity. It has a

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040
in the workflow item uh entity. It has a

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.829
in the workflow item uh entity. It has a data field and inside those data we keep

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839
data field and inside those data we keep

01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:10.549
data field and inside those data we keep all the additional information and this

01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559
all the additional information and this

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:13.190
all the additional information and this data field is serialized and there is a

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200
data field is serialized and there is a

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.150
data field is serialized and there is a workflow item entity behind this. Uh so

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160
workflow item entity behind this. Uh so

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.870
workflow item entity behind this. Uh so we do have also a table for this. So I

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880
we do have also a table for this. So I

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.789
we do have also a table for this. So I started already the workflow for

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799
started already the workflow for

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:29.190
started already the workflow for Deborah. So let's check workflow items.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.390
Okay. Workflow items.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400
Okay. Workflow items.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:38.230
Okay. Workflow items. The

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.150
Uhhuh.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.470
The the last one

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.910
I was here. Okay, something is not

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920
I was here. Okay, something is not

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.630
I was here. Okay, something is not correct for me.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640
correct for me.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.270
correct for me. Just let me check it.

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280
Just let me check it.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.870
Just let me check it. Looks like it's back to the init step.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880
Looks like it's back to the init step.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.270
Looks like it's back to the init step. Or does it not clear those out when you

01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280
Or does it not clear those out when you

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.069
Or does it not clear those out when you finish the workflow?

01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079
finish the workflow?

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:05.510
finish the workflow? Ah, because I deactivated it. Okay, so I

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520
Ah, because I deactivated it. Okay, so I

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.309
Ah, because I deactivated it. Okay, so I need to Yeah, good catch.

01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319
need to Yeah, good catch.

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:11.510
need to Yeah, good catch. Let's start it and let's actually go

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520
Let's start it and let's actually go

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.549
Let's start it and let's actually go somewhere.

01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:20.630
Okay. So now I have my workflow item. So

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640
Okay. So now I have my workflow item. So

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.309
Okay. So now I have my workflow item. So this is the one uh this is my workflow

01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319
this is the one uh this is my workflow

01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:28.230
this is the one uh this is my workflow name. It's bound to entity contact ID

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240
name. It's bound to entity contact ID

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.030
name. It's bound to entity contact ID 52. And this is exactly where we are at.

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040
52. And this is exactly where we are at.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.789
52. And this is exactly where we are at. And

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799
And

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:37.109
And what we have more we don't have any

01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119
what we have more we don't have any

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:41.510
what we have more we don't have any additional data. And we are in step 53.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520
additional data. And we are in step 53.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.390
additional data. And we are in step 53. Um, so let's

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.270
check uh steps

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280
check uh steps

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.270
check uh steps 53. It's uh step Facebook and it seems

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280
53. It's uh step Facebook and it seems

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.270
53. It's uh step Facebook and it seems that it's correct because I'm on a

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280
that it's correct because I'm on a

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.349
that it's correct because I'm on a Facebook step.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359
Facebook step.

01:01:59.359 --> 01:02:02.069
Facebook step. So that's that's happening behind the

01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079
So that's that's happening behind the

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:04.870
So that's that's happening behind the scenes. This workflow item was created

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880
scenes. This workflow item was created

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.069
scenes. This workflow item was created for me and it keeps the current state of

01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079
for me and it keeps the current state of

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:14.470
for me and it keeps the current state of my entity in this particular workflow.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.670
Okay. So, how to define the uh workflow?

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680
Okay. So, how to define the uh workflow?

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.470
Okay. So, how to define the uh workflow? Yes.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480
Yes.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.510
Yes. Is that workflow item tied to that the

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520
Is that workflow item tied to that the

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.349
Is that workflow item tied to that the specific user as well or is it shared?

01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359
specific user as well or is it shared?

01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:28.390
specific user as well or is it shared? No, it's shared.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400
No, it's shared.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.910
No, it's shared. Okay. So, anybody that goes to that

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920
Okay. So, anybody that goes to that

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.150
Okay. So, anybody that goes to that contact will see this workflow in the

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160
contact will see this workflow in the

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:32.630
contact will see this workflow in the current state

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640
current state

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.750
current state in the same state.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760
in the same state.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.589
in the same state. Okay.

01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599
Okay.

01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:37.910
Okay. It's global, not per user. Workflows are

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920
It's global, not per user. Workflows are

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.270
It's global, not per user. Workflows are global, not per user.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280
global, not per user.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.630
global, not per user. Okay. That would be actually

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640
Okay. That would be actually

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.309
Okay. That would be actually maybe not customization but

01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319
maybe not customization but

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:47.910
maybe not customization but it could be problematic.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920
it could be problematic.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.750
it could be problematic. It couldn't be problematic because

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760
It couldn't be problematic because

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.829
It couldn't be problematic because usually we use workflows because we for

01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839
usually we use workflows because we for

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:53.910
usually we use workflows because we for example want some person with particular

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920
example want some person with particular

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.030
example want some person with particular role to be able to transit it uh at the

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.040
role to be able to transit it uh at the

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.589
role to be able to transit it uh at the beginning to fill some data and then the

01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599
beginning to fill some data and then the

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.670
beginning to fill some data and then the other person to continue this workflow

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680
other person to continue this workflow

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.190
other person to continue this workflow and do something more.

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200
and do something more.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.510
and do something more. Yeah.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520
Yeah.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.990
Yeah. So this is the main kind of idea behind

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000
So this is the main kind of idea behind

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.589
So this is the main kind of idea behind the workflow. That's why it's like

01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599
the workflow. That's why it's like

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.030
the workflow. That's why it's like global not per user.

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.040
global not per user.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.950
global not per user. Okay. I just wanted to verify that.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960
Okay. I just wanted to verify that.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.750
Okay. I just wanted to verify that. Okay.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760
Okay.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.069
Okay. Yeah, sure.

01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079
Yeah, sure.

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:16.630
Yeah, sure. Uh okay. So, first if you want to create

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640
Uh okay. So, first if you want to create

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.630
Uh okay. So, first if you want to create the workflow uh we need you need to add

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640
the workflow uh we need you need to add

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.750
the workflow uh we need you need to add the workflow yam file. As you can see,

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760
the workflow yam file. As you can see,

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.630
the workflow yam file. As you can see, we never put the whole definition in the

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640
we never put the whole definition in the

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.910
we never put the whole definition in the main file because uh

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920
main file because uh

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.150
main file because uh you can have multiple multiple workflows

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160
you can have multiple multiple workflows

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.549
you can have multiple multiple workflows in one bundle and then this main file

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559
in one bundle and then this main file

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:37.910
in one bundle and then this main file will be just a mess. And the second uh

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920
will be just a mess. And the second uh

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.910
will be just a mess. And the second uh issue is purely developer.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920
issue is purely developer.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.510
issue is purely developer. It's because our awesome Oro plug-in

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520
It's because our awesome Oro plug-in

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.910
It's because our awesome Oro plug-in doesn't work in workflow file. It's

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920
doesn't work in workflow file. It's

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.870
doesn't work in workflow file. It's highlighting it with an errors and if

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880
highlighting it with an errors and if

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.069
highlighting it with an errors and if you use uh imports then uh it works.

01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079
you use uh imports then uh it works.

01:03:56.079 --> 01:04:02.630
you use uh imports then uh it works. Okay. So

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.870
flow let me find this in code.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.549
Okay. So how this works first inside

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559
Okay. So how this works first inside

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:15.829
Okay. So how this works first inside resources config oro we have a workflow

01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839
resources config oro we have a workflow

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:18.950
resources config oro we have a workflow yl file and if I had this in my bundle

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960
yl file and if I had this in my bundle

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.950
yl file and if I had this in my bundle you'll see that IDE will highlight this

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960
you'll see that IDE will highlight this

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.230
you'll see that IDE will highlight this whole file for you. It will be

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240
whole file for you. It will be

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.109
whole file for you. It will be unreadable. Uh so here we basically

01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119
unreadable. Uh so here we basically

01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:27.990
unreadable. Uh so here we basically actually in our sales bundle we already

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000
actually in our sales bundle we already

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.069
actually in our sales bundle we already have two workflows. So putting the

01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079
have two workflows. So putting the

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:33.990
have two workflows. So putting the definitions here is just a mess. Uh so

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000
definitions here is just a mess. Uh so

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.950
definitions here is just a mess. Uh so we are basically um adding definitions

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960
we are basically um adding definitions

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.750
we are basically um adding definitions in separate files and here just

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760
in separate files and here just

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.910
in separate files and here just importing those files. So for the

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920
importing those files. So for the

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.710
importing those files. So for the opportunity flow uh this is how we

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720
opportunity flow uh this is how we

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.589
opportunity flow uh this is how we define a workflow. This workflow's name

01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599
define a workflow. This workflow's name

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:50.230
define a workflow. This workflow's name space can be put directly in here.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240
space can be put directly in here.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.829
space can be put directly in here. Right? So I can paste it here.

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839
Right? So I can paste it here.

01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:56.630
Right? So I can paste it here. So in the workflows name space you need

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640
So in the workflows name space you need

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.109
So in the workflows name space you need to specify a workflow. Here is the name

01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119
to specify a workflow. Here is the name

01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.630
to specify a workflow. Here is the name of your workflow. This needs to be

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640
of your workflow. This needs to be

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.990
of your workflow. This needs to be unique globally unique. Uh and if you

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000
unique globally unique. Uh and if you

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.109
unique globally unique. Uh and if you try to load this file with the command

01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119
try to load this file with the command

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:10.230
try to load this file with the command and you will create a duplicate name it

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240
and you will create a duplicate name it

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.230
and you will create a duplicate name it will just throw you an error and tell

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240
will just throw you an error and tell

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.750
will just throw you an error and tell you that this workflow already exists.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760
you that this workflow already exists.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.710
you that this workflow already exists. Um so you need to name your workflow

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720
Um so you need to name your workflow

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.029
Um so you need to name your workflow whatever you like. Remember it needs to

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039
whatever you like. Remember it needs to

01:05:21.039 --> 01:05:23.510
whatever you like. Remember it needs to be unique. Then our workflow is always

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520
be unique. Then our workflow is always

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.150
be unique. Then our workflow is always bound to some entity. In this case, this

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160
bound to some entity. In this case, this

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.510
bound to some entity. In this case, this is an opportunity entity. Uh our

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520
is an opportunity entity. Uh our

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.109
is an opportunity entity. Uh our workflow will will uh can have some

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119
workflow will will uh can have some

01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:35.510
workflow will will uh can have some additional data. But most of all, it has

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520
additional data. But most of all, it has

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.069
additional data. But most of all, it has our entity as uh an attribute. So you

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079
our entity as uh an attribute. So you

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:43.910
our entity as uh an attribute. So you can reach our opportunity

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920
can reach our opportunity

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.150
can reach our opportunity when the workflow is happening. So we

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160
when the workflow is happening. So we

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.950
when the workflow is happening. So we need to specify the name of this

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960
need to specify the name of this

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.589
need to specify the name of this attribute and our entity will be

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599
attribute and our entity will be

01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:54.950
attribute and our entity will be available under this name. Okay. Uh

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960
available under this name. Okay. Uh

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.750
available under this name. Okay. Uh start step and in case you need some

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760
start step and in case you need some

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.309
start step and in case you need some exclusive active groups or uh record

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319
exclusive active groups or uh record

01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:03.670
exclusive active groups or uh record groups this is how you can specify it.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680
groups this is how you can specify it.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.190
groups this is how you can specify it. Uh also you can specify to enable

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200
Uh also you can specify to enable

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.750
Uh also you can specify to enable uh workflow by default.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:19.430
Um sure if I can find easy example

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440
Um sure if I can find easy example

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.589
Um sure if I can find easy example anywhere here.

01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:25.910
Uh okay

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920
Uh okay

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.109
Uh okay that's it. Defaults active true. So

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119
that's it. Defaults active true. So

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.029
that's it. Defaults active true. So whenever you will load this workflow

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039
whenever you will load this workflow

01:06:31.039 --> 01:06:33.029
whenever you will load this workflow with uh the command it will be

01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039
with uh the command it will be

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:36.069
with uh the command it will be automatically activated.

01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079
automatically activated.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.870
automatically activated. Uh applications default means uh back

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880
Uh applications default means uh back

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.710
Uh applications default means uh back office. If you don't specify anything,

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720
office. If you don't specify anything,

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.750
office. If you don't specify anything, it will be um back office by default.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760
it will be um back office by default.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.589
it will be um back office by default. And then we need to specify other

01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599
And then we need to specify other

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:50.309
And then we need to specify other elements. Uh and basically you can put

01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319
elements. Uh and basically you can put

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:52.789
elements. Uh and basically you can put them all here if you're sure that your

01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799
them all here if you're sure that your

01:06:52.799 --> 01:06:56.069
them all here if you're sure that your workflow is short. But if you prefer you

01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079
workflow is short. But if you prefer you

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:59.270
workflow is short. But if you prefer you can also put them in separate files and

01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280
can also put them in separate files and

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.390
can also put them in separate files and import here. So all those files accept

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400
import here. So all those files accept

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.470
import here. So all those files accept imports.

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480
imports.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.109
imports. Okay. So regarding the defining the

01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119
Okay. So regarding the defining the

01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:10.710
Okay. So regarding the defining the workflow that's it and now we will talk

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720
workflow that's it and now we will talk

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.470
workflow that's it and now we will talk about all those elements

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480
about all those elements

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.109
about all those elements like steps attributes and so on.

01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119
like steps attributes and so on.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.670
like steps attributes and so on. Okay. So step uh this is a state of our

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680
Okay. So step uh this is a state of our

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.510
Okay. So step uh this is a state of our workflow. Behind this there is a

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520
workflow. Behind this there is a

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.950
workflow. Behind this there is a workflow step entity steps uh are

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960
workflow step entity steps uh are

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.829
workflow step entity steps uh are ordered and they know about possible

01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839
ordered and they know about possible

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:32.309
ordered and they know about possible transition from the step to some other.

01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319
transition from the step to some other.

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:34.390
transition from the step to some other. So step doesn't know anything about the

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400
So step doesn't know anything about the

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.430
So step doesn't know anything about the transition that leads to it but uh knows

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440
transition that leads to it but uh knows

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.750
transition that leads to it but uh knows everything about available forward

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760
everything about available forward

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.510
everything about available forward transitions

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520
transitions

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.750
transitions and workflow may have one step start

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760
and workflow may have one step start

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.950
and workflow may have one step start step and uh many final steps and uh let

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960
step and uh many final steps and uh let

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.870
step and uh many final steps and uh let me open the steps file.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880
me open the steps file.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.630
me open the steps file. So how to define a steps under workflows

01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640
So how to define a steps under workflows

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.069
So how to define a steps under workflows namespace? This is the name of my

01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079
namespace? This is the name of my

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:03.190
namespace? This is the name of my workflow exactly the same as here on the

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200
workflow exactly the same as here on the

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.430
workflow exactly the same as here on the level that we specified entity and

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440
level that we specified entity and

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.270
level that we specified entity and others the same level we specify steps

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280
others the same level we specify steps

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.829
others the same level we specify steps section and in the steps section you can

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839
section and in the steps section you can

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:14.870
section and in the steps section you can specify as many steps as you want. Uh

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880
specify as many steps as you want. Uh

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.870
specify as many steps as you want. Uh this is the step name. So this is

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880
this is the step name. So this is

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.829
this is the step name. So this is important. You need to name it um I mean

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839
important. You need to name it um I mean

01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:23.590
important. You need to name it um I mean you can name it as you like but later on

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600
you can name it as you like but later on

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.510
you can name it as you like but later on uh this will be treated also as an

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520
uh this will be treated also as an

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.910
uh this will be treated also as an identifier for this step. So this is our

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920
identifier for this step. So this is our

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.149
identifier for this step. So this is our name. Then you can specify order

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159
name. Then you can specify order

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:35.189
name. Then you can specify order and uh you can specify allowed

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199
and uh you can specify allowed

01:08:35.199 --> 01:08:37.990
and uh you can specify allowed transitions. Right now we don't have uh

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000
transitions. Right now we don't have uh

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.590
transitions. Right now we don't have uh we didn't define transitions yet.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600
we didn't define transitions yet.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.510
we didn't define transitions yet. Um

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520
Um

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.070
Um so actually first you create steps then

01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080
so actually first you create steps then

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.829
so actually first you create steps then you create transitions and then you

01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839
you create transitions and then you

01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:50.229
you create transitions and then you specify which transitions are available

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239
specify which transitions are available

01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:53.510
specify which transitions are available from this step. So from step order I

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520
from this step. So from step order I

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.590
from this step. So from step order I will uh I have three available

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600
will uh I have three available

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.390
will uh I have three available transitions. So I will have actually

01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400
transitions. So I will have actually

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.510
transitions. So I will have actually three buttons on my entity and as you

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520
three buttons on my entity and as you

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.749
three buttons on my entity and as you can see we are trying to name the steps

01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759
can see we are trying to name the steps

01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:05.990
can see we are trying to name the steps and the transitions the way that

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000
and the transitions the way that

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.309
and the transitions the way that actually by the name I will tell you

01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319
actually by the name I will tell you

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:11.510
actually by the name I will tell you what it's doing. So from open I have

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520
what it's doing. So from open I have

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.510
what it's doing. So from open I have develop. So here actually maybe it's not

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520
develop. So here actually maybe it's not

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.269
develop. So here actually maybe it's not so obvious what it's doing. So probably

01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279
so obvious what it's doing. So probably

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:19.510
so obvious what it's doing. So probably it's just filling uh data but close one

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520
it's just filling uh data but close one

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.749
it's just filling uh data but close one I'm pretty sure that this is step uh

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759
I'm pretty sure that this is step uh

01:09:21.759 --> 01:09:23.910
I'm pretty sure that this is step uh this is transition that leads from open

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920
this is transition that leads from open

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.349
this is transition that leads from open to one close lost this is from open to

01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359
to one close lost this is from open to

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:30.229
to one close lost this is from open to lost and uh from one and lost we have

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239
lost and uh from one and lost we have

01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:33.189
lost and uh from one and lost we have reopen transitions which are probably

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199
reopen transitions which are probably

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:36.229
reopen transitions which are probably going back to open. And I will tell you

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239
going back to open. And I will tell you

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.829
going back to open. And I will tell you that I will show you those definitions

01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839
that I will show you those definitions

01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:43.349
that I will show you those definitions uh in a second. So you will see exactly

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359
uh in a second. So you will see exactly

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.910
uh in a second. So you will see exactly to which step this transition leads to.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920
to which step this transition leads to.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.870
to which step this transition leads to. Okay. So we have three steps

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880
Okay. So we have three steps

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.789
Okay. So we have three steps and we have allowed transitions from

01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799
and we have allowed transitions from

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:52.149
and we have allowed transitions from this step. Here I will have three

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159
this step. Here I will have three

01:09:52.159 --> 01:09:55.830
this step. Here I will have three buttons. Here only one and here only uh

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840
buttons. Here only one and here only uh

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.990
buttons. Here only one and here only uh one reopen button and that's it. Easy.

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000
one reopen button and that's it. Easy.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.430
one reopen button and that's it. Easy. Uh then we have attributes. Uh so uh as

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440
Uh then we have attributes. Uh so uh as

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.030
Uh then we have attributes. Uh so uh as you remember when I was uh creating the

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040
you remember when I was uh creating the

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.669
you remember when I was uh creating the workflow from the UI, I also added a

01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679
workflow from the UI, I also added a

01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:15.110
workflow from the UI, I also added a form popup and there were inputs for

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120
form popup and there were inputs for

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.750
form popup and there were inputs for Facebook and Twitter there. Uh so in

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760
Facebook and Twitter there. Uh so in

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.990
Facebook and Twitter there. Uh so in order to be able to manipulate data

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000
order to be able to manipulate data

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.270
order to be able to manipulate data during the workflow is happening. Um you

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280
during the workflow is happening. Um you

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.189
during the workflow is happening. Um you need to put those values to the

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199
need to put those values to the

01:10:27.199 --> 01:10:29.350
need to put those values to the attributes section. So in order to be

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360
attributes section. So in order to be

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.149
attributes section. So in order to be able to edit Facebook value, I need to

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159
able to edit Facebook value, I need to

01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:35.110
able to edit Facebook value, I need to edit this Facebook uh as an attribute.

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120
edit this Facebook uh as an attribute.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.510
edit this Facebook uh as an attribute. So this attributes are data of my

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520
So this attributes are data of my

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.669
So this attributes are data of my workflow and I will be able to work on

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679
workflow and I will be able to work on

01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:42.709
workflow and I will be able to work on with this data during uh the workflow.

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719
with this data during uh the workflow.

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:46.229
with this data during uh the workflow. Uh and we have entity and our entity

01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239
Uh and we have entity and our entity

01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:48.630
Uh and we have entity and our entity fields and we also have some can have

01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640
fields and we also have some can have

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.550
fields and we also have some can have some additional uh data and this will be

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560
some additional uh data and this will be

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.310
some additional uh data and this will be stored in the workflow item.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320
stored in the workflow item.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.229
stored in the workflow item. Um so my attributes in when I define

01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239
Um so my attributes in when I define

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.790
Um so my attributes in when I define attributes I can say that it's referring

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800
attributes I can say that it's referring

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.830
attributes I can say that it's referring to a field on my entity or it can be

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840
to a field on my entity or it can be

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.510
to a field on my entity or it can be just some not related to entity

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520
just some not related to entity

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.189
just some not related to entity attribute

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199
attribute

01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:14.229
attribute example

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:15.910
again we are under the workflows

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920
again we are under the workflows

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.709
again we are under the workflows namespace and under the opportunity flow

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719
namespace and under the opportunity flow

01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:20.950
namespace and under the opportunity flow workflow. This is the same here and on

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960
workflow. This is the same here and on

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.950
workflow. This is the same here and on the same level as entity as steps we

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960
the same level as entity as steps we

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.590
the same level as entity as steps we have another section called attributes

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600
have another section called attributes

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.630
have another section called attributes and here we specify all the attributes.

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640
and here we specify all the attributes.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.910
and here we specify all the attributes. So those are attribute names and if you

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920
So those are attribute names and if you

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.669
So those are attribute names and if you specify property path to existing field

01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679
specify property path to existing field

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:41.430
specify property path to existing field on my entity then under this attribute I

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440
on my entity then under this attribute I

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.750
on my entity then under this attribute I will actually have a value from my

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760
will actually have a value from my

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.149
will actually have a value from my entity. But you can create like this

01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159
entity. But you can create like this

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:48.550
entity. But you can create like this close username which is not related to

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560
close username which is not related to

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.709
close username which is not related to any value on the entity. It's just

01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719
any value on the entity. It's just

01:11:50.719 --> 01:11:53.910
any value on the entity. It's just basically a string. You'll be able to uh

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920
basically a string. You'll be able to uh

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.709
basically a string. You'll be able to uh fill this with some value. But this will

01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719
fill this with some value. But this will

01:11:56.719 --> 01:11:58.709
fill this with some value. But this will not be like automatically saved

01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719
not be like automatically saved

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:02.310
not be like automatically saved anywhere. And this goes to my field on

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320
anywhere. And this goes to my field on

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.950
anywhere. And this goes to my field on my entity. So I'll be able actually with

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960
my entity. So I'll be able actually with

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.270
my entity. So I'll be able actually with this attribute to edit a field on my

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280
this attribute to edit a field on my

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.870
this attribute to edit a field on my entity.

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880
entity.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.709
entity. And that's the only difference. So

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719
And that's the only difference. So

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:13.510
And that's the only difference. So either property path or just basically

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520
either property path or just basically

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.550
either property path or just basically some standalone attribute not linked to

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560
some standalone attribute not linked to

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.550
some standalone attribute not linked to my entity.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.830
Uh yeah

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840
Uh yeah

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.669
Uh yeah sorry. So um can we assign multiple

01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679
sorry. So um can we assign multiple

01:12:27.679 --> 01:12:31.270
sorry. So um can we assign multiple entities to this or only one?

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280
entities to this or only one?

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.070
entities to this or only one? No workflow is bound only on to one

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080
No workflow is bound only on to one

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.709
No workflow is bound only on to one entity. So the idea of workflow is to um

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719
entity. So the idea of workflow is to um

01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:44.790
entity. So the idea of workflow is to um process some entity through states.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.229
Okay. So if it is customer and addresses

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239
Okay. So if it is customer and addresses

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:51.830
Okay. So if it is customer and addresses uh addresses are part of the customer we

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840
uh addresses are part of the customer we

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.510
uh addresses are part of the customer we should um

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520
should um

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.510
should um you have a getter for addresses. So if

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520
you have a getter for addresses. So if

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.590
you have a getter for addresses. So if you have a workflow on the customer

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600
you have a workflow on the customer

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.750
you have a workflow on the customer entity then basically you have all the

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760
entity then basically you have all the

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:08.870
entity then basically you have all the customer fields addresses as well.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.470
Yeah. So, it sounds like if you want to

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480
Yeah. So, it sounds like if you want to

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.350
Yeah. So, it sounds like if you want to kind of have a workflow, manage multiple

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360
kind of have a workflow, manage multiple

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.070
kind of have a workflow, manage multiple entities, it's possible as long as

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080
entities, it's possible as long as

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.470
entities, it's possible as long as they've got a relationship defined. Is

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480
they've got a relationship defined. Is

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.550
they've got a relationship defined. Is that sort of the idea? It's always you

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560
that sort of the idea? It's always you

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.870
that sort of the idea? It's always you always need to think about workflow that

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880
always need to think about workflow that

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.830
always need to think about workflow that is changing one entity and if the

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840
is changing one entity and if the

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.310
is changing one entity and if the process of changing this entity requires

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320
process of changing this entity requires

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.750
process of changing this entity requires you to create uh a case or opportunity

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760
you to create uh a case or opportunity

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.229
you to create uh a case or opportunity in the process then we're actually

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239
in the process then we're actually

01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:36.310
in the process then we're actually handling this uh in the transition

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320
handling this uh in the transition

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.550
handling this uh in the transition definitions. I will show you in a moment

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560
definitions. I will show you in a moment

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.870
definitions. I will show you in a moment that you can do pretty much anything

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880
that you can do pretty much anything

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.270
that you can do pretty much anything there because we have there a list of

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280
there because we have there a list of

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.229
there because we have there a list of actions that will be happening and this

01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239
actions that will be happening and this

01:13:46.239 --> 01:13:48.149
actions that will be happening and this behind this there is a PHP code so you

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159
behind this there is a PHP code so you

01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:50.709
behind this there is a PHP code so you can seriously do pretty much anything.

01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719
can seriously do pretty much anything.

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:55.110
can seriously do pretty much anything. Uh so um so basically it's bumped to one

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120
Uh so um so basically it's bumped to one

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.350
Uh so um so basically it's bumped to one entity but in when transition is

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360
entity but in when transition is

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.110
entity but in when transition is happening you can do all the magic you

01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120
happening you can do all the magic you

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.709
happening you can do all the magic you need.

01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719
need.

01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:02.229
need. Okay. Yeah, that'll be interesting to

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239
Okay. Yeah, that'll be interesting to

01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:04.390
Okay. Yeah, that'll be interesting to see how that looks.

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400
see how that looks.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.189
see how that looks. Mhm.

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199
Mhm.

01:14:07.199 --> 01:14:10.229
Mhm. So basically the definition uh for the

01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239
So basically the definition uh for the

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:12.550
So basically the definition uh for the steps is simple

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560
steps is simple

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.229
steps is simple uh for the transition will also be very

01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239
uh for the transition will also be very

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:17.830
uh for the transition will also be very simple but you will see that in

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840
simple but you will see that in

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.229
simple but you will see that in transition transition definition you can

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239
transition transition definition you can

01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:27.430
transition transition definition you can do like anything.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.990
Okay. So how to reach the attributes? Uh

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000
Okay. So how to reach the attributes? Uh

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.830
Okay. So how to reach the attributes? Uh for example in the transition

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840
for example in the transition

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.550
for example in the transition definitions or anywhere in the workflow.

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560
definitions or anywhere in the workflow.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.390
definitions or anywhere in the workflow. Uh so all those attributes are um

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400
Uh so all those attributes are um

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.709
Uh so all those attributes are um available via the data container. Okay.

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719
available via the data container. Okay.

01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:44.550
available via the data container. Okay. So we have data container and we have

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560
So we have data container and we have

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.430
So we have data container and we have the status attribute. Then you can use

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440
the status attribute. Then you can use

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.510
the status attribute. Then you can use the shortened version. This is this one.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520
the shortened version. This is this one.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.590
the shortened version. This is this one. But do not use this version with a dot

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600
But do not use this version with a dot

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.750
But do not use this version with a dot because this dot will trying to fetch a

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760
because this dot will trying to fetch a

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.790
because this dot will trying to fetch a status variable on our workflow item. So

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800
status variable on our workflow item. So

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.709
status variable on our workflow item. So we have data variable on our workflow

01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719
we have data variable on our workflow

01:14:58.719 --> 01:15:01.510
we have data variable on our workflow item uh you saw this column in the

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520
item uh you saw this column in the

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.830
item uh you saw this column in the database even but we don't have a status

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840
database even but we don't have a status

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.030
database even but we don't have a status so you will see exception. So the

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040
so you will see exception. So the

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.870
so you will see exception. So the shortened version to fetch some data

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880
shortened version to fetch some data

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.229
shortened version to fetch some data attribute it's this one without a dot.

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239
attribute it's this one without a dot.

01:15:14.239 --> 01:15:18.390
attribute it's this one without a dot. Then um on our workflow item we always

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400
Then um on our workflow item we always

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.709
Then um on our workflow item we always have some one additional container which

01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719
have some one additional container which

01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:23.270
have some one additional container which is called result and this is here for

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280
is called result and this is here for

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.229
is called result and this is here for temporary data. So in case you need some

01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239
temporary data. So in case you need some

01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:29.030
temporary data. So in case you need some um when the transition will be happening

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040
um when the transition will be happening

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.870
um when the transition will be happening and you will be doing some custom C

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880
and you will be doing some custom C

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.350
and you will be doing some custom C calculations or some custom business

01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360
calculations or some custom business

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.390
calculations or some custom business logic and you need somewhere to put uh

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400
logic and you need somewhere to put uh

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.270
logic and you need somewhere to put uh temporary data because your next action

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280
temporary data because your next action

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.070
temporary data because your next action is basing on this then this is exactly

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080
is basing on this then this is exactly

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.870
is basing on this then this is exactly the place that you can use. Those data

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880
the place that you can use. Those data

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.310
the place that you can use. Those data will not be saved anywhere. Uh so it's

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320
will not be saved anywhere. Uh so it's

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.110
will not be saved anywhere. Uh so it's available only in your transition when

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120
available only in your transition when

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.310
available only in your transition when you already transit to a next step.

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320
you already transit to a next step.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.430
you already transit to a next step. this con container is emptied.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.790
Um and according to and also connected

01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800
Um and according to and also connected

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.070
Um and according to and also connected to attributes we have a second um kind

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080
to attributes we have a second um kind

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.870
to attributes we have a second um kind of type of attributes that are called

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880
of type of attributes that are called

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.110
of type of attributes that are called called variables. And the difference

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120
called variables. And the difference

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.790
called variables. And the difference here is that um attributes it's just

01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800
here is that um attributes it's just

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.270
here is that um attributes it's just basically available from the code. And

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280
basically available from the code. And

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.110
basically available from the code. And if you want uh user to be able to set a

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120
if you want uh user to be able to set a

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.950
if you want uh user to be able to set a value

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960
value

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.510
value uh for this attribute then you need to

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520
uh for this attribute then you need to

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.950
uh for this attribute then you need to create a variable because this is um

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960
create a variable because this is um

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.189
create a variable because this is um attribute that I can change from the UI.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199
attribute that I can change from the UI.

01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:35.510
attribute that I can change from the UI. Uh we access them exactly the same way

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520
Uh we access them exactly the same way

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.910
Uh we access them exactly the same way as attributes.

01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920
as attributes.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.229
as attributes. uh and how to define it

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239
uh and how to define it

01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:46.070
uh and how to define it on the same level as steps and other and

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080
on the same level as steps and other and

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.790
on the same level as steps and other and attributes. We have a section for

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800
attributes. We have a section for

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.990
attributes. We have a section for variable definitions and variables and

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000
variable definitions and variables and

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.950
variable definitions and variables and this is the name of my variable.

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960
this is the name of my variable.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.350
this is the name of my variable. So here uh you need to specify some

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360
So here uh you need to specify some

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.590
So here uh you need to specify some additional elements because it will be

01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600
additional elements because it will be

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.750
additional elements because it will be displayed in the UI. Then you need to

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760
displayed in the UI. Then you need to

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.510
displayed in the UI. Then you need to specify the type, default value and uh

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520
specify the type, default value and uh

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.030
specify the type, default value and uh form options for the UI. Okay. Uh so

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040
form options for the UI. Okay. Uh so

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.110
form options for the UI. Okay. Uh so this actually I cannot show you this

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120
this actually I cannot show you this

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.189
this actually I cannot show you this because alternative checkout it's

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199
because alternative checkout it's

01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:15.590
because alternative checkout it's already a separate se separate package

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600
already a separate se separate package

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.669
already a separate se separate package but we do have one uh workflow on this

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679
but we do have one uh workflow on this

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:23.350
but we do have one uh workflow on this list that has a variable and if it has

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360
list that has a variable and if it has

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.229
list that has a variable and if it has then you will see this cog icon to

01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239
then you will see this cog icon to

01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:28.630
then you will see this cog icon to configure. Okay. So those do not have

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640
configure. Okay. So those do not have

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.750
configure. Okay. So those do not have variables but this one has it's back

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760
variables but this one has it's back

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.229
variables but this one has it's back office quote with flow with approvals.

01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239
office quote with flow with approvals.

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.550
office quote with flow with approvals. And if I go to configuration you'll see

01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560
And if I go to configuration you'll see

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.950
And if I go to configuration you'll see that here I have very simple variable

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960
that here I have very simple variable

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.070
that here I have very simple variable it's only boolean accepts true false. So

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080
it's only boolean accepts true false. So

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.390
it's only boolean accepts true false. So you'll have this variable available in

01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400
you'll have this variable available in

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.590
you'll have this variable available in the checkout and based on this what I

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600
the checkout and based on this what I

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.669
the checkout and based on this what I select here. So if it's true you can do

01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679
select here. So if it's true you can do

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.189
select here. So if it's true you can do something if it's false you can do

01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199
something if it's false you can do

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:55.350
something if it's false you can do something else. So in case you need some

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360
something else. So in case you need some

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.149
something else. So in case you need some the configurable attribute go with a

01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159
the configurable attribute go with a

01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:03.189
the configurable attribute go with a variable. And this actually

01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:21.990
goes to goes to goes to

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.430
price overrite trigger

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440
price overrite trigger

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.229
price overrite trigger approval variables. Okay, so we have

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239
approval variables. Okay, so we have

01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:30.550
approval variables. Okay, so we have only one variable it's boolean by

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560
only one variable it's boolean by

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.750
only one variable it's boolean by default true and we just have a tool tip

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760
default true and we just have a tool tip

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.189
default true and we just have a tool tip there tool tip value it's taken from the

01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199
there tool tip value it's taken from the

01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:39.110
there tool tip value it's taken from the translation.

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120
translation.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.990
translation. Okay, so this is the definition of this

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000
Okay, so this is the definition of this

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.030
Okay, so this is the definition of this variable that we now have here and later

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040
variable that we now have here and later

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.270
variable that we now have here and later on you can fetch this variable exactly

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280
on you can fetch this variable exactly

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.270
on you can fetch this variable exactly the same way we fetch attributes. go

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280
the same way we fetch attributes. go

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.910
the same way we fetch attributes. go this way and based on its value do some

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920
this way and based on its value do some

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.630
this way and based on its value do some different things.

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640
different things.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.470
different things. And last element before we go to

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480
And last element before we go to

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.229
And last element before we go to transitions and transition definitions

01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239
transitions and transition definitions

01:18:58.239 --> 01:18:59.990
transitions and transition definitions which is actually the most interesting

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000
which is actually the most interesting

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.550
which is actually the most interesting part of our workflow

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560
part of our workflow

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.550
part of our workflow uh is entity entity restrictions. Uh so

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560
uh is entity entity restrictions. Uh so

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.510
uh is entity entity restrictions. Uh so here you can restrict um modification of

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520
here you can restrict um modification of

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.669
here you can restrict um modification of some attribute fields. As I already told

01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679
some attribute fields. As I already told

01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:14.550
some attribute fields. As I already told you previously this example that you can

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560
you previously this example that you can

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.790
you previously this example that you can have um like status field and you can

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800
have um like status field and you can

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.430
have um like status field and you can have 10 statuses but you want only two

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440
have 10 statuses but you want only two

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.189
have 10 statuses but you want only two of them to be available in some

01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199
of them to be available in some

01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:27.750
of them to be available in some particular step. Um, so this is how you

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760
particular step. Um, so this is how you

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.070
particular step. Um, so this is how you do it. And you have three modes here.

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080
do it. And you have three modes here.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.550
do it. And you have three modes here. Full, disallow, and allow. And by

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560
Full, disallow, and allow. And by

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.189
Full, disallow, and allow. And by default, it's full, which means that

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199
default, it's full, which means that

01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:42.310
default, it's full, which means that some will be will not be available at

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320
some will be will not be available at

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.750
some will be will not be available at all. If you specify disallow, then you

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760
all. If you specify disallow, then you

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.149
all. If you specify disallow, then you need to specify the disallowed values.

01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159
need to specify the disallowed values.

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:50.630
need to specify the disallowed values. If you specify allow, then you need to

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640
If you specify allow, then you need to

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.189
If you specify allow, then you need to specify allowed values.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199
specify allowed values.

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:57.669
specify allowed values. and example

01:19:57.679 --> 01:20:00.149
uh under my workflow name we have

01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159
uh under my workflow name we have

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:02.870
uh under my workflow name we have section for entity restriction and we

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880
section for entity restriction and we

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.430
section for entity restriction and we can have multiple restrictions

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440
can have multiple restrictions

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.750
can have multiple restrictions uh so here I'm specifying that the

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760
uh so here I'm specifying that the

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.350
uh so here I'm specifying that the status field of my opportunity

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360
status field of my opportunity

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.990
status field of my opportunity um I not allowing to change status to

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000
um I not allowing to change status to

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.590
um I not allowing to change status to one or lost okay so u imagine that here

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600
one or lost okay so u imagine that here

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.350
one or lost okay so u imagine that here when I'm transiting

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360
when I'm transiting

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.750
when I'm transiting and adding Twitter. Imagine that Twitter

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760
and adding Twitter. Imagine that Twitter

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.510
and adding Twitter. Imagine that Twitter is a drop list of 10 elements. So, it

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520
is a drop list of 10 elements. So, it

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.550
is a drop list of 10 elements. So, it will be only eight. Okay, I will not

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560
will be only eight. Okay, I will not

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.709
will be only eight. Okay, I will not have those two

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719
have those two

01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:37.430
have those two um elements on the list whenever I

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440
um elements on the list whenever I

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.870
um elements on the list whenever I transit. And that's basically

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880
transit. And that's basically

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.350
transit. And that's basically all or you can disable the whole field

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360
all or you can disable the whole field

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.350
all or you can disable the whole field um there. So in case you will not have

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360
um there. So in case you will not have

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.149
um there. So in case you will not have it in the popup in the form

01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159
it in the popup in the form

01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:56.550
it in the popup in the form even there and that's basically it.

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560
even there and that's basically it.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.070
even there and that's basically it. Okay. So let's switch to transitions. Uh

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080
Okay. So let's switch to transitions. Uh

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.669
Okay. So let's switch to transitions. Uh so transition is actually our

01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679
so transition is actually our

01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:03.830
so transition is actually our representation of changing a state. So

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840
representation of changing a state. So

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.310
representation of changing a state. So if we want to push our entity from one

01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320
if we want to push our entity from one

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.310
if we want to push our entity from one step to the other, we need to create

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320
step to the other, we need to create

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.430
step to the other, we need to create transition and it always leads to one

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440
transition and it always leads to one

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.630
transition and it always leads to one workflow step.

01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640
workflow step.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.149
workflow step. uh we can have multiple start

01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159
uh we can have multiple start

01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:18.470
uh we can have multiple start transitions. So as I told you the

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480
transitions. So as I told you the

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.870
transitions. So as I told you the checkout is started from the order by

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880
checkout is started from the order by

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.189
checkout is started from the order by clicking pre-order button or from the

01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199
clicking pre-order button or from the

01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:26.070
clicking pre-order button or from the quick order form or basically most of

01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080
quick order form or basically most of

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.510
quick order form or basically most of the cases from the shopping list. Uh but

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520
the cases from the shopping list. Uh but

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.630
the cases from the shopping list. Uh but it leads to one start step.

01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:32.640
it leads to one start step.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.430
it leads to one start step. Um when this transition is happening we

01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440
Um when this transition is happening we

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.590
Um when this transition is happening we can have a form with attribute fields

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600
can have a form with attribute fields

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.390
can have a form with attribute fields and this is exactly what we are seeing

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400
and this is exactly what we are seeing

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.030
and this is exactly what we are seeing here. So this form with attributes this

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040
here. So this form with attributes this

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.550
here. So this form with attributes this is defined inside transition.

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560
is defined inside transition.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.070
is defined inside transition. Uh you can also specify ACL restriction.

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080
Uh you can also specify ACL restriction.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.350
Uh you can also specify ACL restriction. So you remember ACL's we can uh restrict

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360
So you remember ACL's we can uh restrict

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.910
So you remember ACL's we can uh restrict our transition with some particular ACL

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920
our transition with some particular ACL

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.510
our transition with some particular ACL and then um

01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520
and then um

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.470
and then um restrict the user from being able to

01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480
restrict the user from being able to

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:06.709
restrict the user from being able to click the button uh if this user's role

01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719
click the button uh if this user's role

01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:10.709
click the button uh if this user's role doesn't have appropriate permissions.

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719
doesn't have appropriate permissions.

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:13.510
doesn't have appropriate permissions. uh and then also here we can have some

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520
uh and then also here we can have some

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.390
uh and then also here we can have some additional actions and conditions but

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400
additional actions and conditions but

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.030
additional actions and conditions but those parts are actually defined inside

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040
those parts are actually defined inside

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.950
those parts are actually defined inside transition definition that I will show

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960
transition definition that I will show

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.110
transition definition that I will show you in a moment. So first let's see

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120
you in a moment. So first let's see

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.830
you in a moment. So first let's see transitions.

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840
transitions.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.590
transitions. So here we have everything that I

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600
So here we have everything that I

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.149
So here we have everything that I actually was able to create via the UI.

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159
actually was able to create via the UI.

01:22:30.159 --> 01:22:33.430
actually was able to create via the UI. So the definition so my transition

01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440
So the definition so my transition

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.390
So the definition so my transition uh like this one and we can have a form

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400
uh like this one and we can have a form

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.470
uh like this one and we can have a form pop up and that's it. All the other

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480
pop up and that's it. All the other

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.189
pop up and that's it. All the other parts are in transition definitions and

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199
parts are in transition definitions and

01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:44.070
parts are in transition definitions and that's where the fun part is happening.

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080
that's where the fun part is happening.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.750
that's where the fun part is happening. So for my step you can define uh this

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760
So for my step you can define uh this

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.830
So for my step you can define uh this default start step. So whenever you

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840
default start step. So whenever you

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.870
default start step. So whenever you start um

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880
start um

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.950
start um the workflow and you want some

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960
the workflow and you want some

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.830
the workflow and you want some additional things to happen then

01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840
additional things to happen then

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.430
additional things to happen then application by default will execute this

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440
application by default will execute this

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.110
application by default will execute this transition.

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120
transition.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.950
transition. If you don't need anything to happen

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960
If you don't need anything to happen

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.550
If you don't need anything to happen when workflow is started, just omit this

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560
when workflow is started, just omit this

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.590
when workflow is started, just omit this uh transition. And then here we see

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600
uh transition. And then here we see

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.430
uh transition. And then here we see develop close one and close lost. And

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440
develop close one and close lost. And

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.669
develop close one and close lost. And this directly goes to let me

01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679
this directly goes to let me

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:22.790
this directly goes to let me to this. Okay. So we have step open and

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800
to this. Okay. So we have step open and

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.950
to this. Okay. So we have step open and available transitions from open step are

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960
available transitions from open step are

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.149
available transitions from open step are develop close one and close lost. And

01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159
develop close one and close lost. And

01:23:28.159 --> 01:23:31.750
develop close one and close lost. And this directly goes to this names. Then

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760
this directly goes to this names. Then

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.510
this directly goes to this names. Then uh for the develop step two is open. So

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520
uh for the develop step two is open. So

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.629
uh for the develop step two is open. So as I assumed this transition will just

01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639
as I assumed this transition will just

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.870
as I assumed this transition will just go from open to open and will do

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880
go from open to open and will do

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.950
go from open to open and will do something but will actually not change

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960
something but will actually not change

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.950
something but will actually not change the step.

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960
the step.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.750
the step. Uh then we have a second transition

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760
Uh then we have a second transition

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.990
Uh then we have a second transition which is which is close one. It's step

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000
which is which is close one. It's step

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.590
which is which is close one. It's step to one. So this is what I assumed. This

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600
to one. So this is what I assumed. This

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.990
to one. So this is what I assumed. This transition will lead me from open to

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000
transition will lead me from open to

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.310
transition will lead me from open to one. And this is step two.

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320
one. And this is step two.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.390
one. And this is step two. Then we have a setting is unavailable

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400
Then we have a setting is unavailable

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.669
Then we have a setting is unavailable hidden uh which will mean uh should we

01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679
hidden uh which will mean uh should we

01:24:05.679 --> 01:24:08.390
hidden uh which will mean uh should we hide the button if we are not able to

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400
hide the button if we are not able to

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.229
hide the button if we are not able to click it.

01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239
click it.

01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:12.310
click it. So because we can hide the button or we

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320
So because we can hide the button or we

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.669
So because we can hide the button or we can display it but it will be disabled.

01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679
can display it but it will be disabled.

01:24:15.679 --> 01:24:17.750
can display it but it will be disabled. Uh then we can set some additional

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760
Uh then we can set some additional

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.229
Uh then we can set some additional elements uh for this button like icon

01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239
elements uh for this button like icon

01:24:20.239 --> 01:24:21.990
elements uh for this button like icon class

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000
class

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.830
class and then the important part we need to

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840
and then the important part we need to

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.310
and then the important part we need to specify transition definition. It can be

01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320
specify transition definition. It can be

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.950
specify transition definition. It can be empty but it need to be specified and I

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960
empty but it need to be specified and I

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.709
empty but it need to be specified and I will show you in a moment what we can do

01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719
will show you in a moment what we can do

01:24:30.719 --> 01:24:34.149
will show you in a moment what we can do inside the definition. Uh for now uh

01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159
inside the definition. Uh for now uh

01:24:34.159 --> 01:24:35.990
inside the definition. Uh for now uh just please notice that we have this

01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000
just please notice that we have this

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.310
just please notice that we have this naming convention that whenever my

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320
naming convention that whenever my

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.790
naming convention that whenever my transition is named close one then

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800
transition is named close one then

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.709
transition is named close one then transition definition will be named

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719
transition definition will be named

01:24:42.719 --> 01:24:45.590
transition definition will be named closed one definition. We have this

01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600
closed one definition. We have this

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.590
closed one definition. We have this naming convention because it's really

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600
naming convention because it's really

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.750
naming convention because it's really much easier than to find something in

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760
much easier than to find something in

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:55.350
much easier than to find something in code um when it's named this way.

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360
code um when it's named this way.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.629
code um when it's named this way. And in my uh transition, we can also

01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639
And in my uh transition, we can also

01:24:58.639 --> 01:25:02.550
And in my uh transition, we can also specify the form for this popup under

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560
specify the form for this popup under

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.070
specify the form for this popup under the form options. So under the attribute

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080
the form options. So under the attribute

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.669
the form options. So under the attribute fields, we can specify what fields to

01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679
fields, we can specify what fields to

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:13.590
fields, we can specify what fields to display. Uh so you can have actually

01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600
display. Uh so you can have actually

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.750
display. Uh so you can have actually here we have like some custom elements.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760
here we have like some custom elements.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.390
here we have like some custom elements. So we will have two elements in our form

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400
So we will have two elements in our form

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.110
So we will have two elements in our form popup and close date uh only has

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120
popup and close date uh only has

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.750
popup and close date uh only has additional constraints. It cannot be

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760
additional constraints. It cannot be

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.790
additional constraints. It cannot be blank. Uh but it will be displayed based

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800
blank. Uh but it will be displayed based

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.830
blank. Uh but it will be displayed based on the type. So Oro will automatically

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840
on the type. So Oro will automatically

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.070
on the type. So Oro will automatically guess what

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080
guess what

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.189
guess what to display in this form. So here it's a

01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199
to display in this form. So here it's a

01:25:39.199 --> 01:25:41.590
to display in this form. So here it's a date. So it probably will be some date

01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600
date. So it probably will be some date

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.790
date. So it probably will be some date picker based on this variable type.

01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800
picker based on this variable type.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.149
picker based on this variable type. Okay. So this is close date. uh on our

01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159
Okay. So this is close date. uh on our

01:25:50.159 --> 01:25:51.669
Okay. So this is close date. uh on our entity.

01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679
entity.

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:54.790
entity. So it will take the type from entity. Uh

01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800
So it will take the type from entity. Uh

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.110
So it will take the type from entity. Uh if you want to render it, do not let Oro

01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120
if you want to render it, do not let Oro

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.590
if you want to render it, do not let Oro automatically guess uh how to render

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600
automatically guess uh how to render

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.750
automatically guess uh how to render this attribute. So if it should be input

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760
this attribute. So if it should be input

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.990
this attribute. So if it should be input text input or daytime picker or

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000
text input or daytime picker or

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.709
text input or daytime picker or whatever, you can basically specify

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719
whatever, you can basically specify

01:26:08.719 --> 01:26:13.030
whatever, you can basically specify manually which form type to use.

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040
manually which form type to use.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.709
manually which form type to use. And if you don't want to edit to modify

01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719
And if you don't want to edit to modify

01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:18.709
And if you don't want to edit to modify anything, you can always go with close

01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719
anything, you can always go with close

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:21.030
anything, you can always go with close revenue and tilda. Then it will just

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040
revenue and tilda. Then it will just

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.990
revenue and tilda. Then it will just automatically guess everything.

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000
automatically guess everything.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.990
automatically guess everything. And to be able to to have those

01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000
And to be able to to have those

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.550
And to be able to to have those attribute fields rendered in a form, do

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560
attribute fields rendered in a form, do

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.550
attribute fields rendered in a form, do not forget that you need to put this

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560
not forget that you need to put this

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.590
not forget that you need to put this as an attribute.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.350
Um

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360
Um

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.030
Um yep this is added as an attribute and it

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040
yep this is added as an attribute and it

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.390
yep this is added as an attribute and it leads to some field on my entity and now

01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400
leads to some field on my entity and now

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.390
leads to some field on my entity and now I can modify this attribute

01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400
I can modify this attribute

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.110
I can modify this attribute here. Okay. So remember that if you want

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120
here. Okay. So remember that if you want

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.870
here. Okay. So remember that if you want to work with some data modify some data

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880
to work with some data modify some data

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.390
to work with some data modify some data with this form type they need to be uh

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400
with this form type they need to be uh

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.550
with this form type they need to be uh added to attributes section as well.

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560
added to attributes section as well.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.030
added to attributes section as well. Uh and if you want to do something uh

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040
Uh and if you want to do something uh

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.669
Uh and if you want to do something uh when the form is initialized, normally

01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679
when the form is initialized, normally

01:27:09.679 --> 01:27:13.750
when the form is initialized, normally we don't, but there are some

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760
we don't, but there are some

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.430
we don't, but there are some situations that you want to do

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440
situations that you want to do

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.430
situations that you want to do something. There is a specific section

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440
something. There is a specific section

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.629
something. There is a specific section called form in it. And here uh is where

01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639
called form in it. And here uh is where

01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:25.910
called form in it. And here uh is where you actually the first time um see

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920
you actually the first time um see

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.229
you actually the first time um see those actions.

01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239
those actions.

01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:31.669
those actions. Uh so the form in it as well as our

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679
Uh so the form in it as well as our

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.590
Uh so the form in it as well as our transition definitions and all those

01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600
transition definitions and all those

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.550
transition definitions and all those elements uh are built from actions. So

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560
elements uh are built from actions. So

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.270
elements uh are built from actions. So if you want to do something you need to

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280
if you want to do something you need to

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.550
if you want to do something you need to represent it with this short

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560
represent it with this short

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.110
represent it with this short um

01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120
um

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:49.110
um action behind this there is a PHP class.

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120
action behind this there is a PHP class.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.270
action behind this there is a PHP class. Okay. So this element this element all

01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280
Okay. So this element this element all

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.430
Okay. So this element this element all this is an action. we reaching the

01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440
this is an action. we reaching the

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.510
this is an action. we reaching the actions by the aliases and this is the

01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520
actions by the aliases and this is the

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.229
actions by the aliases and this is the alias of my action. Uh and those are in

01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239
alias of my action. Uh and those are in

01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:04.149
alias of my action. Uh and those are in a background those are PHP classes that

01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159
a background those are PHP classes that

01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:07.350
a background those are PHP classes that are executing uh appropriate methods. So

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360
are executing uh appropriate methods. So

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.070
are executing uh appropriate methods. So those methods can um

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080
those methods can um

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.229
those methods can um you can pass

01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239
you can pass

01:28:14.239 --> 01:28:16.149
you can pass some variables to those methods and

01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159
some variables to those methods and

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:19.669
some variables to those methods and those methods can return something. So

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679
those methods can return something. So

01:28:19.679 --> 01:28:23.189
those methods can return something. So for example this action uh it's request

01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199
for example this action uh it's request

01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:25.030
for example this action uh it's request anom entity I will show you in a moment

01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040
anom entity I will show you in a moment

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.950
anom entity I will show you in a moment that the PHP representation for it. So

01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960
that the PHP representation for it. So

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.669
that the PHP representation for it. So when you call it this way uh you're

01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679
when you call it this way uh you're

01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:34.629
when you call it this way uh you're actually executing some method. So if

01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639
actually executing some method. So if

01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:37.990
actually executing some method. So if this method uh requires some fields you

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000
this method uh requires some fields you

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.110
this method uh requires some fields you will need to pass them and then if this

01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120
will need to pass them and then if this

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.070
will need to pass them and then if this method returns something it will return

01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080
method returns something it will return

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.830
method returns something it will return it. uh and he by the attribute you

01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840
it. uh and he by the attribute you

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.270
it. uh and he by the attribute you specify where to return uh the value. So

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280
specify where to return uh the value. So

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.310
specify where to return uh the value. So the return value of this method will be

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320
the return value of this method will be

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.350
the return value of this method will be saved to my opportunity status. And here

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360
saved to my opportunity status. And here

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.950
saved to my opportunity status. And here we are basically fetching um some enom

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960
we are basically fetching um some enom

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.510
we are basically fetching um some enom because opportunity status is a separate

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520
because opportunity status is a separate

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.830
because opportunity status is a separate entity. Uh it's an enom. Uh so we need

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840
entity. Uh it's an enom. Uh so we need

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:11.750
entity. Uh it's an enom. Uh so we need to fetch it by some identifier. This is

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760
to fetch it by some identifier. This is

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.310
to fetch it by some identifier. This is an code and this is identifier. So at

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320
an code and this is identifier. So at

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.510
an code and this is identifier. So at the end we have our enum and we are

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520
the end we have our enum and we are

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.110
the end we have our enum and we are saving it to the status field on our

01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120
saving it to the status field on our

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.470
saving it to the status field on our entity and this is what it did and this

01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480
entity and this is what it did and this

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.110
entity and this is what it did and this is actually the core of our transition

01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120
is actually the core of our transition

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.030
is actually the core of our transition definitions.

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040
definitions.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.870
definitions. Um so let me actually go further.

01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880
Um so let me actually go further.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.830
Um so let me actually go further. So regarding the transitions that's all

01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840
So regarding the transitions that's all

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.910
So regarding the transitions that's all you can do.

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920
you can do.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.310
you can do. There's really not much. So you just

01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320
There's really not much. So you just

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.510
There's really not much. So you just define step two

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520
define step two

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.149
define step two uh transition definition and if you want

01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159
uh transition definition and if you want

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:53.189
uh transition definition and if you want some form in a popup you define it this

01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199
some form in a popup you define it this

01:29:53.199 --> 01:29:55.910
some form in a popup you define it this way. If there needs to something needs

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920
way. If there needs to something needs

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.990
way. If there needs to something needs to happen when the form is initialized

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000
to happen when the form is initialized

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.709
to happen when the form is initialized then you have a section here and you can

01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719
then you have a section here and you can

01:30:00.719 --> 01:30:04.709
then you have a section here and you can put any action uh in here. What about

01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719
put any action uh in here. What about

01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:07.189
put any action uh in here. What about those actions? They are really really

01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199
those actions? They are really really

01:30:07.199 --> 01:30:10.229
those actions? They are really really connected to our transition definitions.

01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239
connected to our transition definitions.

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:12.229
connected to our transition definitions. So let me switch to transition

01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239
So let me switch to transition

01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:13.830
So let me switch to transition definition.

01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840
definition.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.709
definition. Uh here you have a place where you can

01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719
Uh here you have a place where you can

01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:21.270
Uh here you have a place where you can do anything. You can put conditions here

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280
do anything. You can put conditions here

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.750
do anything. You can put conditions here and based on those conditions you can to

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760
and based on those conditions you can to

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.910
and based on those conditions you can to do different actions. Okay. And we have

01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920
do different actions. Okay. And we have

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.510
do different actions. Okay. And we have four

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520
four

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.990
four sections inside transition definition.

01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000
sections inside transition definition.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.310
sections inside transition definition. Pre-actions, preconditions, actions and

01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320
Pre-actions, preconditions, actions and

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.830
Pre-actions, preconditions, actions and conditions. So the first two are

01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840
conditions. So the first two are

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.790
conditions. So the first two are executed before the button is rendered.

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800
executed before the button is rendered.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.910
executed before the button is rendered. So we are checking preconditions and if

01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920
So we are checking preconditions and if

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.470
So we are checking preconditions and if those preconditions are met then we are

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480
those preconditions are met then we are

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.790
those preconditions are met then we are displaying the button I mean the button

01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800
displaying the button I mean the button

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.910
displaying the button I mean the button is active because you can also decide to

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920
is active because you can also decide to

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.110
is active because you can also decide to display it but uh make it uh disabled

01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120
display it but uh make it uh disabled

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.229
display it but uh make it uh disabled right so if the preconditions are met

01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239
right so if the preconditions are met

01:30:58.239 --> 01:31:01.669
right so if the preconditions are met then the button is rendered and you're

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679
then the button is rendered and you're

01:31:01.679 --> 01:31:03.590
then the button is rendered and you're able to click it. If in the

01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600
able to click it. If in the

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.350
able to click it. If in the preconditions you want to check

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360
preconditions you want to check

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.350
preconditions you want to check something but you don't have this data

01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360
something but you don't have this data

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.590
something but you don't have this data you need to fetch it. Then there is the

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600
you need to fetch it. Then there is the

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.070
you need to fetch it. Then there is the section for pre-actions. So inside

01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080
section for pre-actions. So inside

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.470
section for pre-actions. So inside pre-actions you can do anything for

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480
pre-actions you can do anything for

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.110
pre-actions you can do anything for example fetch some values that you will

01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120
example fetch some values that you will

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.470
example fetch some values that you will later check in preconditions

01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480
later check in preconditions

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.270
later check in preconditions and now the button is rendered. Then uh

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280
and now the button is rendered. Then uh

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.030
and now the button is rendered. Then uh the second part is happening when you

01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040
the second part is happening when you

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.790
the second part is happening when you click the button. Whenever you click the

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800
click the button. Whenever you click the

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.229
click the button. Whenever you click the button, we are checking the conditions

01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239
button, we are checking the conditions

01:31:30.239 --> 01:31:32.950
button, we are checking the conditions and if the conditions are met, then we

01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960
and if the conditions are met, then we

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.430
and if the conditions are met, then we are performing actions.

01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440
are performing actions.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.030
are performing actions. So if you don't want to do anything

01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040
So if you don't want to do anything

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.510
So if you don't want to do anything additional, uh you still need to create

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520
additional, uh you still need to create

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.669
additional, uh you still need to create transition definition but it can be

01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679
transition definition but it can be

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:44.790
transition definition but it can be empty and also those transition

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800
empty and also those transition

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.030
empty and also those transition definitions can be reused. We are

01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040
definitions can be reused. We are

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.310
definitions can be reused. We are actually not using this uh because as I

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320
actually not using this uh because as I

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.350
actually not using this uh because as I told you we'll always creating um

01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360
told you we'll always creating um

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.750
told you we'll always creating um transition definition

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760
transition definition

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.390
transition definition with this definition postfix

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400
with this definition postfix

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.629
with this definition postfix but uh in theory and in practice you can

01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639
but uh in theory and in practice you can

01:32:02.639 --> 01:32:05.110
but uh in theory and in practice you can use the same transition definition in

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120
use the same transition definition in

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.189
use the same transition definition in multiple transitions.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199
multiple transitions.

01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:09.830
multiple transitions. So what we have in this transition

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840
So what we have in this transition

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.790
So what we have in this transition definition

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800
definition

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.149
definition uh let's

01:32:16.159 --> 01:32:18.149
yeah under opportunity flow under

01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159
yeah under opportunity flow under

01:32:18.159 --> 01:32:21.030
yeah under opportunity flow under transition definition section let's

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040
transition definition section let's

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.590
transition definition section let's check this close one definition okay uh

01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600
check this close one definition okay uh

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.189
check this close one definition okay uh this is my close one transition and it

01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199
this is my close one transition and it

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:32.790
this is my close one transition and it has some additional actions happening

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800
has some additional actions happening

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.830
has some additional actions happening so whenever we are in open step and we

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840
so whenever we are in open step and we

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.990
so whenever we are in open step and we click the close one button button. This

01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000
click the close one button button. This

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.310
click the close one button button. This transition will be executed and it will

01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320
transition will be executed and it will

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.390
transition will be executed and it will execute

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400
execute

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.189
execute also the transition definition and we

01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199
also the transition definition and we

01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:48.790
also the transition definition and we will be redirected to the one step. So

01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800
will be redirected to the one step. So

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.270
will be redirected to the one step. So what will happen inside this transition?

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280
what will happen inside this transition?

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.750
what will happen inside this transition? It's defined here

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760
It's defined here

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.550
It's defined here and here is my close one definition. We

01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560
and here is my close one definition. We

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.310
and here is my close one definition. We don't have any prections or any

01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320
don't have any prections or any

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.470
don't have any prections or any preconditions. So this button will be

01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480
preconditions. So this button will be

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.870
preconditions. So this button will be displayed always. But whenever I click

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880
displayed always. But whenever I click

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.110
displayed always. But whenever I click it, it will check the conditions. Uh as

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120
it, it will check the conditions. Uh as

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.910
it, it will check the conditions. Uh as you can see behind all this if it's

01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920
you can see behind all this if it's

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.990
you can see behind all this if it's condition and if it's action behind all

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000
condition and if it's action behind all

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.629
condition and if it's action behind all this there is a PHP class and this is an

01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639
this there is a PHP class and this is an

01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:17.750
this there is a PHP class and this is an alias of this class and as you can see

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760
alias of this class and as you can see

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.390
alias of this class and as you can see we are naming those aliases the way that

01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400
we are naming those aliases the way that

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:23.669
we are naming those aliases the way that you can just basically by the name

01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679
you can just basically by the name

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:27.430
you can just basically by the name um tell what's going on. So I don't need

01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440
um tell what's going on. So I don't need

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.430
um tell what's going on. So I don't need to check the implementation to tell you

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440
to check the implementation to tell you

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.430
to check the implementation to tell you that this condition is checking if some

01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440
that this condition is checking if some

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.189
that this condition is checking if some value is empty or not. Uh so here we

01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199
value is empty or not. Uh so here we

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:37.990
value is empty or not. Uh so here we need to pass uh one parameter and we are

01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000
need to pass uh one parameter and we are

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.750
need to pass uh one parameter and we are checking the close date. If it's empty

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760
checking the close date. If it's empty

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.629
checking the close date. If it's empty if it's empty then we are doing actions.

01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639
if it's empty then we are doing actions.

01:33:44.639 --> 01:33:48.709
if it's empty then we are doing actions. If not we are displaying this message

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719
If not we are displaying this message

01:33:48.719 --> 01:33:51.830
If not we are displaying this message and we not proceeding to actions. Okay.

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840
and we not proceeding to actions. Okay.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.750
and we not proceeding to actions. Okay. So first we check the conditions. If

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760
So first we check the conditions. If

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.910
So first we check the conditions. If they are met we go to actions and in

01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920
they are met we go to actions and in

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.950
they are met we go to actions and in those actions you can do anything.

01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960
those actions you can do anything.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.270
those actions you can do anything. Um, you can send email, you can display

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280
Um, you can send email, you can display

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.510
Um, you can send email, you can display flash message, you can clone entity, you

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520
flash message, you can clone entity, you

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.149
flash message, you can clone entity, you can do pretty much anything. And if the

01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159
can do pretty much anything. And if the

01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:10.390
can do pretty much anything. And if the actions that are defined in Oro are not

01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400
actions that are defined in Oro are not

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.990
actions that are defined in Oro are not enough, you are also welcome to

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000
enough, you are also welcome to

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.470
enough, you are also welcome to implement your own actions. And how I

01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480
implement your own actions. And how I

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.070
implement your own actions. And how I will show you in a moment because I have

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080
will show you in a moment because I have

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.950
will show you in a moment because I have it on a separate slide.

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960
it on a separate slide.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.709
it on a separate slide. Uh, so for now what we are doing here

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719
Uh, so for now what we are doing here

01:34:22.719 --> 01:34:25.510
Uh, so for now what we are doing here just by the names of the actions. I'm

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520
just by the names of the actions. I'm

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.550
just by the names of the actions. I'm not going to PHP code yet. Here we are

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560
not going to PHP code yet. Here we are

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.110
not going to PHP code yet. Here we are fetching some enom entity and this is

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120
fetching some enom entity and this is

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.830
fetching some enom entity and this is actually opportunity status with one

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840
actually opportunity status with one

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.390
actually opportunity status with one identifier and this method returns the

01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400
identifier and this method returns the

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.350
identifier and this method returns the enum and we are saving this enum to

01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360
enum and we are saving this enum to

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.390
enum and we are saving this enum to opportunity status.

01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400
opportunity status.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:47.590
opportunity status. Then we are finding some not anom but

01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600
Then we are finding some not anom but

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.070
Then we are finding some not anom but some other entity. So we need to specify

01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080
some other entity. So we need to specify

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.510
some other entity. So we need to specify which entity and by which identifier.

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520
which entity and by which identifier.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.149
which entity and by which identifier. And again this find entity method

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159
And again this find entity method

01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:59.189
And again this find entity method returns this entity and we are saving it

01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199
returns this entity and we are saving it

01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:03.030
returns this entity and we are saving it to the close reason

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040
to the close reason

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.350
to the close reason uh variable. This is also on top of uh

01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360
uh variable. This is also on top of uh

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.070
uh variable. This is also on top of uh opportunity.

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080
opportunity.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.510
opportunity. Uh then we are assigning a value. So we

01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520
Uh then we are assigning a value. So we

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.070
Uh then we are assigning a value. So we are assigning one to this particular

01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080
are assigning one to this particular

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.590
are assigning one to this particular field.

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600
field.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.550
field. And we have also very nice action called

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560
And we have also very nice action called

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.390
And we have also very nice action called call service method which allows you to

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400
call service method which allows you to

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.950
call service method which allows you to call any method from any service. You

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960
call any method from any service. You

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.550
call any method from any service. You just need to specify the service name,

01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560
just need to specify the service name,

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.270
just need to specify the service name, the method name. If the method uh

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280
the method name. If the method uh

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.750
the method name. If the method uh requires some attributes, you specify it

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760
requires some attributes, you specify it

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.709
requires some attributes, you specify it in the method parameters section. And if

01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719
in the method parameters section. And if

01:35:34.719 --> 01:35:38.310
in the method parameters section. And if this uh method returns some value, here

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320
this uh method returns some value, here

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.390
this uh method returns some value, here you specify where this value should be

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400
you specify where this value should be

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.990
you specify where this value should be saved to. So with this four actions, we

01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000
saved to. So with this four actions, we

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.629
saved to. So with this four actions, we actually change the status of our

01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639
actually change the status of our

01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:53.030
actually change the status of our opportunity to one. Um

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.590
then we fetched opportunity close

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600
then we fetched opportunity close

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:59.030
then we fetched opportunity close reason. We changed it to one and then we

01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040
reason. We changed it to one and then we

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.950
reason. We changed it to one and then we changed the probability of our

01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960
changed the probability of our

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.950
changed the probability of our opportunity to some value based on the

01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960
opportunity to some value based on the

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.110
opportunity to some value based on the status.

01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:07.120
status.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.709
status. So we actually modified our opportunity

01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719
So we actually modified our opportunity

01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:17.430
So we actually modified our opportunity with those four little actions.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.669
Um,

01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679
Um,

01:36:19.679 --> 01:36:22.790
Um, okay. So, let's see those actions. As

01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800
okay. So, let's see those actions. As

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.790
okay. So, let's see those actions. As you already noticed, this is a small

01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800
you already noticed, this is a small

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.350
you already noticed, this is a small block of functionality that can have

01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360
block of functionality that can have

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.590
block of functionality that can have parameters and we also can have

01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600
parameters and we also can have

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.550
parameters and we also can have conditions there and all those actions

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560
conditions there and all those actions

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.990
conditions there and all those actions are PHP classes that are added in the DI

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000
are PHP classes that are added in the DI

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.950
are PHP classes that are added in the DI container with this oro action tag and

01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960
container with this oro action tag and

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.229
container with this oro action tag and they extend abstract action. So, let's

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239
they extend abstract action. So, let's

01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:46.229
they extend abstract action. So, let's see one of those.

01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:51.109
Let's say assign value.

01:36:51.119 --> 01:36:56.390
Okay.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.910
Assign value.

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.430
Okay. Maybe here.

01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440
Okay. Maybe here.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.629
Okay. Maybe here. I actually wanted to open it in

01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639
I actually wanted to open it in

01:37:10.639 --> 01:37:15.510
I actually wanted to open it in workflows, but

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.390
Okay. So with my aura plugin I just

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400
Okay. So with my aura plugin I just

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.750
Okay. So with my aura plugin I just controlcll cllicked it and it lead me to

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760
controlcll cllicked it and it lead me to

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.910
controlcll cllicked it and it lead me to implementation of this particular

01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920
implementation of this particular

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.109
implementation of this particular action. So it extends abstract action

01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119
action. So it extends abstract action

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:30.310
action. So it extends abstract action and uh the method that will be executed

01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320
and uh the method that will be executed

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.030
and uh the method that will be executed when you specify this

01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040
when you specify this

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.830
when you specify this it's going to be execute action and here

01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840
it's going to be execute action and here

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.550
it's going to be execute action and here you put all the implementation. So we

01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560
you put all the implementation. So we

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.870
you put all the implementation. So we are setting some value because this is

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880
are setting some value because this is

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.229
are setting some value because this is assign value action and then we need to

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239
assign value action and then we need to

01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:47.590
assign value action and then we need to add it to a DI container uh tag it with

01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600
add it to a DI container uh tag it with

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.910
add it to a DI container uh tag it with or action action and give it an alias

01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920
or action action and give it an alias

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.629
or action action and give it an alias and this alias is used here

01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639
and this alias is used here

01:37:54.639 --> 01:37:56.790
and this alias is used here and that's it.

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800
and that's it.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.870
and that's it. By the alias we using this particular

01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880
By the alias we using this particular

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.910
By the alias we using this particular class and executing this method. If this

01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920
class and executing this method. If this

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.189
class and executing this method. If this method returns a value in this case it

01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199
method returns a value in this case it

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:09.590
method returns a value in this case it doesn't but if it returns a value there

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600
doesn't but if it returns a value there

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.390
doesn't but if it returns a value there will be here this uh attribute part

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400
will be here this uh attribute part

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.590
will be here this uh attribute part and that's basically it.

01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600
and that's basically it.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.350
and that's basically it. So if you want to create some custom

01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360
So if you want to create some custom

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.350
So if you want to create some custom action and I can show you that we have a

01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360
action and I can show you that we have a

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.629
action and I can show you that we have a lot of actions already available for

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639
lot of actions already available for

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:28.229
lot of actions already available for you.

01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239
you.

01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:31.510
you. Uh okay. Call method. Assign value. Copy

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520
Uh okay. Call method. Assign value. Copy

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.350
Uh okay. Call method. Assign value. Copy values. Uh date methods. Create entity.

01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360
values. Uh date methods. Create entity.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.310
values. Uh date methods. Create entity. Redirect method. Translate flash

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320
Redirect method. Translate flash

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.109
Redirect method. Translate flash message. Seriously, a lot of

01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119
message. Seriously, a lot of

01:38:43.119 --> 01:38:46.070
message. Seriously, a lot of um like common actions. And then we also

01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080
um like common actions. And then we also

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.550
um like common actions. And then we also have some

01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560
have some

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.830
have some custom like for the payment. We have

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840
custom like for the payment. We have

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:55.430
custom like for the payment. We have also actions here. So in case you need a

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440
also actions here. So in case you need a

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.189
also actions here. So in case you need a custom action, you need to create PHP

01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199
custom action, you need to create PHP

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:03.510
custom action, you need to create PHP class that extends abstract action

01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520
class that extends abstract action

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.350
class that extends abstract action and uh implement the execute action add

01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360
and uh implement the execute action add

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.149
and uh implement the execute action add it in the DI container tag it with this

01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159
it in the DI container tag it with this

01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:12.550
it in the DI container tag it with this tag and provide an alias because with

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560
tag and provide an alias because with

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.590
tag and provide an alias because with this al alias later you'll be using it

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600
this al alias later you'll be using it

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.430
this al alias later you'll be using it from here and similar things are our uh

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440
from here and similar things are our uh

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.109
from here and similar things are our uh conditions. So you'll see for example we

01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119
conditions. So you'll see for example we

01:39:25.119 --> 01:39:27.750
conditions. So you'll see for example we have those standard conditions like and

01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760
have those standard conditions like and

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.709
have those standard conditions like and or equal.

01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719
or equal.

01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:35.189
or equal. Okay. So under this there is also um PHP

01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199
Okay. So under this there is also um PHP

01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:37.189
Okay. So under this there is also um PHP class

01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199
class

01:39:37.199 --> 01:39:43.990
class that it's just doing

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.430
the is condition allowed method. So here

01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440
the is condition allowed method. So here

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.229
the is condition allowed method. So here is the implementation

01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239
is the implementation

01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:53.430
is the implementation um of the check that this particular

01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440
um of the check that this particular

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.870
um of the check that this particular condition should do and similar uh to

01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880
condition should do and similar uh to

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.590
condition should do and similar uh to the actions you need to add it to the

01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600
the actions you need to add it to the

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.510
the actions you need to add it to the container just the tag now it's

01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520
container just the tag now it's

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.830
container just the tag now it's different it's our action condition tag

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840
different it's our action condition tag

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.870
different it's our action condition tag and also here you can specify the alias

01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880
and also here you can specify the alias

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.189
and also here you can specify the alias so with this alias later we will use

01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199
so with this alias later we will use

01:40:09.199 --> 01:40:12.629
so with this alias later we will use this condition in our y files so this

01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639
this condition in our y files so this

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:15.430
this condition in our y files so this goes to it if you have a pipe like this

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440
goes to it if you have a pipe like this

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.350
goes to it if you have a pipe like this one it means is that you have two

01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360
one it means is that you have two

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:25.350
one it means is that you have two aliases. So you can refer to it by at

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.669
equal or at the shortened version

01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679
equal or at the shortened version

01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:30.070
equal or at the shortened version however to read this.

01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080
however to read this.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.070
however to read this. Um

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080
Um

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.270
Um and if you want to create your own

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280
and if you want to create your own

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.149
and if you want to create your own because the list of our conditions is

01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159
because the list of our conditions is

01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:41.030
because the list of our conditions is not enough although it's really really

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040
not enough although it's really really

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.229
not enough although it's really really big extendable and or not empty has

01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239
big extendable and or not empty has

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:47.270
big extendable and or not empty has property has value less and so on and so

01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280
property has value less and so on and so

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.350
property has value less and so on and so on. You can create a custom one. Just

01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360
on. You can create a custom one. Just

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.590
on. You can create a custom one. Just create this class.

01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600
create this class.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.990
create this class. Tag it as or action condition. Give it

01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000
Tag it as or action condition. Give it

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.390
Tag it as or action condition. Give it some alias and um

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400
some alias and um

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.149
some alias and um conditions class needs to

01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159
conditions class needs to

01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:03.669
conditions class needs to extend

01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679
extend

01:41:03.679 --> 01:41:06.470
extend abstract condition from our oral

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480
abstract condition from our oral

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:09.270
abstract condition from our oral component.

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280
component.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.070
component. Um and that's basically all regarding

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080
Um and that's basically all regarding

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.270
Um and that's basically all regarding the actions uh transitions and what you

01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280
the actions uh transitions and what you

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.830
the actions uh transitions and what you can do here. So taking this into account

01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840
can do here. So taking this into account

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.310
can do here. So taking this into account in this actions which will happen after

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320
in this actions which will happen after

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.790
in this actions which will happen after you click the button you can do anything

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800
you click the button you can do anything

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.070
you click the button you can do anything you can reach all the uh opportunity

01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080
you can reach all the uh opportunity

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.870
you can reach all the uh opportunity uh fields. So you can modify for example

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880
uh fields. So you can modify for example

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.590
uh fields. So you can modify for example address on top of the customer or you

01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600
address on top of the customer or you

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.590
address on top of the customer or you can do some additional data like create

01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600
can do some additional data like create

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.470
can do some additional data like create a case when something happens or send

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480
a case when something happens or send

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.030
a case when something happens or send email or whatever.

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040
email or whatever.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.189
email or whatever. Yep.

01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199
Yep.

01:41:41.199 --> 01:41:45.189
Yep. Um have a question about conditions. So

01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199
Um have a question about conditions. So

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:48.310
Um have a question about conditions. So these conditions are happening on back

01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320
these conditions are happening on back

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.870
these conditions are happening on back end or front end or which level it

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880
end or front end or which level it

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.950
end or front end or which level it it's all happening in the background

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960
it's all happening in the background

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.669
it's all happening in the background whenever you uh whenever the transition

01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679
whenever you uh whenever the transition

01:41:57.679 --> 01:42:00.870
whenever you uh whenever the transition is happening.

01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880
is happening.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.189
is happening. So in the storefront in the UI you only

01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199
So in the storefront in the UI you only

01:42:03.199 --> 01:42:04.470
So in the storefront in the UI you only have button.

01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480
have button.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.189
have button. Whenever I click this button in the

01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199
Whenever I click this button in the

01:42:07.199 --> 01:42:09.350
Whenever I click this button in the background in the application we will

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360
background in the application we will

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.510
background in the application we will check conditions and if those conditions

01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520
check conditions and if those conditions

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.590
check conditions and if those conditions are met we will execute all those

01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600
are met we will execute all those

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.149
are met we will execute all those actions but you will not see it because

01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159
actions but you will not see it because

01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:18.149
actions but you will not see it because it will happen in the background when I

01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159
it will happen in the background when I

01:42:18.159 --> 01:42:19.910
it will happen in the background when I click this button something is happening

01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920
click this button something is happening

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.030
click this button something is happening in the background and I'm redirected to

01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040
in the background and I'm redirected to

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.629
in the background and I'm redirected to the next step.

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639
the next step.

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:26.390
the next step. So all this is happening in the

01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400
So all this is happening in the

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.790
So all this is happening in the background.

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800
background.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.990
background. um that I cannot spell a message. I just

01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000
um that I cannot spell a message. I just

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.990
um that I cannot spell a message. I just the only I can do is just to forward to

01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000
the only I can do is just to forward to

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.229
the only I can do is just to forward to error step or

01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239
error step or

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:39.990
error step or you can display a message because we

01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000
you can display a message because we

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.870
you can display a message because we have an action to display a message and

01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880
have an action to display a message and

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.470
have an action to display a message and this is um

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.950
it's called

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.109
it's called

01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119
it's called

01:42:55.119 --> 01:43:00.790
it's called Um,

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:06.470
flash message.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.109
Maybe this will be easier to understand.

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119
Maybe this will be easier to understand.

01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:11.030
Maybe this will be easier to understand. There is an action to display a flash

01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040
There is an action to display a flash

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.830
There is an action to display a flash message. This action, it's a PHP code in

01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840
message. This action, it's a PHP code in

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.350
message. This action, it's a PHP code in the background. It's just adding a

01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360
the background. It's just adding a

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.590
the background. It's just adding a message to Symfony Flashback. And by

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600
message to Symfony Flashback. And by

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.830
message to Symfony Flashback. And by default, whenever the page is refreshed,

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840
default, whenever the page is refreshed,

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.430
default, whenever the page is refreshed, uh, the new messages in Symphony

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440
uh, the new messages in Symphony

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.990
uh, the new messages in Symphony Flashback are displayed to the user. So

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000
Flashback are displayed to the user. So

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.830
Flashback are displayed to the user. So if you want to display this nice popup

01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840
if you want to display this nice popup

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.470
if you want to display this nice popup that something happened successfully or

01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480
that something happened successfully or

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.189
that something happened successfully or some error then uh this action is

01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199
some error then uh this action is

01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:33.510
some error then uh this action is available for you

01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520
available for you

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:36.070
available for you to pass the message. If this message is

01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080
to pass the message. If this message is

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.310
to pass the message. If this message is not flat but consists of some parameters

01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320
not flat but consists of some parameters

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.229
not flat but consists of some parameters like here we have the amount parameter

01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239
like here we have the amount parameter

01:43:40.239 --> 01:43:43.109
like here we have the amount parameter in this particular example then you can

01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119
in this particular example then you can

01:43:43.119 --> 01:43:47.030
in this particular example then you can also pass this amount parameter value

01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040
also pass this amount parameter value

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.189
also pass this amount parameter value and type success means just that this

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199
and type success means just that this

01:43:49.199 --> 01:43:51.350
and type success means just that this flash message will be a success. So it

01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360
flash message will be a success. So it

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.189
flash message will be a success. So it will be green. um errors are red and

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199
will be green. um errors are red and

01:43:55.199 --> 01:43:59.669
will be green. um errors are red and others I influence blue or something.

01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679
others I influence blue or something.

01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:03.270
others I influence blue or something. Okay. And uh other question um so when

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280
Okay. And uh other question um so when

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.070
Okay. And uh other question um so when we send this request to make transition

01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080
we send this request to make transition

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.790
we send this request to make transition and we see that it doesn't that um

01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800
and we see that it doesn't that um

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.669
and we see that it doesn't that um we cannot do the transition. How can we

01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679
we cannot do the transition. How can we

01:44:15.679 --> 01:44:18.390
we cannot do the transition. How can we notify custom? What what what happens

01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400
notify custom? What what what happens

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:23.030
notify custom? What what what happens here? So by default uh you have only

01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040
here? So by default uh you have only

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.189
here? So by default uh you have only displayed one error that this transition

01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199
displayed one error that this transition

01:44:25.199 --> 01:44:28.229
displayed one error that this transition is not available and that's it what you

01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239
is not available and that's it what you

01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:31.270
is not available and that's it what you have in the UI right so all the bugs

01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280
have in the UI right so all the bugs

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.990
have in the UI right so all the bugs will be in logs

01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000
will be in logs

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:34.310
will be in logs um

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320
um

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.550
um so if there is a bug it will be in log

01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560
so if there is a bug it will be in log

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.229
so if there is a bug it will be in log and uh if it's not

01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239
and uh if it's not

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:42.070
and uh if it's not how can I throw this uh throw this error

01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080
how can I throw this uh throw this error

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.750
how can I throw this uh throw this error message or how it happens I I just throw

01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760
message or how it happens I I just throw

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.629
message or how it happens I I just throw exception on the candle

01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639
exception on the candle

01:44:48.639 --> 01:44:52.390
exception on the candle I I cannot understand.

01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400
I I cannot understand.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.790
I I cannot understand. Um so if you want to communicate with

01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800
Um so if you want to communicate with

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.750
Um so if you want to communicate with the user then you use flash message and

01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760
the user then you use flash message and

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.470
the user then you use flash message and display a flash message. So the one

01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480
display a flash message. So the one

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.550
display a flash message. So the one that's coming from Symphona flashback.

01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560
that's coming from Symphona flashback.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.590
that's coming from Symphona flashback. So it will be seen uh in the storefront

01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600
So it will be seen uh in the storefront

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.109
So it will be seen uh in the storefront right but normally we just want to

01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119
right but normally we just want to

01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:09.430
right but normally we just want to display that something went wrong and

01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440
display that something went wrong and

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.470
display that something went wrong and the real error it's in your logs. So all

01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480
the real error it's in your logs. So all

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.510
the real error it's in your logs. So all the errors will be

01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520
the errors will be

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.669
the errors will be I understand wait. So about the section.

01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679
I understand wait. So about the section.

01:45:19.679 --> 01:45:25.270
I understand wait. So about the section. So we have uh um an order ordered list

01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280
So we have uh um an order ordered list

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.669
So we have uh um an order ordered list of actions which are executed one by one

01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679
of actions which are executed one by one

01:45:27.679 --> 01:45:32.629
of actions which are executed one by one and we see that um we cannot proceed and

01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639
and we see that um we cannot proceed and

01:45:32.639 --> 01:45:36.070
and we see that um we cannot proceed and uh or maybe on the step of conditions we

01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080
uh or maybe on the step of conditions we

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.950
uh or maybe on the step of conditions we we see that uh we we should throw an

01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960
we see that uh we we should throw an

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:41.990
we see that uh we we should throw an error and stop transition.

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000
error and stop transition.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.470
error and stop transition. Um

01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480
Um

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.629
Um how how should we

01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639
how how should we

01:45:46.639 --> 01:45:48.709
how how should we the conditions

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719
the conditions

01:45:48.719 --> 01:45:51.270
the conditions are only to do the check. So here you

01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280
are only to do the check. So here you

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.790
are only to do the check. So here you cannot uh like the only error you will

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800
cannot uh like the only error you will

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.430
cannot uh like the only error you will get in the storefront in the application

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440
get in the storefront in the application

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.709
get in the storefront in the application is that this transition cannot be uh

01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719
is that this transition cannot be uh

01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:03.350
is that this transition cannot be uh executed. Okay. So if you click the

01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360
executed. Okay. So if you click the

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.070
executed. Okay. So if you click the button and those conditions are not met,

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080
button and those conditions are not met,

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.430
button and those conditions are not met, you will only get um information that

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440
you will only get um information that

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.709
you will only get um information that transition cannot be done. Uh so

01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719
transition cannot be done. Uh so

01:46:12.719 --> 01:46:15.350
transition cannot be done. Uh so so it will be rised automatically. Yeah.

01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360
so it will be rised automatically. Yeah.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.229
so it will be rised automatically. Yeah. If conditions not met then uh I got

01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239
If conditions not met then uh I got

01:46:18.239 --> 01:46:19.669
If conditions not met then uh I got there. Okay.

01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679
there. Okay.

01:46:19.679 --> 01:46:21.430
there. Okay. And if you want to do something like

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440
And if you want to do something like

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.750
And if you want to do something like this that for example leave conditions

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760
this that for example leave conditions

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.229
this that for example leave conditions empty and then in actions check

01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239
empty and then in actions check

01:46:26.239 --> 01:46:28.870
empty and then in actions check something and if something happens then

01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880
something and if something happens then

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.270
something and if something happens then display a message. So here in the action

01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280
display a message. So here in the action

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.390
display a message. So here in the action section you can also uh add conditions.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400
section you can also uh add conditions.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:42.709
section you can also uh add conditions. Um not sure if I have oh here

01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719
Um not sure if I have oh here

01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:45.030
Um not sure if I have oh here okay so we are actually those are pre-

01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040
okay so we are actually those are pre-

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.310
okay so we are actually those are pre- actions but the idea is the same. So we

01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320
actions but the idea is the same. So we

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.470
actions but the idea is the same. So we are doing executing some method and here

01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480
are doing executing some method and here

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:55.510
are doing executing some method and here we can also pass conditions. So we are

01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520
we can also pass conditions. So we are

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.709
we can also pass conditions. So we are in actions but we can do for example uh

01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719
in actions but we can do for example uh

01:46:58.719 --> 01:47:02.229
in actions but we can do for example uh this when some value is true and

01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239
this when some value is true and

01:47:02.239 --> 01:47:07.669
this when some value is true and something other when some value is false

01:47:07.679 --> 01:47:11.669
or they say that cancel action

01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679
or they say that cancel action

01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:15.990
or they say that cancel action is it does it cancel the

01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000
is it does it cancel the

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.030
is it does it cancel the no no those are executed and here you

01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040
no no those are executed and here you

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.830
no no those are executed and here you only communicate and decide if you want

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840
only communicate and decide if you want

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:24.229
only communicate and decide if you want to do something or not. So basically the

01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239
to do something or not. So basically the

01:47:24.239 --> 01:47:26.390
to do something or not. So basically the only check is in the conditions. If the

01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400
only check is in the conditions. If the

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.350
only check is in the conditions. If the conditions are uh met then all the

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360
conditions are uh met then all the

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.590
conditions are uh met then all the actions will be executed one by one or

01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600
actions will be executed one by one or

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.830
actions will be executed one by one or for example in this case we have plenty

01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840
for example in this case we have plenty

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.310
for example in this case we have plenty of actions but this one will be only

01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320
of actions but this one will be only

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.390
of actions but this one will be only executed from time to time because it

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400
executed from time to time because it

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.870
executed from time to time because it has additional condition but this

01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880
has additional condition but this

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.350
has additional condition but this condition will stop only from this to

01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360
condition will stop only from this to

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.109
condition will stop only from this to happening. It will not throw any error

01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119
happening. It will not throw any error

01:47:47.119 --> 01:47:49.669
happening. It will not throw any error or anything. Uh so this may happen or

01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679
or anything. Uh so this may happen or

01:47:49.679 --> 01:47:55.750
or anything. Uh so this may happen or may not but we'll always go further.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.430
Um and uh in case of exception in one of

01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440
Um and uh in case of exception in one of

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.109
Um and uh in case of exception in one of these uh

01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119
these uh

01:48:01.119 --> 01:48:03.189
these uh the full transition will be rever

01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199
the full transition will be rever

01:48:03.199 --> 01:48:05.830
the full transition will be rever reverted to the beginning. No action

01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840
reverted to the beginning. No action

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.669
reverted to the beginning. No action will be at the end done because it's all

01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679
will be at the end done because it's all

01:48:09.679 --> 01:48:11.830
will be at the end done because it's all or nothing.

01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840
or nothing.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.669
or nothing. Okay, that's what I wanted to

01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679
Okay, that's what I wanted to

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.990
Okay, that's what I wanted to understand. All or nothing. Okay. Mhm.

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000
understand. All or nothing. Okay. Mhm.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.990
understand. All or nothing. Okay. Mhm. So if any exception happens anywhere

01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000
So if any exception happens anywhere

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.709
So if any exception happens anywhere here during those actions, you will just

01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719
here during those actions, you will just

01:48:20.719 --> 01:48:23.030
here during those actions, you will just have an error in the storefront of

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040
have an error in the storefront of

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.830
have an error in the storefront of details in logs and nothing will be

01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840
details in logs and nothing will be

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.510
details in logs and nothing will be done. Your um entity will be in the

01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520
done. Your um entity will be in the

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.350
done. Your um entity will be in the previous step in the step that you

01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360
previous step in the step that you

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.790
previous step in the step that you started from.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:40.310
All right. Thank you.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:44.790
Okay.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.310
Any other questions to actions and so

01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320
Any other questions to actions and so

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.550
Any other questions to actions and so on?

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.870
Okay, if not guys, let's do the break

01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880
Okay, if not guys, let's do the break

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:57.830
Okay, if not guys, let's do the break because uh yeah, it's been already a

01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840
because uh yeah, it's been already a

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.870
because uh yeah, it's been already a long time. Uh so I still have um some

01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880
long time. Uh so I still have um some

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.830
long time. Uh so I still have um some other elements to show you because those

01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840
other elements to show you because those

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.149
other elements to show you because those actions are not only for the workflow.

01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159
actions are not only for the workflow.

01:49:08.159 --> 01:49:10.709
actions are not only for the workflow. They can be used in many many places but

01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719
They can be used in many many places but

01:49:10.719 --> 01:49:14.629
They can be used in many many places but that's uh complicated too complicated to

01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639
that's uh complicated too complicated to

01:49:14.639 --> 01:49:18.390
that's uh complicated too complicated to explain it fast. So let's do a break. 15

01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400
explain it fast. So let's do a break. 15

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.430
explain it fast. So let's do a break. 15 minutes will be enough for you and we'll

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440
minutes will be enough for you and we'll

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.830
minutes will be enough for you and we'll be back in 15 minutes and finish this

01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840
be back in 15 minutes and finish this

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:31.109
be back in 15 minutes and finish this topic.

01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:46.149
Guys, are you back?

01:49:46.159 --> 01:49:48.629
Okay,

01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639
Okay,

01:49:48.639 --> 01:49:58.790
Okay, I see one uh Nick Vir.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:07.910
Okay, let's wait moment.

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.910
Okay.

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.390
Okay. So, we're almost over here. Uh

01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400
Okay. So, we're almost over here. Uh

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.030
Okay. So, we're almost over here. Uh yeah, let's continue then.

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040
yeah, let's continue then.

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.149
yeah, let's continue then. Um

01:50:24.159 --> 01:50:26.790
uh okay so those actions and those

01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800
uh okay so those actions and those

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.709
uh okay so those actions and those conditions that I've just shown you they

01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719
conditions that I've just shown you they

01:50:28.719 --> 01:50:31.510
conditions that I've just shown you they are not created for the workflow itself.

01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520
are not created for the workflow itself.

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.750
are not created for the workflow itself. There are some local functionalities

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760
There are some local functionalities

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.709
There are some local functionalities that can be also used in uh other places

01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719
that can be also used in uh other places

01:50:36.719 --> 01:50:38.550
that can be also used in uh other places and I'm going to show you two more

01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560
and I'm going to show you two more

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.950
and I'm going to show you two more places where you can use those actions

01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960
places where you can use those actions

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:43.430
places where you can use those actions and conditions. Uh there is the slide

01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440
and conditions. Uh there is the slide

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.510
and conditions. Uh there is the slide about translation but we already talked

01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520
about translation but we already talked

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.510
about translation but we already talked about it that it's in separate file and

01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520
about it that it's in separate file and

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.229
about it that it's in separate file and this is how to dump it.

01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239
this is how to dump it.

01:50:50.239 --> 01:50:52.870
this is how to dump it. So those actions and conditions can be

01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880
So those actions and conditions can be

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.470
So those actions and conditions can be also used in uh operations and processes

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480
also used in uh operations and processes

01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:59.510
also used in uh operations and processes and those are two functionalities uh

01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520
and those are two functionalities uh

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.590
and those are two functionalities uh from Oro. So those are custom

01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:01.600
from Oro. So those are custom

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.470
from Oro. So those are custom functionalities that we created.

01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480
functionalities that we created.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.350
functionalities that we created. Uh so for the operations

01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360
Uh so for the operations

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.950
Uh so for the operations uh

01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960
uh

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.669
uh this is basically how the delete button

01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679
this is basically how the delete button

01:51:11.679 --> 01:51:14.790
this is basically how the delete button appeared uh on your data grid and on

01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800
appeared uh on your data grid and on

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.149
appeared uh on your data grid and on your view page uh with this operation.

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159
your view page uh with this operation.

01:51:18.159 --> 01:51:21.030
your view page uh with this operation. Uh so basically they are defined in the

01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040
Uh so basically they are defined in the

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.709
Uh so basically they are defined in the actions yaml file. Sorry for some reason

01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719
actions yaml file. Sorry for some reason

01:51:26.719 --> 01:51:31.350
actions yaml file. Sorry for some reason there's no name here. I will fix it on

01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360
there's no name here. I will fix it on

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.590
there's no name here. I will fix it on the next slides.

01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600
the next slides.

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.830
the next slides. Uh so they are defined in the actions

01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840
Uh so they are defined in the actions

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.950
Uh so they are defined in the actions yellow file uh and it's inside resources

01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960
yellow file uh and it's inside resources

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:41.030
yellow file uh and it's inside resources config oro. So this will this is oro

01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040
config oro. So this will this is oro

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.709
config oro. So this will this is oro functionality. So basically inside

01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719
functionality. So basically inside

01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:45.270
functionality. So basically inside resources config oro and those actions

01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280
resources config oro and those actions

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.790
resources config oro and those actions will be automatically loaded for you in

01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800
will be automatically loaded for you in

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.750
will be automatically loaded for you in this uh in the actions yl file you can

01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760
this uh in the actions yl file you can

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.709
this uh in the actions yl file you can specify some particular operation uh and

01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719
specify some particular operation uh and

01:51:54.719 --> 01:51:56.709
specify some particular operation uh and this will be interaction with the user.

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719
this will be interaction with the user.

01:51:56.719 --> 01:51:59.189
this will be interaction with the user. So at the end this will be displayed as

01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199
So at the end this will be displayed as

01:51:59.199 --> 01:52:02.149
So at the end this will be displayed as a button and you'll be able to click it

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159
a button and you'll be able to click it

01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:04.950
a button and you'll be able to click it and this operation can be added to a

01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960
and this operation can be added to a

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.270
and this operation can be added to a route or to a data grid. So for example

01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280
route or to a data grid. So for example

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:09.430
route or to a data grid. So for example the delete button was added to all data

01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440
the delete button was added to all data

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.350
the delete button was added to all data grids. Uh so this is how you get the

01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360
grids. Uh so this is how you get the

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.629
grids. Uh so this is how you get the delete button on your data grid and for

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639
delete button on your data grid and for

01:52:16.639 --> 01:52:19.510
delete button on your data grid and for some specific routes.

01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520
some specific routes.

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:22.310
some specific routes. Uh and at the end this is a button or

01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320
Uh and at the end this is a button or

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.470
Uh and at the end this is a button or basically a link. So this is some

01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480
basically a link. So this is some

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:26.550
basically a link. So this is some element that allows you to interact with

01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560
element that allows you to interact with

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.109
element that allows you to interact with the user and user needs to perform some

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119
the user and user needs to perform some

01:52:29.119 --> 01:52:31.910
the user and user needs to perform some action which is clicking basically and

01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920
action which is clicking basically and

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.950
action which is clicking basically and here we also use actions and conditions

01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960
here we also use actions and conditions

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.830
here we also use actions and conditions and I will actually actually uh present

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840
and I will actually actually uh present

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:40.550
and I will actually actually uh present this to you on one example called or

01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560
this to you on one example called or

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.750
this to you on one example called or order mark as shipped. So if you go to

01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760
order mark as shipped. So if you go to

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:46.149
order mark as shipped. So if you go to our orders

01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159
our orders

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:50.870
our orders and open any order

01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.790
uh there is this mark as shipped button

01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800
uh there is this mark as shipped button

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.430
uh there is this mark as shipped button and this is not a workflow bar. This is

01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440
and this is not a workflow bar. This is

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:58.390
and this is not a workflow bar. This is just a button displayed here and this

01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400
just a button displayed here and this

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.390
just a button displayed here and this particular button it's actually going to

01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400
particular button it's actually going to

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.870
particular button it's actually going to mark our order as shipped when I click

01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880
mark our order as shipped when I click

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.430
mark our order as shipped when I click it. And this implementation sits inside

01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440
it. And this implementation sits inside

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.270
it. And this implementation sits inside our this is an operation.

01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280
our this is an operation.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:14.149
our this is an operation. So this operation I will close all this

01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159
So this operation I will close all this

01:53:14.159 --> 01:53:16.950
So this operation I will close all this is called oro order mark as shipped and

01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960
is called oro order mark as shipped and

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:19.830
is called oro order mark as shipped and let's see how to

01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840
let's see how to

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.470
let's see how to uh create it.

01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480
uh create it.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.589
uh create it. So we are inside resources config oro

01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599
So we are inside resources config oro

01:53:25.599 --> 01:53:30.950
So we are inside resources config oro I'm inside actions yl file and here

01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960
I'm inside actions yl file and here

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.109
I'm inside actions yl file and here we need to specify all our actions

01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119
we need to specify all our actions

01:53:33.119 --> 01:53:36.070
we need to specify all our actions inside operations namespace and you can

01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080
inside operations namespace and you can

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.430
inside operations namespace and you can have multiple you can have many of them

01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440
have multiple you can have many of them

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:43.750
have multiple you can have many of them and uh the name needs to be unique

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760
and uh the name needs to be unique

01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:49.030
and uh the name needs to be unique then my

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.229
or order mark as shipped. So uh this

01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239
or order mark as shipped. So uh this

01:53:52.239 --> 01:53:54.870
or order mark as shipped. So uh this particular element

01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880
particular element

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.910
particular element will have some label and label is mark

01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920
will have some label and label is mark

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.550
will have some label and label is mark as shift which is

01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560
as shift which is

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:04.550
as shift which is correct.

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560
correct.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:08.149
correct. Then

01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:10.790
uh it's enabled because you can enable

01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800
uh it's enabled because you can enable

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.750
uh it's enabled because you can enable disable it applications default this

01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760
disable it applications default this

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.229
disable it applications default this means back office and then you specify

01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239
means back office and then you specify

01:54:16.239 --> 01:54:18.149
means back office and then you specify where this particular button should be

01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159
where this particular button should be

01:54:18.159 --> 01:54:21.430
where this particular button should be rendered and here we specify that uh on

01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440
rendered and here we specify that uh on

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.109
rendered and here we specify that uh on some particular route which is oro

01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119
some particular route which is oro

01:54:23.119 --> 01:54:25.510
some particular route which is oro orderer view route that leads to or

01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520
orderer view route that leads to or

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.669
orderer view route that leads to or order view page and we are on a orderer

01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679
order view page and we are on a orderer

01:54:27.679 --> 01:54:30.070
order view page and we are on a orderer view page and you can double check the

01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080
view page and you can double check the

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.589
view page and you can double check the route here it's or order view. So this

01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599
route here it's or order view. So this

01:54:33.599 --> 01:54:36.149
route here it's or order view. So this is how we said that this particular uh

01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159
is how we said that this particular uh

01:54:36.159 --> 01:54:39.270
is how we said that this particular uh button should be rendered here. Uh then

01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280
button should be rendered here. Uh then

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.070
button should be rendered here. Uh then we are also restricting it with some uh

01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080
we are also restricting it with some uh

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.709
we are also restricting it with some uh ACL. So if I don't have access to update

01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719
ACL. So if I don't have access to update

01:54:44.719 --> 01:54:47.270
ACL. So if I don't have access to update orders then I will not see this button

01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280
orders then I will not see this button

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.950
orders then I will not see this button at all. Right? Because I cannot update

01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960
at all. Right? Because I cannot update

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.350
at all. Right? Because I cannot update order which makes sense to not be able

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360
order which makes sense to not be able

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.390
order which makes sense to not be able to mark it as shipped. You can also pass

01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400
to mark it as shipped. You can also pass

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.990
to mark it as shipped. You can also pass some additional options. Um for example

01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000
some additional options. Um for example

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.270
some additional options. Um for example an icon and this is exactly this check

01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280
an icon and this is exactly this check

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.589
an icon and this is exactly this check icon. here

01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599
icon. here

01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:05.430
icon. here and then here we have actually

01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440
and then here we have actually

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.260
and then here we have actually preconditions.

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:07.270
preconditions.

01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:08.629
preconditions. [Music]

01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639
[Music]

01:55:08.639 --> 01:55:12.149
[Music] So you have also four elements

01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159
So you have also four elements

01:55:12.159 --> 01:55:14.629
So you have also four elements actions uh pre-actions preconditions

01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639
actions uh pre-actions preconditions

01:55:14.639 --> 01:55:16.790
actions uh pre-actions preconditions conditions and actions exactly the same

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800
conditions and actions exactly the same

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.830
conditions and actions exactly the same as in workflow. So preconditions go

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840
as in workflow. So preconditions go

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:21.990
as in workflow. So preconditions go before the button is rendered. My

01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000
before the button is rendered. My

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.350
before the button is rendered. My precondition here is that the status of

01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360
precondition here is that the status of

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:30.149
precondition here is that the status of my order needs to be open. Okay. So

01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159
my order needs to be open. Okay. So

01:55:30.159 --> 01:55:32.790
my order needs to be open. Okay. So status of this order is open. So I see

01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800
status of this order is open. So I see

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.270
status of this order is open. So I see this button. But when I now go to some

01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280
this button. But when I now go to some

01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:37.830
this button. But when I now go to some other order that it's not open. Let's

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840
other order that it's not open. Let's

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.550
other order that it's not open. Let's list all the orders

01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560
list all the orders

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:43.430
list all the orders uh archived for example. Then this

01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440
uh archived for example. Then this

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.589
uh archived for example. Then this button is not here because the

01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599
button is not here because the

01:55:45.599 --> 01:55:48.470
button is not here because the precondition was not met. So the button

01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480
precondition was not met. So the button

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.950
precondition was not met. So the button is not even rendered.

01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960
is not even rendered.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.030
is not even rendered. But when actually the precondition is

01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040
But when actually the precondition is

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.589
But when actually the precondition is met and the button is rendered. So let's

01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599
met and the button is rendered. So let's

01:55:55.599 --> 01:55:59.189
met and the button is rendered. So let's go back to any open order again. this

01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199
go back to any open order again. this

01:55:59.199 --> 01:56:01.350
go back to any open order again. this button is rendered and that's it for

01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360
button is rendered and that's it for

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.870
button is rendered and that's it for now. Then whenever I click this button

01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880
now. Then whenever I click this button

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.109
now. Then whenever I click this button whatever is defined inside the action

01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119
whatever is defined inside the action

01:56:07.119 --> 01:56:10.229
whatever is defined inside the action section will happen. So what we are

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239
section will happen. So what we are

01:56:10.239 --> 01:56:13.350
section will happen. So what we are doing here will we are fetching the

01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360
doing here will we are fetching the

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:17.030
doing here will we are fetching the shipped status and saving it to internal

01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040
shipped status and saving it to internal

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.470
shipped status and saving it to internal status of our entity. So order status

01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480
status of our entity. So order status

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.109
status of our entity. So order status will be changed to shipped. We are

01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119
will be changed to shipped. We are

01:56:23.119 --> 01:56:25.510
will be changed to shipped. We are flashing this entity to the database. So

01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520
flashing this entity to the database. So

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.229
flashing this entity to the database. So we are saving this and displaying fresh

01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239
we are saving this and displaying fresh

01:56:28.239 --> 01:56:31.189
we are saving this and displaying fresh message info type. So it will be blue

01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199
message info type. So it will be blue

01:56:31.199 --> 01:56:34.709
message info type. So it will be blue and the message will tell us that order

01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719
and the message will tell us that order

01:56:34.719 --> 01:56:37.910
and the message will tell us that order with this ID has been marked as shipped

01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920
with this ID has been marked as shipped

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:41.430
with this ID has been marked as shipped and this ID parameter this is our order

01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440
and this ID parameter this is our order

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.990
and this ID parameter this is our order identifier. So let's see if this

01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000
identifier. So let's see if this

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.589
identifier. So let's see if this happens.

01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599
happens.

01:56:45.599 --> 01:56:48.070
happens. My status is open

01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080
My status is open

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.350
My status is open and my order identifier is this. So I'm

01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360
and my order identifier is this. So I'm

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:54.070
and my order identifier is this. So I'm clicking mark as shipped.

01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080
clicking mark as shipped.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.550
clicking mark as shipped. I have this message order has been

01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560
I have this message order has been

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.550
I have this message order has been marked as shipped

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560
marked as shipped

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.629
marked as shipped and my internal status was changed to

01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639
and my internal status was changed to

01:57:00.639 --> 01:57:03.109
and my internal status was changed to shipped page was reloaded and this

01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119
shipped page was reloaded and this

01:57:03.119 --> 01:57:05.109
shipped page was reloaded and this button is not here anymore because it's

01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119
button is not here anymore because it's

01:57:05.119 --> 01:57:09.750
button is not here anymore because it's available only for open orders. So with

01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760
available only for open orders. So with

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.149
available only for open orders. So with this little

01:57:14.159 --> 01:57:15.669
fragment,

01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679
fragment,

01:57:15.679 --> 01:57:18.149
fragment, we just created

01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159
we just created

01:57:18.159 --> 01:57:20.629
we just created uh a button that will change a status

01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639
uh a button that will change a status

01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:23.350
uh a button that will change a status for our order and display a flash

01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360
for our order and display a flash

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.870
for our order and display a flash message.

01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880
message.

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.350
message. So with really short amount of code, you

01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360
So with really short amount of code, you

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.669
So with really short amount of code, you can do some

01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679
can do some

01:57:29.679 --> 01:57:32.310
can do some nice actions.

01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320
nice actions.

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.470
nice actions. And if you want to check the all

01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480
And if you want to check the all

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.629
And if you want to check the all available

01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639
available

01:57:36.639 --> 01:57:39.510
available elements for our actions here you have

01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520
elements for our actions here you have

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.990
elements for our actions here you have documentation. So basically from the

01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000
documentation. So basically from the

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.149
documentation. So basically from the most important parts are

01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159
most important parts are

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:48.870
most important parts are uh the entities that you want this uh

01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880
uh the entities that you want this uh

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.030
uh the entities that you want this uh operation to bound to. If you specify

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040
operation to bound to. If you specify

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:53.510
operation to bound to. If you specify entity class uh this will have be

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520
entity class uh this will have be

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.830
entity class uh this will have be displayed on the entity view page. So we

01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840
displayed on the entity view page. So we

01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:01.109
displayed on the entity view page. So we can also go with a route. Uh and you can

01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119
can also go with a route. Uh and you can

01:58:01.119 --> 01:58:05.750
can also go with a route. Uh and you can specify.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:13.030
Okay. Why it's not here?

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:15.189
You can also specify for all entities.

01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199
You can also specify for all entities.

01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:17.030
You can also specify for all entities. For some reason it's not in the

01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040
For some reason it's not in the

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.709
For some reason it's not in the documentation,

01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719
documentation,

01:58:18.719 --> 01:58:20.870
documentation, but you can also specify that this is

01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880
but you can also specify that this is

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:26.390
but you can also specify that this is for all entities or for all data grids.

01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400
for all entities or for all data grids.

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.629
for all entities or for all data grids. Then for the button you can have some

01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639
Then for the button you can have some

01:58:28.639 --> 01:58:31.030
Then for the button you can have some additional options. You can even bind JS

01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040
additional options. You can even bind JS

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.189
additional options. You can even bind JS component to it.

01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199
component to it.

01:58:33.199 --> 01:58:34.709
component to it. And

01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719
And

01:58:34.719 --> 01:58:37.270
And from the most important parts are

01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280
from the most important parts are

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.990
from the most important parts are basically our preconditions, conditions,

01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000
basically our preconditions, conditions,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.830
basically our preconditions, conditions, pre-actions and actions. Uh

01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840
pre-actions and actions. Uh

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.750
pre-actions and actions. Uh and because those operations are also

01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760
and because those operations are also

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:48.470
and because those operations are also rendered on the data grid, you may have

01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480
rendered on the data grid, you may have

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:50.310
rendered on the data grid, you may have uh you may want to specify some

01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320
uh you may want to specify some

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.790
uh you may want to specify some additional elements. But most of all,

01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800
additional elements. But most of all,

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.550
additional elements. But most of all, you will basically play around with

01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560
you will basically play around with

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.390
you will basically play around with whatever you have in actions,

01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400
whatever you have in actions,

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.189
whatever you have in actions, preactions, preconditions and specify

01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199
preactions, preconditions and specify

01:58:59.199 --> 01:59:02.070
preactions, preconditions and specify where to put this particular uh button

01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080
where to put this particular uh button

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.030
where to put this particular uh button with uh this part. If we have multiple

01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040
with uh this part. If we have multiple

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.510
with uh this part. If we have multiple buttons uh on the same page like we have

01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520
buttons uh on the same page like we have

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.109
buttons uh on the same page like we have here,

01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119
here,

01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:11.510
here, uh then you can also specify order for

01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520
uh then you can also specify order for

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.669
uh then you can also specify order for them.

01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679
them.

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:15.589
them. Um

01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599
Um

01:59:15.599 --> 01:59:19.990
Um yep.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.030
And the second element that you can use

01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040
And the second element that you can use

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.189
And the second element that you can use those actions and conditions in are

01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199
those actions and conditions in are

01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:28.229
those actions and conditions in are processes. So process uh this is also

01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239
processes. So process uh this is also

01:59:28.239 --> 01:59:31.270
processes. So process uh this is also custom thing in Oro and uh this is kind

01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280
custom thing in Oro and uh this is kind

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:34.149
custom thing in Oro and uh this is kind of a event listener that is configured

01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159
of a event listener that is configured

01:59:34.159 --> 01:59:40.790
of a event listener that is configured from YAML. Uh so we can um create a

01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800
from YAML. Uh so we can um create a

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:43.109
from YAML. Uh so we can um create a process that will be executed when the

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119
process that will be executed when the

01:59:43.119 --> 01:59:46.550
process that will be executed when the entity is created, updated, deleted or

01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560
entity is created, updated, deleted or

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.950
entity is created, updated, deleted or some specific fields of this entity is

01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960
some specific fields of this entity is

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:52.229
some specific fields of this entity is updated. So same as for entity event

01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239
updated. So same as for entity event

01:59:52.239 --> 01:59:55.189
updated. So same as for entity event listeners but also here we can specify

01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199
listeners but also here we can specify

01:59:55.199 --> 01:59:56.870
listeners but also here we can specify the chrome definition whenever this

01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880
the chrome definition whenever this

01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.510
the chrome definition whenever this process should happen. The configuration

01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520
process should happen. The configuration

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:02.229
process should happen. The configuration file is inside processes yl file in the

02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239
file is inside processes yl file in the

02:00:02.239 --> 02:00:03.910
file is inside processes yl file in the resources config oraura. So it is

02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920
resources config oraura. So it is

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:06.550
resources config oraura. So it is autoloaded by one of our bundles. And

02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560
autoloaded by one of our bundles. And

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.390
autoloaded by one of our bundles. And here the um nice thing uh that will be

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400
here the um nice thing uh that will be

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.990
here the um nice thing uh that will be actually hard to implement with the

02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000
actually hard to implement with the

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.149
actually hard to implement with the event listener because event listener is

02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159
event listener because event listener is

02:00:14.159 --> 02:00:17.990
event listener because event listener is executed exactly at the time when entity

02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000
executed exactly at the time when entity

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.189
executed exactly at the time when entity is edited or updated. Here you can

02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199
is edited or updated. Here you can

02:00:21.199 --> 02:00:23.589
is edited or updated. Here you can specify the time shift. So for example

02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599
specify the time shift. So for example

02:00:23.599 --> 02:00:25.990
specify the time shift. So for example you can create a process that will

02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000
you can create a process that will

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.189
you can create a process that will listen on order

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199
listen on order

02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:31.189
listen on order creation

02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199
creation

02:00:31.199 --> 02:00:35.589
creation and

02:00:35.599 --> 02:00:37.589
No. Uh for example, you can create a

02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599
No. Uh for example, you can create a

02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:40.790
No. Uh for example, you can create a process where uh that will listen on the

02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800
process where uh that will listen on the

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.430
process where uh that will listen on the customer user creation. So whenever you

02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440
customer user creation. So whenever you

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.750
customer user creation. So whenever you register in the storefront there is

02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760
register in the storefront there is

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.189
register in the storefront there is customer user uh created for you and you

02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199
customer user uh created for you and you

02:00:49.199 --> 02:00:51.030
customer user uh created for you and you create a process that listens to

02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040
create a process that listens to

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.910
create a process that listens to creation of customer user entity and for

02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920
creation of customer user entity and for

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.310
creation of customer user entity and for example time shifted with the 60 minutes

02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320
example time shifted with the 60 minutes

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.629
example time shifted with the 60 minutes and after 60 minutes check if this

02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639
and after 60 minutes check if this

02:00:58.639 --> 02:01:02.310
and after 60 minutes check if this customer user didn't cling click the

02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320
customer user didn't cling click the

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.790
customer user didn't cling click the link from email they resent some email.

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800
link from email they resent some email.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:07.589
link from email they resent some email. Okay, so this is hard to implement with

02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599
Okay, so this is hard to implement with

02:01:07.599 --> 02:01:09.830
Okay, so this is hard to implement with uh event listener but here you can

02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840
uh event listener but here you can

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:13.030
uh event listener but here you can basically implement say send email and

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040
basically implement say send email and

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.990
basically implement say send email and just specify time shift to be 16 minutes

02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000
just specify time shift to be 16 minutes

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.270
just specify time shift to be 16 minutes and here to do all this to check if the

02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280
and here to do all this to check if the

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.870
and here to do all this to check if the customer user uh is confirmed or not and

02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880
customer user uh is confirmed or not and

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.870
customer user uh is confirmed or not and to send additional email or do some

02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880
to send additional email or do some

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.709
to send additional email or do some other um actions we have actions and

02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719
other um actions we have actions and

02:01:30.719 --> 02:01:32.870
other um actions we have actions and conditions block. So uh for the

02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880
conditions block. So uh for the

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.790
conditions block. So uh for the operations and for workflows we actually

02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800
operations and for workflows we actually

02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:38.709
operations and for workflows we actually had four blocks but here we don't have

02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719
had four blocks but here we don't have

02:01:38.719 --> 02:01:40.950
had four blocks but here we don't have anything that happens before because we

02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960
anything that happens before because we

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.790
anything that happens before because we are not rendering any button or

02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800
are not rendering any button or

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.990
are not rendering any button or anything. So basically whenever

02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000
anything. So basically whenever

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.550
anything. So basically whenever some trigger happens we are checking

02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560
some trigger happens we are checking

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.870
some trigger happens we are checking conditions and if they are met we are

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880
conditions and if they are met we are

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:54.550
conditions and if they are met we are executing actions.

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.350
Uh let me go to documentation. It has

02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360
Uh let me go to documentation. It has

02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:00.550
Uh let me go to documentation. It has actually really nice

02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560
actually really nice

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.550
actually really nice um

02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560
um

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.550
um list of elements. So inside processes uh

02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560
list of elements. So inside processes uh

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.589
list of elements. So inside processes uh YAML file under the processes name space

02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599
YAML file under the processes name space

02:02:09.599 --> 02:02:11.990
YAML file under the processes name space we have two sections. First you define

02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000
we have two sections. First you define

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.870
we have two sections. First you define some process and then you define where

02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880
some process and then you define where

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:16.950
some process and then you define where when those this process should be

02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960
when those this process should be

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.189
when those this process should be triggered. So this is a process name and

02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199
triggered. So this is a process name and

02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:23.430
triggered. So this is a process name and uh it can have some label because in the

02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440
uh it can have some label because in the

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.270
uh it can have some label because in the UI in the back office we have actually a

02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280
UI in the back office we have actually a

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.750
UI in the back office we have actually a list of all the processes.

02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760
list of all the processes.

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.390
list of all the processes. If it's enabled it needs to be bound to

02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400
If it's enabled it needs to be bound to

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.470
If it's enabled it needs to be bound to some entity. Uh if we have multiple uh

02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480
some entity. Uh if we have multiple uh

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.189
some entity. Uh if we have multiple uh definitions bound to the same entity

02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199
definitions bound to the same entity

02:02:37.199 --> 02:02:39.589
definitions bound to the same entity then you can order them. Exclude

02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599
then you can order them. Exclude

02:02:39.599 --> 02:02:41.750
then you can order them. Exclude definition is usually our definition. So

02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760
definition is usually our definition. So

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.510
definition is usually our definition. So it will not be triggered once more

02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520
it will not be triggered once more

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:46.390
it will not be triggered once more whenever this is still happening. And

02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400
whenever this is still happening. And

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.430
whenever this is still happening. And then whenever whenever triggers happens

02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440
then whenever whenever triggers happens

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.589
then whenever whenever triggers happens we are checking preconditions and here

02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599
we are checking preconditions and here

02:02:51.599 --> 02:02:54.229
we are checking preconditions and here you can use all the

02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239
you can use all the

02:02:54.239 --> 02:02:57.109
you can use all the conditions uh all the aliases that you

02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119
conditions uh all the aliases that you

02:02:57.119 --> 02:02:59.270
conditions uh all the aliases that you already saw in workflows and in

02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280
already saw in workflows and in

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.790
already saw in workflows and in operations

02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800
operations

02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:03.189
operations and uh

02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199
and uh

02:03:03.199 --> 02:03:05.750
and uh when those are met we are executing

02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760
when those are met we are executing

02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:07.910
when those are met we are executing actions. So the only difference is the

02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920
actions. So the only difference is the

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.229
actions. So the only difference is the difference of those blocks. Okay. The

02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239
difference of those blocks. Okay. The

02:03:10.239 --> 02:03:12.629
difference of those blocks. Okay. The conditions are called preconditions and

02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639
conditions are called preconditions and

02:03:12.639 --> 02:03:14.470
conditions are called preconditions and actions are called actions

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480
actions are called actions

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.709
actions are called actions configuration. And here you can do

02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719
configuration. And here you can do

02:03:16.719 --> 02:03:19.109
configuration. And here you can do pretty much anything.

02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119
pretty much anything.

02:03:19.119 --> 02:03:22.229
pretty much anything. So use all those actions in here.

02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239
So use all those actions in here.

02:03:22.239 --> 02:03:27.430
So use all those actions in here. Uh and in the triggers section for my

02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440
Uh and in the triggers section for my

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.229
Uh and in the triggers section for my process. Uh here you have actually

02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239
process. Uh here you have actually

02:03:30.239 --> 02:03:32.629
process. Uh here you have actually multiple. In real life it's never this

02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639
multiple. In real life it's never this

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:34.950
multiple. In real life it's never this way. It's just documentation. So we

02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960
way. It's just documentation. So we

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.149
way. It's just documentation. So we listed all the options you have. Uh so

02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159
listed all the options you have. Uh so

02:03:38.159 --> 02:03:40.550
listed all the options you have. Uh so you can create a trigger that will

02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560
you can create a trigger that will

02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.550
you can create a trigger that will listen to create event on our entity

02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560
listen to create event on our entity

02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:47.750
listen to create event on our entity uh or update event or update event but

02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760
uh or update event or update event but

02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:50.229
uh or update event or update event but some particular field.

02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239
some particular field.

02:03:50.239 --> 02:03:54.310
some particular field. And then if you like this to happen uh

02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320
And then if you like this to happen uh

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.229
And then if you like this to happen uh through the message Q then uh

02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239
through the message Q then uh

02:03:58.239 --> 02:04:00.070
through the message Q then uh if you want this to have a time shift

02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:00.080
if you want this to have a time shift

02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.510
if you want this to have a time shift actually this needs to be pushed through

02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520
actually this needs to be pushed through

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:03.990
actually this needs to be pushed through the message Q. Okay. So the message is

02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000
the message Q. Okay. So the message is

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.990
the message Q. Okay. So the message is created instantly but this message on

02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000
created instantly but this message on

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.470
created instantly but this message on the message Q have delay of this time

02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480
the message Q have delay of this time

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.870
the message Q have delay of this time shift. Okay. And in this case you need

02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880
shift. Okay. And in this case you need

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:14.070
shift. Okay. And in this case you need to specify cute true and time shift uh

02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:14.080
to specify cute true and time shift uh

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.390
to specify cute true and time shift uh 60 and this is actually seconds. So for

02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400
60 and this is actually seconds. So for

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:20.870
60 and this is actually seconds. So for hours this will be 3,600

02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880
hours this will be 3,600

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:25.030
hours this will be 3,600 but yeah basically it's by seconds

02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040
but yeah basically it's by seconds

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:27.189
but yeah basically it's by seconds and also you can trigger it with the

02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199
and also you can trigger it with the

02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:28.629
and also you can trigger it with the chrome definition. So that's the

02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639
chrome definition. So that's the

02:04:28.639 --> 02:04:32.550
chrome definition. So that's the standard chrome definition.

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.109
uh and the list of those processes uh

02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119
uh and the list of those processes uh

02:04:35.119 --> 02:04:39.669
uh and the list of those processes uh are available here

02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679
are available here

02:04:39.679 --> 02:04:43.270
are available here in the processes

02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280
in the processes

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:46.229
in the processes menu. So you have all the processes

02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239
menu. So you have all the processes

02:04:46.239 --> 02:04:48.550
menu. So you have all the processes defined that's not a lot of them only

02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560
defined that's not a lot of them only

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:51.109
defined that's not a lot of them only 16. And what is really nice also from

02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119
16. And what is really nice also from

02:04:51.119 --> 02:04:53.589
16. And what is really nice also from here comparing to creating an event

02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599
here comparing to creating an event

02:04:53.599 --> 02:04:55.990
here comparing to creating an event listener if you create an event listener

02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000
listener if you create an event listener

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.950
listener if you create an event listener in code it will be executed always. And

02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960
in code it will be executed always. And

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:01.109
in code it will be executed always. And to disable it, you will need to

02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119
to disable it, you will need to

02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:05.350
to disable it, you will need to basically change the code and um deploy

02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360
basically change the code and um deploy

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.390
basically change the code and um deploy it or while implementing it create some

02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400
it or while implementing it create some

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.149
it or while implementing it create some additional configuration value

02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159
additional configuration value

02:05:10.159 --> 02:05:11.910
additional configuration value somewhere. With process you

02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920
somewhere. With process you

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.070
somewhere. With process you automatically get the activate and

02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:14.080
automatically get the activate and

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.750
automatically get the activate and deactivate

02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760
deactivate

02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.229
deactivate uh method. So you can just basically

02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239
uh method. So you can just basically

02:05:18.239 --> 02:05:21.270
uh method. So you can just basically come here deactivate this process and it

02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280
come here deactivate this process and it

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:28.709
come here deactivate this process and it will not be happening.

02:05:28.719 --> 02:05:32.310
Okay. Uh any questions to operations or

02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320
Okay. Uh any questions to operations or

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:39.589
Okay. Uh any questions to operations or processes?

02:05:39.599 --> 02:05:42.709
So one last additional uh feature

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719
So one last additional uh feature

02:05:42.719 --> 02:05:45.030
So one last additional uh feature regarding the workflows themselves are

02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040
regarding the workflows themselves are

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:49.750
regarding the workflows themselves are scopes. Uh so you can specify a scope

02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760
scopes. Uh so you can specify a scope

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:54.070
scopes. Uh so you can specify a scope per workflow. Um so scope this is a set

02:05:54.070 --> 02:05:54.080
per workflow. Um so scope this is a set

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:58.390
per workflow. Um so scope this is a set of parameters that define define current

02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400
of parameters that define define current

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.550
of parameters that define define current state of your application. So this

02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560
state of your application. So this

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.830
state of your application. So this consists of a website customer ID

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.910
um and so on. So for example you have a

02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920
um and so on. So for example you have a

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.790
um and so on. So for example you have a workflow checkout workflow and you want

02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800
workflow checkout workflow and you want

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:15.189
workflow checkout workflow and you want to have totally separate checkout for

02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199
to have totally separate checkout for

02:06:15.199 --> 02:06:17.990
to have totally separate checkout for different website. Uh for example you

02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000
different website. Uh for example you

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.350
different website. Uh for example you have a B2C site and a B2B site. So you

02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360
have a B2C site and a B2B site. So you

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.910
have a B2C site and a B2B site. So you have two websites and you want one

02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920
have two websites and you want one

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.750
have two websites and you want one checkout workflow to be available for

02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760
checkout workflow to be available for

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:28.470
checkout workflow to be available for the B2B and totally other checkout

02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480
the B2B and totally other checkout

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.790
the B2B and totally other checkout workflow to be available for the B2C

02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800
workflow to be available for the B2C

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.790
workflow to be available for the B2C which makes sense because usually B2C

02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800
which makes sense because usually B2C

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.310
which makes sense because usually B2C checkouts are a little bit different

02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320
checkouts are a little bit different

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.350
checkouts are a little bit different than B2B. So you can do it with a scope

02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360
than B2B. So you can do it with a scope

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:40.790
than B2B. So you can do it with a scope scope field this will be for us website

02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800
scope field this will be for us website

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.510
scope field this will be for us website because ours we will um differentiate

02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520
because ours we will um differentiate

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:46.069
because ours we will um differentiate those workflows by the website. So here

02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079
those workflows by the website. So here

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:48.470
those workflows by the website. So here we will have a website and here we will

02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480
we will have a website and here we will

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:51.990
we will have a website and here we will pass the website ID. If I do this uh my

02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000
pass the website ID. If I do this uh my

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.149
pass the website ID. If I do this uh my workflow will be available only for this

02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159
workflow will be available only for this

02:06:54.159 --> 02:06:56.470
workflow will be available only for this website this particular and then we

02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480
website this particular and then we

02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.709
website this particular and then we create other and specify websites and

02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719
create other and specify websites and

02:06:58.719 --> 02:07:01.350
create other and specify websites and this other ID and this way you will have

02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360
this other ID and this way you will have

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.629
this other ID and this way you will have two checkouts to check out workflows and

02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639
two checkouts to check out workflows and

02:07:04.639 --> 02:07:06.950
two checkouts to check out workflows and each of them will be available only for

02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960
each of them will be available only for

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:11.350
each of them will be available only for one website.

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.910
Okay.

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:19.350
Uh best practices. So when you will be

02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360
Uh best practices. So when you will be

02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:23.109
Uh best practices. So when you will be creating uh actions and using those

02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119
creating uh actions and using those

02:07:23.119 --> 02:07:26.229
creating uh actions and using those actions, you may at some point see that

02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239
actions, you may at some point see that

02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:28.390
actions, you may at some point see that your action block it's really really

02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400
your action block it's really really

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:31.669
your action block it's really really big. So here it's actually very short

02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679
big. So here it's actually very short

02:07:31.679 --> 02:07:34.470
big. So here it's actually very short because we have only three actions. But

02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480
because we have only three actions. But

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.790
because we have only three actions. But you may have a situation that this is

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800
you may have a situation that this is

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.510
you may have a situation that this is becoming very very very long. Uh so

02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520
becoming very very very long. Uh so

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.149
becoming very very very long. Uh so sometimes it's better to create your

02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159
sometimes it's better to create your

02:07:42.159 --> 02:07:47.589
sometimes it's better to create your custom action instead of using a lot of

02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599
custom action instead of using a lot of

02:07:47.599 --> 02:07:51.589
custom action instead of using a lot of those. Okay. So creating custom action

02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599
those. Okay. So creating custom action

02:07:51.599 --> 02:07:53.430
those. Okay. So creating custom action do not forget that you can do it because

02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440
do not forget that you can do it because

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:59.430
do not forget that you can do it because it's it's good choice in many cases.

02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440
it's it's good choice in many cases.

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:02.790
it's it's good choice in many cases. Also sometimes it may be faster instead

02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800
Also sometimes it may be faster instead

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.830
Also sometimes it may be faster instead of a listener event listener. And

02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840
of a listener event listener. And

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:07.510
of a listener event listener. And remember that this process can be time

02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520
remember that this process can be time

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.750
remember that this process can be time shift and you can enable disabled from

02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760
shift and you can enable disabled from

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:13.030
shift and you can enable disabled from the UI. So it has a lot of benefits

02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040
the UI. So it has a lot of benefits

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.189
the UI. So it has a lot of benefits uh comparing to normal uh standard

02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199
uh comparing to normal uh standard

02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:19.430
uh comparing to normal uh standard entity event listener. Uh if you want to

02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440
entity event listener. Uh if you want to

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:22.870
entity event listener. Uh if you want to uh modify the workflow existing one for

02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880
uh modify the workflow existing one for

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.430
uh modify the workflow existing one for example you will at some point for sure

02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440
example you will at some point for sure

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:28.149
example you will at some point for sure uh modify checkout workflow uh start

02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159
uh modify checkout workflow uh start

02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:31.589
uh modify checkout workflow uh start from creating a copy and enabling the

02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599
from creating a copy and enabling the

02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:34.229
from creating a copy and enabling the copy and then putting customizations on

02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239
copy and then putting customizations on

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:36.790
copy and then putting customizations on top of this copy because uh this way you

02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800
top of this copy because uh this way you

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:39.990
top of this copy because uh this way you will not face BC breaks uh and when you

02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000
will not face BC breaks uh and when you

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.229
will not face BC breaks uh and when you will be doing upgrades which will not be

02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239
will be doing upgrades which will not be

02:08:42.239 --> 02:08:44.229
will be doing upgrades which will not be for you anytime soon but believe me when

02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239
for you anytime soon but believe me when

02:08:44.239 --> 02:08:46.629
for you anytime soon but believe me when we do upgrades

02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639
we do upgrades

02:08:46.639 --> 02:08:50.390
we do upgrades um

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:52.709
upgrading checkout is actually the

02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719
upgrading checkout is actually the

02:08:52.719 --> 02:08:56.470
upgrading checkout is actually the biggest um problem.

02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480
biggest um problem.

02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.910
biggest um problem. Uh so we always uh do a copy because

02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920
Uh so we always uh do a copy because

02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:02.390
Uh so we always uh do a copy because then we have our working checkout and if

02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400
then we have our working checkout and if

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.790
then we have our working checkout and if we really want to update this checkout

02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800
we really want to update this checkout

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.510
we really want to update this checkout with some new functionalities that uh

02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520
with some new functionalities that uh

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:11.830
with some new functionalities that uh were added in the newer version then we

02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840
were added in the newer version then we

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:14.550
were added in the newer version then we uh plan some time for it and do it. But

02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560
uh plan some time for it and do it. But

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.189
uh plan some time for it and do it. But if we don't, we will still have our

02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199
if we don't, we will still have our

02:09:17.199 --> 02:09:19.189
if we don't, we will still have our checkout because we created a duplicate

02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199
checkout because we created a duplicate

02:09:19.199 --> 02:09:21.350
checkout because we created a duplicate and it still will be working. And the

02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360
and it still will be working. And the

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:24.069
and it still will be working. And the checkout beside the catalog list, it's

02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079
checkout beside the catalog list, it's

02:09:24.079 --> 02:09:27.830
checkout beside the catalog list, it's the most important part of our course.

02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840
the most important part of our course.

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.229
the most important part of our course. And the if you want to double check if

02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239
And the if you want to double check if

02:09:30.239 --> 02:09:34.310
And the if you want to double check if something was um applied correctly, you

02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320
something was um applied correctly, you

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.470
something was um applied correctly, you have this command to the buck workflows.

02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480
have this command to the buck workflows.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:38.709
have this command to the buck workflows. Also from me do not forget every time

02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719
Also from me do not forget every time

02:09:38.719 --> 02:09:41.990
Also from me do not forget every time you modify the workflow uh do not forget

02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000
you modify the workflow uh do not forget

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.510
you modify the workflow uh do not forget to execute this oral workflow definition

02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520
to execute this oral workflow definition

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:47.830
to execute this oral workflow definition load wherever whenever you do any change

02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840
load wherever whenever you do any change

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:49.750
load wherever whenever you do any change to your workflow definition in the AM

02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760
to your workflow definition in the AM

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.229
to your workflow definition in the AM file remember to execute this command.

02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239
file remember to execute this command.

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:56.470
file remember to execute this command. Okay,

02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480
Okay,

02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:04.310
Okay, any questions?

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:06.229
So, let's switch to practice. We'll

02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239
So, let's switch to practice. We'll

02:10:06.239 --> 02:10:09.430
So, let's switch to practice. We'll start today and finish tomorrow.

02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440
start today and finish tomorrow.

02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.669
start today and finish tomorrow. Uh, and in the practice, we want to

02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679
Uh, and in the practice, we want to

02:10:11.679 --> 02:10:15.910
Uh, and in the practice, we want to create actually really simple workflow.

02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920
create actually really simple workflow.

02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.830
create actually really simple workflow. It's not going to be on usernaming type

02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840
It's not going to be on usernaming type

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.669
It's not going to be on usernaming type entity.

02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679
entity.

02:10:19.679 --> 02:10:21.990
entity. It's going to be on the user entity.

02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000
It's going to be on the user entity.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.470
It's going to be on the user entity. Okay. So at the end

02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480
Okay. So at the end

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.709
Okay. So at the end um

02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719
um

02:10:26.719 --> 02:10:32.790
um if you go to user entity

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:37.270
uh you will have this workflow here.

02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280
uh you will have this workflow here.

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.189
uh you will have this workflow here. Okay. So we will create a workflow and

02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199
Okay. So we will create a workflow and

02:10:39.199 --> 02:10:41.750
Okay. So we will create a workflow and bind it to the user entity and this

02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760
bind it to the user entity and this

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:45.669
bind it to the user entity and this workflow during this workflow we will uh

02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679
workflow during this workflow we will uh

02:10:45.679 --> 02:10:49.270
workflow during this workflow we will uh want to fill in the name data. So in

02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280
want to fill in the name data. So in

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:51.669
want to fill in the name data. So in first step we will fill in name prefix,

02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679
first step we will fill in name prefix,

02:10:51.679 --> 02:10:53.350
first step we will fill in name prefix, first name, middle name, last name, name

02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360
first name, middle name, last name, name

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:55.750
first name, middle name, last name, name suffix and in second step which is

02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760
suffix and in second step which is

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.830
suffix and in second step which is actually uh optional uh we will uh

02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840
actually uh optional uh we will uh

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:03.669
actually uh optional uh we will uh select usernaming type.

02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679
select usernaming type.

02:11:03.679 --> 02:11:06.149
select usernaming type. Okay. So first step will look like this

02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159
Okay. So first step will look like this

02:11:06.159 --> 02:11:09.030
Okay. So first step will look like this at the end

02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040
at the end

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.430
at the end and second step

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:15.589
will look like this. And this is

02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599
will look like this. And this is

02:11:15.599 --> 02:11:18.310
will look like this. And this is actually optional part. So we'll see if

02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320
actually optional part. So we'll see if

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:21.109
actually optional part. So we'll see if if we'll do it. Uh normally it will just

02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119
if we'll do it. Uh normally it will just

02:11:21.119 --> 02:11:25.189
if we'll do it. Uh normally it will just lead to another step and do nothing.

02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199
lead to another step and do nothing.

02:11:25.199 --> 02:11:27.750
lead to another step and do nothing. Uh okay. So instead of trying to figure

02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760
Uh okay. So instead of trying to figure

02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.750
Uh okay. So instead of trying to figure out what's written here, let's see the

02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760
out what's written here, let's see the

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:33.350
out what's written here, let's see the diagram. It's easier. So I want you to

02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360
diagram. It's easier. So I want you to

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.990
diagram. It's easier. So I want you to create a workflow bind it to the user

02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000
create a workflow bind it to the user

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.750
create a workflow bind it to the user entity. Um and this workflow should have

02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760
entity. Um and this workflow should have

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:42.069
entity. Um and this workflow should have three steps. Name not is not

02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079
three steps. Name not is not

02:11:42.079 --> 02:11:44.470
three steps. Name not is not initialized. Then we'll have name part

02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480
initialized. Then we'll have name part

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.910
initialized. Then we'll have name part set and then naming type set. Then I

02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920
set and then naming type set. Then I

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.350
set and then naming type set. Then I want you also to create three

02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360
want you also to create three

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.870
want you also to create three transitions. First transition where we

02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880
transitions. First transition where we

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.350
transitions. First transition where we will set name parts and this transition

02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360
will set name parts and this transition

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.830
will set name parts and this transition from first step to the other. Then

02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840
from first step to the other. Then

02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.910
from first step to the other. Then second step to set naming type

02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920
second step to set naming type

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.510
second step to set naming type and then uh reinitialize name transition

02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520
and then uh reinitialize name transition

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:07.350
and then uh reinitialize name transition and this transition will be available

02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360
and this transition will be available

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:10.470
and this transition will be available for from step second and third and it

02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480
for from step second and third and it

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.390
for from step second and third and it will lead back to the first step and

02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400
will lead back to the first step and

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:16.229
will lead back to the first step and actually do nothing.

02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:20.390
uh after you create this uh so let's

02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400
uh after you create this uh so let's

02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.550
uh after you create this uh so let's start first from creating steps and

02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560
start first from creating steps and

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:24.149
start first from creating steps and transitions

02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159
transitions

02:12:24.159 --> 02:12:25.910
transitions and do not do anything inside

02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920
and do not do anything inside

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:27.430
and do not do anything inside transitions.

02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440
transitions.

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.189
transitions. Then

02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199
Then

02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:32.470
Then inside the first transition I want you

02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480
inside the first transition I want you

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.709
inside the first transition I want you to show in the form popup those five

02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719
to show in the form popup those five

02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:37.669
to show in the form popup those five name part elements and make sure that

02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679
name part elements and make sure that

02:12:37.679 --> 02:12:39.830
name part elements and make sure that first name and last name are required.

02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840
first name and last name are required.

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:42.709
first name and last name are required. So exactly what let me go to

02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719
So exactly what let me go to

02:12:42.719 --> 02:12:45.270
So exactly what let me go to reinitialize name. So this transition

02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280
reinitialize name. So this transition

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:48.310
reinitialize name. So this transition first transition will show a form popup

02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320
first transition will show a form popup

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.950
first transition will show a form popup with five elements and two of them will

02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960
with five elements and two of them will

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:53.990
with five elements and two of them will be required.

02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000
be required.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.270
be required. Uh hint use form options for that you

02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280
Uh hint use form options for that you

02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:00.790
Uh hint use form options for that you have also plenty examples uh on the

02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800
have also plenty examples uh on the

02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:03.669
have also plenty examples uh on the slides from the theory. Uh and that's

02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679
slides from the theory. Uh and that's

02:13:03.679 --> 02:13:06.709
slides from the theory. Uh and that's basically it. If you have enough time uh

02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719
basically it. If you have enough time uh

02:13:06.719 --> 02:13:11.430
basically it. If you have enough time uh then also for the second transition

02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440
then also for the second transition

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.790
then also for the second transition um render there just one drop list

02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800
um render there just one drop list

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:17.910
um render there just one drop list filled in with the naming type.

02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920
filled in with the naming type.

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:20.709
filled in with the naming type. And a hint for this is that you will

02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719
And a hint for this is that you will

02:13:20.719 --> 02:13:23.350
And a hint for this is that you will need to use a custom form type and

02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360
need to use a custom form type and

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:25.750
need to use a custom form type and Symfony will help you with that because

02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760
Symfony will help you with that because

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:28.870
Symfony will help you with that because Symfony has this entity type that you

02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880
Symfony has this entity type that you

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:31.750
Symfony has this entity type that you can use and to this entity type the only

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760
can use and to this entity type the only

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:34.390
can use and to this entity type the only thing you need to pass is the class. So

02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400
thing you need to pass is the class. So

02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:36.950
thing you need to pass is the class. So this entity type needs to know uh what

02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960
this entity type needs to know uh what

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.629
this entity type needs to know uh what class to show and uh by which field. So

02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639
class to show and uh by which field. So

02:13:42.639 --> 02:13:49.589
class to show and uh by which field. So at the end you will have a

02:13:49.599 --> 02:13:52.069
one element this is entity choice and

02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079
one element this is entity choice and

02:13:52.079 --> 02:13:54.390
one element this is entity choice and we're listing usernaming types and we're

02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400
we're listing usernaming types and we're

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:58.390
we're listing usernaming types and we're showing them by titles

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.109
and I can submit it

02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119
and I can submit it

02:14:01.119 --> 02:14:04.470
and I can submit it and it was but this is an optional part

02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480
and it was but this is an optional part

02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.950
and it was but this is an optional part in let's see if we'll have time for it.

02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960
in let's see if we'll have time for it.

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.589
in let's see if we'll have time for it. Uh okay we have uh like 25 more minutes.

02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599

02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480
Uh yeah just start from creating a

02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:20.310
Uh yeah just start from creating a workflow. It can be empty one just you

02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320
workflow. It can be empty one just you

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.149
workflow. It can be empty one just you know clicking the buttons doing nothing

02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159
know clicking the buttons doing nothing

02:14:22.159 --> 02:14:25.270
know clicking the buttons doing nothing nothing just going from one step to the

02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280
nothing just going from one step to the

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:28.470
nothing just going from one step to the other and then add some additional

other and then add some additional

02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:34.629
other and then add some additional elements to your transitions.
