00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.030
My plan is my 400 PM then I'll have an

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.040
My plan is my 400 PM then I'll have an

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.630
My plan is my 400 PM then I'll have an hour for theory and we have we will have

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640
hour for theory and we have we will have

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.910
hour for theory and we have we will have another hour for practice for yet again

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920
another hour for practice for yet again

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.629
another hour for practice for yet again next topic. Okay.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639
next topic. Okay.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.230
next topic. Okay. So that's the plan for today in case uh

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240
So that's the plan for today in case uh

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.070
So that's the plan for today in case uh you

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080
you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.870
you want to plan your evening.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
want to plan your evening.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.230
want to plan your evening. Okay. So since you're here, I will show

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
Okay. So since you're here, I will show

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.750
Okay. So since you're here, I will show solution for topic number four and then

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760
solution for topic number four and then

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.830
solution for topic number four and then explain a practice for topic number

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840
explain a practice for topic number

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.389
explain a practice for topic number five.

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399
five.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.229
five. And basically, yep, you will decide what

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239
And basically, yep, you will decide what

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.709
And basically, yep, you will decide what to do.

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719
to do.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.990
to do. Okay.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.350
Okay. [Music]

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.709
Okay. Um

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.229
you see my screen right? You see my

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
you see my screen right? You see my

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830
you see my screen right? You see my screen. Uh okay. So for the practice

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
screen. Uh okay. So for the practice

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.670
screen. Uh okay. So for the practice number four for the topic about entities

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680
number four for the topic about entities

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.070
number four for the topic about entities and migration. First of all we wanted to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080
and migration. First of all we wanted to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.750
and migration. First of all we wanted to create a new entity a custom one called

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
create a new entity a custom one called

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.990
create a new entity a custom one called usernaming type. So for this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000
usernaming type. So for this

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.109
usernaming type. So for this I need to switch the

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119
I need to switch the

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.109
I need to switch the environment. Okay,

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119
environment. Okay,

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.070
environment. Okay, for this uh inside our bundle

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
for this uh inside our bundle

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.469
for this uh inside our bundle uh we created entity directory and this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
uh we created entity directory and this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390
uh we created entity directory and this usernaming type entity that's it's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
usernaming type entity that's it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.910
usernaming type entity that's it's supposed to be there and this entity

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920
supposed to be there and this entity

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.030
supposed to be there and this entity yeah that basically is a PHP class then

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040
yeah that basically is a PHP class then

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.710
yeah that basically is a PHP class then it needs to be configurable at

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720
it needs to be configurable at

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.469
it needs to be configurable at extendable. So to make entity

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
extendable. So to make entity

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.270
extendable. So to make entity configurable to do is put this add

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
configurable to do is put this add

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.830
configurable to do is put this add config section here. Uh actually it can

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
config section here. Uh actually it can

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.389
config section here. Uh actually it can be empty like this one. Maybe it will be

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
be empty like this one. Maybe it will be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.950
be empty like this one. Maybe it will be even easier. Uh so this just means that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960
even easier. Uh so this just means that

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.230
even easier. Uh so this just means that the configurable functionality will be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240
the configurable functionality will be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.550
the configurable functionality will be a particular entity

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
a particular entity

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.670
a particular entity and that's it. Uh to make it extendable

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
and that's it. Uh to make it extendable

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.749
and that's it. Uh to make it extendable so to be able to for example create

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759
so to be able to for example create

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.590
so to be able to for example create relation between this entity and some

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
relation between this entity and some

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.910
relation between this entity and some core entity both entities needs to be

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
core entity both entities needs to be

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.749
core entity both entities needs to be extendable. That's why we want this one

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759
extendable. That's why we want this one

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.030
extendable. That's why we want this one also uh to be extendable. And to do

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
also uh to be extendable. And to do

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.910
also uh to be extendable. And to do this, we need to implement extend entity

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920
this, we need to implement extend entity

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.990
this, we need to implement extend entity interface. A million, can I ask you to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
interface. A million, can I ask you to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.430
interface. A million, can I ask you to mute yourself because I hear some

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
mute yourself because I hear some

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.510
mute yourself because I hear some background noises.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520
background noises.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.630
background noises. &gt;&gt; Uh sorry.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640
&gt;&gt; Uh sorry.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.470
&gt;&gt; Uh sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Uh so we need to implement this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
Uh so we need to implement this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.270
Uh so we need to implement this interface and uh it will force us to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
interface and uh it will force us to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.949
interface and uh it will force us to implement few methods but we don't need

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959
implement few methods but we don't need

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.550
implement few methods but we don't need to do it because we also need to um for

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
to do it because we also need to um for

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.190
to do it because we also need to um for our entity to use extend entity trait

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
our entity to use extend entity trait

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830
our entity to use extend entity trait inside this trait has all the methods uh

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
inside this trait has all the methods uh

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.710
inside this trait has all the methods uh that will allow us to have get fun

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
that will allow us to have get fun

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.509
that will allow us to have get fun getters and setters for all the custom

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519
getters and setters for all the custom

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.550
getters and setters for all the custom uh fields and relations.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560
uh fields and relations.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.030
uh fields and relations. Uh and then uh

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
Uh and then uh

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.430
Uh and then uh this entity needs to have three fields.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
this entity needs to have three fields.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.830
this entity needs to have three fields. ID which will be our primary key. So it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
ID which will be our primary key. So it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.150
ID which will be our primary key. So it needs to be auto incremented integer.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160
needs to be auto incremented integer.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.550
needs to be auto incremented integer. Then we have a title that is string max

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
Then we have a title that is string max

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.589
Then we have a title that is string max length 64 and format also string in this

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599
length 64 and format also string in this

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:14.949
length 64 and format also string in this case max length 255.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.750
Uh hi I'm just explaining solution for

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
Uh hi I'm just explaining solution for

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.830
Uh hi I'm just explaining solution for previous uh practice from yesterday.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
previous uh practice from yesterday.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.750
previous uh practice from yesterday. Uh okay so to do that inside our entity

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
Uh okay so to do that inside our entity

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.589
Uh okay so to do that inside our entity we are adding those fields ID title and

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599
we are adding those fields ID title and

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.990
we are adding those fields ID title and format. Uh and then we also generated

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000
format. Uh and then we also generated

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.910
format. Uh and then we also generated because you can generate from PHP storm

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
because you can generate from PHP storm

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.550
because you can generate from PHP storm or create on your own depending what you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560
or create on your own depending what you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.190
or create on your own depending what you prefer. uh getters and setters. For ID

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200
prefer. uh getters and setters. For ID

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.589
prefer. uh getters and setters. For ID only getter because this is supposed to

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599
only getter because this is supposed to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.509
only getter because this is supposed to be automatically incremented value. So

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519
be automatically incremented value. So

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.190
be automatically incremented value. So no setter here. But for title and for

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200
no setter here. But for title and for

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.390
no setter here. But for title and for format we have both getters and setters.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
format we have both getters and setters.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.949
format we have both getters and setters. Uh and then we need to add mappings uh

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
Uh and then we need to add mappings uh

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.670
Uh and then we need to add mappings uh doctrine mappings.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
doctrine mappings.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.990
doctrine mappings. So for doctrine mappics we use

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000
So for doctrine mappics we use

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.830
So for doctrine mappics we use this import

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.350
and uh in here we're mapping we're

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360
and uh in here we're mapping we're

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.509
and uh in here we're mapping we're basically saying doctrine that this is

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519
basically saying doctrine that this is

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.910
basically saying doctrine that this is going to be an entity and it's going to

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920
going to be an entity and it's going to

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.110
going to be an entity and it's going to sit in this particular table and for

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
sit in this particular table and for

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.189
sit in this particular table and for each field on this entity we also need

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199
each field on this entity we also need

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.350
each field on this entity we also need to add mappings. So here this is id uh

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360
to add mappings. So here this is id uh

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.990
to add mappings. So here this is id uh it's an integer and it will be

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000
it's an integer and it will be

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.390
it's an integer and it will be automatically generated the value for

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400
automatically generated the value for

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.189
automatically generated the value for the string uh columns uh the mapping

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199
the string uh columns uh the mapping

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.749
the string uh columns uh the mapping it's easier only the fact that it's

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
it's easier only the fact that it's

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.469
it's easier only the fact that it's going to be a column of type string some

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479
going to be a column of type string some

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.189
going to be a column of type string some length and we actually also added here

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199
length and we actually also added here

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.270
length and we actually also added here uh nullable false so we will need to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280
uh nullable false so we will need to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.550
uh nullable false so we will need to fill in the values for those fields and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560
fill in the values for those fields and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.629
fill in the values for those fields and that's all regarding creating the entity

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639
that's all regarding creating the entity

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.590
that's all regarding creating the entity itself so short entity key

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600
itself so short entity key

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.950
itself so short entity key table name three uh fields getter

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960
table name three uh fields getter

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.909
table name three uh fields getter setters and that's it. Uh then we want

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919
setters and that's it. Uh then we want

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.909
setters and that's it. Uh then we want this entity to be inside the database.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919
this entity to be inside the database.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.310
this entity to be inside the database. So for this we need to create installer

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320
So for this we need to create installer

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.749
So for this we need to create installer and here also we have a hint of how to

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759
and here also we have a hint of how to

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.749
and here also we have a hint of how to create a table. Okay. So we will also

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759
create a table. Okay. So we will also

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.749
create a table. Okay. So we will also need to do similar thing to create some

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759
need to do similar thing to create some

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.469
need to do similar thing to create some table the one for our usernaming type.

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479
table the one for our usernaming type.

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.629
table the one for our usernaming type. Then add ID column, mark it as primary

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639
Then add ID column, mark it as primary

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.510
Then add ID column, mark it as primary key. And then add two string columns.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
key. And then add two string columns.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.990
key. And then add two string columns. Not label for us. It's title and format.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000
Not label for us. It's title and format.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.310
Not label for us. It's title and format. But basically this is exactly what we're

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320
But basically this is exactly what we're

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.350
But basically this is exactly what we're going to do.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360
going to do.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.590
going to do. Okay.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.909
Um okay. So for this we need to create

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919
Um okay. So for this we need to create

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.469
Um okay. So for this we need to create sorry guys we need to create uh

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479
sorry guys we need to create uh

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.469
sorry guys we need to create uh installer. Installer needs to be in

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479
installer. Installer needs to be in

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.870
installer. Installer needs to be in particular localization. So under

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880
particular localization. So under

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.350
particular localization. So under migration schema

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360
migration schema

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.990
migration schema we create installer

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000
we create installer

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.350
we create installer uh at first is I will

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.990
I will modify it. So you will have

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
I will modify it. So you will have

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.749
I will modify it. So you will have first part first and then I will

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759
first part first and then I will

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.430
first part first and then I will uh show you the second part. So first

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440
uh show you the second part. So first

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.110
uh show you the second part. So first we're going to have only the installer

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120
we're going to have only the installer

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.510
we're going to have only the installer uh and it needs to be inside migration

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520
uh and it needs to be inside migration

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.990
uh and it needs to be inside migration schema and then installer needs to

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000
schema and then installer needs to

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.510
schema and then installer needs to implement installation from our

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
implement installation from our

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.749
implement installation from our migrations bundle

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759
migrations bundle

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.309
migrations bundle and it will force you to say that this

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319
and it will force you to say that this

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.990
and it will force you to say that this installer is up to date with migration

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000
installer is up to date with migration

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.150
installer is up to date with migration number zero. So with no migrations right

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160
number zero. So with no migrations right

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.469
number zero. So with no migrations right now we have only installer and inside

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479
now we have only installer and inside

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.550
now we have only installer and inside this installer you need to implement the

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560
this installer you need to implement the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.350
this installer you need to implement the app function which has schema object and

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360
app function which has schema object and

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.870
app function which has schema object and this is the object that we're working

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880
this is the object that we're working

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.670
this is the object that we're working on. uh and we basically need to create a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680
on. uh and we basically need to create a

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.309
on. uh and we basically need to create a table. This needs to be the same as you

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319
table. This needs to be the same as you

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.390
table. This needs to be the same as you have in your mapping on your entity.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400
have in your mapping on your entity.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.469
have in your mapping on your entity. Okay. So here we defined that this

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479
Okay. So here we defined that this

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.629
Okay. So here we defined that this entity it's going to be this table. So

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639
entity it's going to be this table. So

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.510
entity it's going to be this table. So we need to create exactly this table and

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520
we need to create exactly this table and

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.510
we need to create exactly this table and right now we are creating this table

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
right now we are creating this table

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.550
right now we are creating this table adding ID column as auto increment

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560
adding ID column as auto increment

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.070
adding ID column as auto increment adding title column at string length 64

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080
adding title column at string length 64

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.790
adding title column at string length 64 or format string length to 55 and

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
or format string length to 55 and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.390
or format string length to 55 and setting ID as primary key. after this

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400
setting ID as primary key. after this

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.189
setting ID as primary key. after this and uh we need to execute the migration

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199
and uh we need to execute the migration

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.390
and uh we need to execute the migration uh load command and when this command

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400
uh load command and when this command

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.189
uh load command and when this command succeeds

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.870
uh guys who joined uh I just I'm just

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880
uh guys who joined uh I just I'm just

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.629
uh guys who joined uh I just I'm just showing solution for the previous

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639
showing solution for the previous

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.430
showing solution for the previous practice for everyone to be on the same

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440
practice for everyone to be on the same

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.670
practice for everyone to be on the same page.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680
page.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.469
page. Uh so after creating this part we need

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479
Uh so after creating this part we need

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.230
Uh so after creating this part we need to execute the command and when the

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240
to execute the command and when the

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.150
to execute the command and when the command finish we should have in a

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160
command finish we should have in a

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.909
command finish we should have in a database.

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919
database.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.790
database. Uh okay and now I need to actually

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800
Uh okay and now I need to actually

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.309
Uh okay and now I need to actually open other project which finally built.

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319
open other project which finally built.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.390
open other project which finally built. Okay.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.990
in the background I was just doing

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000
in the background I was just doing

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.110
in the background I was just doing platform update for

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120
platform update for

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.510
platform update for uh

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520
uh

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.670
uh for this particular step to have it

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680
for this particular step to have it

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.070
for this particular step to have it here. Okay.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080
here. Okay.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.469
here. Okay. So after this

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:05.510
one

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.510
&gt;&gt; okay

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520
&gt;&gt; okay

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.070
&gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; just quick question the folder name uh

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080
&gt;&gt; just quick question the folder name uh

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.189
&gt;&gt; just quick question the folder name uh and the version uh is needs to be the

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199
and the version uh is needs to be the

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.749
and the version uh is needs to be the same or it is okay

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759
same or it is okay

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.230
same or it is okay to have you know

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240
to have you know

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.110
to have you know the installer schema file. Uh so

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120
the installer schema file. Uh so

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.830
the installer schema file. Uh so installer needs to sit inside migration

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840
installer needs to sit inside migration

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.309
installer needs to sit inside migration schema exactly this directory because

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319
schema exactly this directory because

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.550
schema exactly this directory because our core bundle that is responsible for

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560
our core bundle that is responsible for

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.110
our core bundle that is responsible for loading my installers and migrations

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120
loading my installers and migrations

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.029
loading my installers and migrations they are just implemented to search for

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039
they are just implemented to search for

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.909
they are just implemented to search for those files in particular locations.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919
those files in particular locations.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.790
those files in particular locations. &gt;&gt; Yeah agree and in the file you uh

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah agree and in the file you uh

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.829
&gt;&gt; Yeah agree and in the file you uh mentioned the version is written v1.0

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839
mentioned the version is written v1.0

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.710
mentioned the version is written v1.0 right and uh under the schema there is a

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720
right and uh under the schema there is a

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.269
right and uh under the schema there is a directory called v1_1. So is it uh needs

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279
directory called v1_1. So is it uh needs

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.829
directory called v1_1. So is it uh needs to be the same or it's not?

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839
to be the same or it's not?

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.829
to be the same or it's not? &gt;&gt; Okay, you skipped yesterday and I

00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839
&gt;&gt; Okay, you skipped yesterday and I

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, you skipped yesterday and I actually explained all that.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920
actually explained all that.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.030
actually explained all that. &gt;&gt; Oh, no wor. So yeah, just to be short,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, no wor. So yeah, just to be short,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.389
&gt;&gt; Oh, no wor. So yeah, just to be short, it's the here we have installer and here

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399
it's the here we have installer and here

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:05.030
it's the here we have installer and here we saying that our code in the installer

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040
we saying that our code in the installer

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.750
we saying that our code in the installer is up to date with some migration. In a

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
is up to date with some migration. In a

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.590
is up to date with some migration. In a moment, the next task in the practice

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600
moment, the next task in the practice

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.150
moment, the next task in the practice will be to create uh some modification

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160
will be to create uh some modification

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.750
will be to create uh some modification to database with migration. So uh this

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760
to database with migration. So uh this

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.670
to database with migration. So uh this flow should be more clear for you

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680
flow should be more clear for you

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.430
flow should be more clear for you because I'm actually showing this step

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440
because I'm actually showing this step

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.070
because I'm actually showing this step by step. So in a second I will show you

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080
by step. So in a second I will show you

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.470
by step. So in a second I will show you why and when we create that. If after

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480
why and when we create that. If after

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.910
why and when we create that. If after that you'll still still have some

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920
that you'll still still have some

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.509
that you'll still still have some questions then let me know. I will try

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519
questions then let me know. I will try

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:31.269
questions then let me know. I will try to uh explain once more. Okay.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279
to uh explain once more. Okay.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.670
to uh explain once more. Okay. &gt;&gt; So just now let me finish because I'm

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680
&gt;&gt; So just now let me finish because I'm

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.190
&gt;&gt; So just now let me finish because I'm actually showing you the whole flow how

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200
actually showing you the whole flow how

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.910
actually showing you the whole flow how how it it's created. Okay. So migrations

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920
how it it's created. Okay. So migrations

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.790
how it it's created. Okay. So migrations needs to sit here. At first we'll when

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800
needs to sit here. At first we'll when

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.430
needs to sit here. At first we'll when you build the bundle from scratch you

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440
you build the bundle from scratch you

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.949
you build the bundle from scratch you don't need any migrations. You just

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959
don't need any migrations. You just

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.030
don't need any migrations. You just create installer because installer is

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040
create installer because installer is

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.030
create installer because installer is the file that should consist um the

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040
the file that should consist um the

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.070
the file that should consist um the whole schema for your bundle. Okay. So

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080
whole schema for your bundle. Okay. So

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.670
whole schema for your bundle. Okay. So all the tables everything that you need

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680
all the tables everything that you need

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.870
all the tables everything that you need to have in a database uh but in scope of

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880
to have in a database uh but in scope of

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.110
to have in a database uh but in scope of your bundle. Okay. So first we're just

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120
your bundle. Okay. So first we're just

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.509
your bundle. Okay. So first we're just creating a installer and this means that

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519
creating a installer and this means that

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:03.509
creating a installer and this means that migration version is zero zero. So

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519
migration version is zero zero. So

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.110
migration version is zero zero. So basically we don't have any migration

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120
basically we don't have any migration

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.110
basically we don't have any migration yet. Imagine that this directory is not

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120
yet. Imagine that this directory is not

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.110
yet. Imagine that this directory is not here yet. Um yeah.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120
here yet. Um yeah.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.590
here yet. Um yeah. Uh so after this uh we should have in

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600
Uh so after this uh we should have in

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.790
Uh so after this uh we should have in our database

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800
our database

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:30.389
our database tableing

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.030
usernaming table with all the fields

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040
usernaming table with all the fields

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.829
usernaming table with all the fields inside. Okay. add the title title format

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839
inside. Okay. add the title title format

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:38.230
inside. Okay. add the title title format and we also do have a serialized uh

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240
and we also do have a serialized uh

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.990
and we also do have a serialized uh field this is connected to the fact that

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000
field this is connected to the fact that

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.269
field this is connected to the fact that our entity it's extendable and when

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279
our entity it's extendable and when

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.430
our entity it's extendable and when entity is extendable you can later on

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440
entity is extendable you can later on

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.150
entity is extendable you can later on add fields to it some of the fields can

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160
add fields to it some of the fields can

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.030
add fields to it some of the fields can be like a column so we create the

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040
be like a column so we create the

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.110
be like a column so we create the separate column but we can also create a

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120
separate column but we can also create a

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.190
separate column but we can also create a field as a serializable type so it will

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200
field as a serializable type so it will

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.069
field as a serializable type so it will not have separate column and that's why

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079
not have separate column and that's why

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.150
not have separate column and that's why don't worry that you have it here that's

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160
don't worry that you have it here that's

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.710
don't worry that you have it here that's good actually extendable entities should

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720
good actually extendable entities should

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.389
good actually extendable entities should have this additional columns

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399
have this additional columns

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.350
have this additional columns in a database. So after doing this first

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360
in a database. So after doing this first

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.910
in a database. So after doing this first part, we're just going to have this um

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920
part, we're just going to have this um

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.150
part, we're just going to have this um table here created with the installer

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160
table here created with the installer

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.630
table here created with the installer and that's it. Uh then um in real life

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640
and that's it. Uh then um in real life

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.870
and that's it. Uh then um in real life you would add everything to installer

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880
you would add everything to installer

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.509
you would add everything to installer because that's a project start but in

00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519
because that's a project start but in

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.790
because that's a project start but in this exercise I wanted you to uh

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800
this exercise I wanted you to uh

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.430
this exercise I wanted you to uh exercise how to create migrations. So we

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440
exercise how to create migrations. So we

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.350
exercise how to create migrations. So we need to kind of imagine that between the

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360
need to kind of imagine that between the

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.990
need to kind of imagine that between the second point to add an installer and

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000
second point to add an installer and

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.069
second point to add an installer and this to add some relation like three

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079
this to add some relation like three

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:36.230
this to add some relation like three months happened in real life for example

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240
months happened in real life for example

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.230
months happened in real life for example right and then we come back to our

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240
right and then we come back to our

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.190
right and then we come back to our project our client come back to us and

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200
project our client come back to us and

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.030
project our client come back to us and we need to do some functionality which

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040
we need to do some functionality which

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.030
we need to do some functionality which which requires changing the database

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040
which requires changing the database

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.230
which requires changing the database structure again so for this uh we create

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240
structure again so for this uh we create

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.310
structure again so for this uh we create migration so migration will consist only

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320
migration so migration will consist only

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.150
migration so migration will consist only of those small adjustments to our

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160
of those small adjustments to our

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.630
of those small adjustments to our database schema

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:54.640
database schema

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.990
database schema um and we'll create our first migration

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000
um and we'll create our first migration

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.509
um and we'll create our first migration u addit there. So we need to create many

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519
u addit there. So we need to create many

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:04.550
u addit there. So we need to create many to one relation from user to user naming

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560
to one relation from user to user naming

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.030
to one relation from user to user naming type entity. So owning site will be user

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040
type entity. So owning site will be user

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.310
type entity. So owning site will be user entity. This this is our core entity and

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320
entity. This this is our core entity and

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.069
entity. This this is our core entity and the usernaming type the one that we just

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079
the usernaming type the one that we just

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.269
the usernaming type the one that we just created. Uh so for for this we use uh

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279
created. Uh so for for this we use uh

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:20.470
created. Uh so for for this we use uh extendable um functionality from Oro and

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480
extendable um functionality from Oro and

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.069
extendable um functionality from Oro and uh to create relation between your

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079
uh to create relation between your

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:24.550
uh to create relation between your entity and some core entity. All you

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560
entity and some core entity. All you

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.629
entity and some core entity. All you need to do is uh

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.910
use extend extension service. This is a

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920
use extend extension service. This is a

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.310
use extend extension service. This is a ser helper service. You need to inject

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320
ser helper service. You need to inject

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.190
ser helper service. You need to inject it in your migration and just basically

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200
it in your migration and just basically

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.030
it in your migration and just basically the service consists a lot of methods.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040
the service consists a lot of methods.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.870
the service consists a lot of methods. One of them is to create many to one

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880
One of them is to create many to one

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.870
One of them is to create many to one relation. And this is exactly what we're

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880
relation. And this is exactly what we're

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.710
relation. And this is exactly what we're going to do. Um so at this point I'm

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720
going to do. Um so at this point I'm

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.110
going to do. Um so at this point I'm going to create the first migration. So

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120
going to create the first migration. So

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.470
going to create the first migration. So directory v1_1

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480
directory v1_1

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.190
directory v1_1 and inside my migration file. The name

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200
and inside my migration file. The name

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.150
and inside my migration file. The name of the file here it's up to you. It

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160
of the file here it's up to you. It

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.829
of the file here it's up to you. It needs to implement migration from our

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839
needs to implement migration from our

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:04.710
needs to implement migration from our migration bundle. And then because we

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720
migration bundle. And then because we

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.870
migration bundle. And then because we want to use extended extension as helper

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880
want to use extended extension as helper

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.949
want to use extended extension as helper service to create relation between our

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959
service to create relation between our

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:11.829
service to create relation between our entity and core entity uh we need to

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839
entity and core entity uh we need to

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.470
entity and core entity uh we need to inject it. How? Basically we create a

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480
inject it. How? Basically we create a

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.230
inject it. How? Basically we create a field and specify setter core bundles

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240
field and specify setter core bundles

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.470
field and specify setter core bundles are responsible for putting here

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480
are responsible for putting here

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.430
are responsible for putting here appropriate ser service for you and

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440
appropriate ser service for you and

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.110
appropriate ser service for you and implement extent extension aware

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120
implement extent extension aware

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.110
implement extent extension aware interface. Basically this interface will

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120
interface. Basically this interface will

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.269
interface. Basically this interface will force you to have the setter there.

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279
force you to have the setter there.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.949
force you to have the setter there. Okay.

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959
Okay.

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.590
Okay. Uh and then uh here migration looks

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600
Uh and then uh here migration looks

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.310
Uh and then uh here migration looks exactly the same as uh installer. They

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320
exactly the same as uh installer. They

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.110
exactly the same as uh installer. They both has this up method. They both have

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120
both has this up method. They both have

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.750
both has this up method. They both have here the schema and queries. So you can

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760
here the schema and queries. So you can

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.829
here the schema and queries. So you can create post queries. So basically the

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839
create post queries. So basically the

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:47.990
create post queries. So basically the code inside it's pretty much the same.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000
code inside it's pretty much the same.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.710
code inside it's pretty much the same. And here we're using our helper to add

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720
And here we're using our helper to add

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.949
And here we're using our helper to add many to one relation. We are working on

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959
many to one relation. We are working on

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.670
many to one relation. We are working on the schema object owning site table. So

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680
the schema object owning site table. So

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.030
the schema object owning site table. So or user then association name uh we

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040
or user then association name uh we

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.110
or user then association name uh we called it name it naming type. So right

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120
called it name it naming type. So right

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.910
called it name it naming type. So right now our user entity will have naming

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920
now our user entity will have naming

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.550
now our user entity will have naming type field and we will have get naming

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560
type field and we will have get naming

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.509
type field and we will have get naming type set naming type methods um for this

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519
type set naming type methods um for this

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.230
type set naming type methods um for this user entity which is core entity target

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240
user entity which is core entity target

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.910
user entity which is core entity target table. So our usernaming type table and

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920
table. So our usernaming type table and

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.990
table. So our usernaming type table and then we with this you will have uh out

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000
then we with this you will have uh out

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.110
then we with this you will have uh out of the box generated many elements. So

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120
of the box generated many elements. So

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.030
of the box generated many elements. So we need to know how to display it in the

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040
we need to know how to display it in the

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.829
we need to know how to display it in the UI. And this is basically saying that

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839
UI. And this is basically saying that

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.910
UI. And this is basically saying that this particular relation will be

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920
this particular relation will be

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.189
this particular relation will be displayed by a title column. We have ID,

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199
displayed by a title column. We have ID,

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:37.670
displayed by a title column. We have ID, title, and format. So title seems like

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680
title, and format. So title seems like

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.189
title, and format. So title seems like the best idea. And with those options,

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199
the best idea. And with those options,

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:43.269
the best idea. And with those options, those are Ouro options. You're just

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279
those are Ouro options. You're just

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.350
those are Ouro options. You're just saying that you're using extend uh

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360
saying that you're using extend uh

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.990
saying that you're using extend uh functionality and owner custom means

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000
functionality and owner custom means

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.069
functionality and owner custom means that ARO in the background will

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079
that ARO in the background will

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:52.550
that ARO in the background will automatically generate a lot of uh

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560
automatically generate a lot of uh

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.030
automatically generate a lot of uh functionality for you. So you're only

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040
functionality for you. So you're only

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.949
functionality for you. So you're only creating relation in the background. You

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959
creating relation in the background. You

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:00.150
creating relation in the background. You will have it on user view page, edit,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160
will have it on user view page, edit,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.389
will have it on user view page, edit, data grid, etc. Okay, I will show you

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399
data grid, etc. Okay, I will show you

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.030
data grid, etc. Okay, I will show you that in a moment. So after we created

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040
that in a moment. So after we created

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.509
that in a moment. So after we created this migration, we need to go back to

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519
this migration, we need to go back to

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:12.710
this migration, we need to go back to our installer, update it with the

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.829
update it with the elements from our

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839
update it with the elements from our

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.910
update it with the elements from our migration. So always try to keep your

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920
migration. So always try to keep your

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.590
migration. So always try to keep your installer up to date with the latest

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600
installer up to date with the latest

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.350
installer up to date with the latest migration.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360
migration.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.110
migration. Okay. So we are adding

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120
Okay. So we are adding

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.949
Okay. So we are adding this relation here too. And then we are

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959
this relation here too. And then we are

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:31.350
this relation here too. And then we are saying okay now my installer is up to

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360
saying okay now my installer is up to

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.389
saying okay now my installer is up to date with migration version one. Right

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399
date with migration version one. Right

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.430
date with migration version one. Right now I can execute again uh the migration

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
now I can execute again uh the migration

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.910
now I can execute again uh the migration load command.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920
load command.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.470
load command. And this command in case

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.910
you will be looking for it. It's in here

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920
you will be looking for it. It's in here

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.310
you will be looking for it. It's in here this command. And after this command

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320
this command. And after this command

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.310
this command. And after this command finishes, I should have relation between

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320
finishes, I should have relation between

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.910
finishes, I should have relation between my entity and uh user entity.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920
my entity and uh user entity.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.949
my entity and uh user entity. And this will be visible in the or user

00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959
And this will be visible in the or user

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.629
And this will be visible in the or user table for example because the owning

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639
table for example because the owning

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:02.949
table for example because the owning site is or user. So only there we will

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959
site is or user. So only there we will

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:09.670
site is or user. So only there we will have relation relation field or user.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.269
Okay.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.790
I have this field that goes to my naming

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800
I have this field that goes to my naming

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.749
I have this field that goes to my naming type. Okay.

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759
type. Okay.

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:24.470
type. Okay. Um so we have relation and now in the

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480
Um so we have relation and now in the

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.189
Um so we have relation and now in the back office after this uh you should be

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199
back office after this uh you should be

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.110
back office after this uh you should be able to

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120
able to

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.189
able to um on the users grid you will have this

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199
um on the users grid you will have this

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:36.150
um on the users grid you will have this usernaming type

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160
usernaming type

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.590
usernaming type on the user view page

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600
on the user view page

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.790
on the user view page you will have it here on the view page

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800
you will have it here on the view page

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.590
you will have it here on the view page and on edit this will be under

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600
and on edit this will be under

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.590
and on edit this will be under additional section here you will have

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600
additional section here you will have

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.910
additional section here you will have option to select usernaming tag for our

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920
option to select usernaming tag for our

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.870
option to select usernaming tag for our entity. So this is all you have that you

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880
entity. So this is all you have that you

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.990
entity. So this is all you have that you get out of the box by using owner

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000
get out of the box by using owner

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.590
get out of the box by using owner custom. This is you telling or hey to

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600
custom. This is you telling or hey to

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.749
custom. This is you telling or hey to generate a lot of things for me.

00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759
generate a lot of things for me.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:06.470
generate a lot of things for me. Okay. And the last

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480
Okay. And the last

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.029
Okay. And the last point was to

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039
point was to

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:11.350
point was to um add data fixture. So basically right

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360
um add data fixture. So basically right

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.150
um add data fixture. So basically right now the table is still empty. I see here

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160
now the table is still empty. I see here

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.309
now the table is still empty. I see here some values because I already have this

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319
some values because I already have this

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.309
some values because I already have this fixture um loaded. Uh so this is

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319
fixture um loaded. Uh so this is

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.710
fixture um loaded. Uh so this is basically because the table was empty

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720
basically because the table was empty

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.630
basically because the table was empty and we want to fill it with some data

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640
and we want to fill it with some data

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.789
and we want to fill it with some data and we want to fill it with those data.

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799
and we want to fill it with those data.

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:29.430
and we want to fill it with those data. The title is official. Then this is

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440
The title is official. Then this is

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.710
The title is official. Then this is format title format title format. Okay.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720
format title format title format. Okay.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.990
format title format title format. Okay. So for data fixtures

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000
So for data fixtures

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.630
So for data fixtures they should be under migrations data or

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640
they should be under migrations data or

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.310
they should be under migrations data or um

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320
um

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.950
um directories are important in this case.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960
directories are important in this case.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.110
directories are important in this case. And then the name of the file is up to

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120
And then the name of the file is up to

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.590
And then the name of the file is up to you. And basically we're we have an

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600
you. And basically we're we have an

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.669
you. And basically we're we have an array here. And in for each loop we're

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679
array here. And in for each loop we're

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.630
array here. And in for each loop we're creating those usernaming types filling

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640
creating those usernaming types filling

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.870
creating those usernaming types filling them with some data persisting this uh

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880
them with some data persisting this uh

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.190
them with some data persisting this uh in the object manager and then flashing

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200
in the object manager and then flashing

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.590
in the object manager and then flashing the manager to push those changes to

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600
the manager to push those changes to

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.150
the manager to push those changes to database. To um for this data fixture to

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160
database. To um for this data fixture to

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.230
database. To um for this data fixture to be loaded we need to execute another

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240
be loaded we need to execute another

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.990
be loaded we need to execute another command and it's on this slide.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000
command and it's on this slide.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.870
command and it's on this slide. it's oral migration data load. So after

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880
it's oral migration data load. So after

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.590
it's oral migration data load. So after we execute this command, this fixture

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600
we execute this command, this fixture

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.830
we execute this command, this fixture will be loaded and we will have

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840
will be loaded and we will have

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.070
will be loaded and we will have our table

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080
our table

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.430
our table filled with those values.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440
filled with those values.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.400
filled with those values. Okay, and that was basically

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:32.410
Okay, and that was basically

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.950
Okay, and that was basically [Music]

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960
[Music]

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.510
[Music] all for the nonoptional parts. The

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520
all for the nonoptional parts. The

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.590
all for the nonoptional parts. The optional part was just basically playing

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600
optional part was just basically playing

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.390
optional part was just basically playing around with PHP. So we have this

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400
around with PHP. So we have this

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.310
around with PHP. So we have this decorator that is here displaying the

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320
decorator that is here displaying the

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.549
decorator that is here displaying the name of this user. Let me go to the view

00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559
name of this user. Let me go to the view

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:52.070
name of this user. Let me go to the view page and we created decorator and in

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080
page and we created decorator and in

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.390
page and we created decorator and in previous uh practice we are supposed to

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400
previous uh practice we are supposed to

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.350
previous uh practice we are supposed to just hardcode here first name, last

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360
just hardcode here first name, last

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.270
just hardcode here first name, last name, middle name. Okay. And right now

00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280
name, middle name. Okay. And right now

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.950
name, middle name. Okay. And right now we just want to play around with it a

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960
we just want to play around with it a

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.669
we just want to play around with it a little bit and

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679
little bit and

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.990
little bit and and make sure that instead of displaying

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000
and make sure that instead of displaying

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.230
and make sure that instead of displaying some hardcoded values, it's displaying

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240
some hardcoded values, it's displaying

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.870
some hardcoded values, it's displaying values based on selected usernaming

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880
values based on selected usernaming

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.630
values based on selected usernaming type. Okay, so we have usernaming types

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640
type. Okay, so we have usernaming types

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.110
type. Okay, so we have usernaming types here is my title. Here is format and

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120
here is my title. Here is format and

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.950
here is my title. Here is format and this format you need to um change those

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960
this format you need to um change those

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.430
this format you need to um change those keywords with real values. So under the

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440
keywords with real values. So under the

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.990
keywords with real values. So under the prefix part just put the real prefix of

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000
prefix part just put the real prefix of

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.270
prefix part just put the real prefix of your user entity. uh this part replaced

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280
your user entity. uh this part replaced

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.909
your user entity. uh this part replaced with the uh first name of your entity

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919
with the uh first name of your entity

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:36.070
with the uh first name of your entity and so on and so on. So yeah, so right

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080
and so on and so on. So yeah, so right

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.950
and so on and so on. So yeah, so right now our decorator

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.470
here

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480
here

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.190
here uh this get name method in which we

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200
uh this get name method in which we

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.510
uh this get name method in which we check that entity is user because we

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520
check that entity is user because we

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.990
check that entity is user because we want to do it only for the user entity.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000
want to do it only for the user entity.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.710
want to do it only for the user entity. Uh so previously we had here hardcoded

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720
Uh so previously we had here hardcoded

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.190
Uh so previously we had here hardcoded entity get first name entity get

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200
entity get first name entity get

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.270
entity get first name entity get something something. Uh so right now we

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280
something something. Uh so right now we

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.870
something something. Uh so right now we have created this relation

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880
have created this relation

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.190
have created this relation naming type. So we have get naming type

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200
naming type. So we have get naming type

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.470
naming type. So we have get naming type set naming type type and so on.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480
set naming type type and so on.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.470
set naming type type and so on. And we're fetching the naming type

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480
And we're fetching the naming type

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.150
And we're fetching the naming type selected for our user. If it is selected

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.160
selected for our user. If it is selected

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.470
selected for our user. If it is selected uh then we're fetching the format

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480
uh then we're fetching the format

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.630
uh then we're fetching the format and uh returning appropriate

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640
and uh returning appropriate

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.909
and uh returning appropriate real values just basically here we have

00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919
real values just basically here we have

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:32.149
real values just basically here we have strdtr PHP method to replace

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159
strdtr PHP method to replace

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:34.870
strdtr PHP method to replace occurrences of those elements with some

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880
occurrences of those elements with some

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.789
occurrences of those elements with some real values right so this is just

00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799
real values right so this is just

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.870
real values right so this is just basically clean

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880
basically clean

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.270
basically clean PHP

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280
PHP

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.149
PHP and here returning it we return it based

00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159
and here returning it we return it based

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:48.070
and here returning it we return it based on this selected format. Okay.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080
on this selected format. Okay.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.470
on this selected format. Okay. So that was the optional part.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.669
Uh okay. Now I'm going to switch to

00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679
Uh okay. Now I'm going to switch to

00:20:57.679 --> 00:21:00.149
Uh okay. Now I'm going to switch to explain you the next practice. Uh

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159
explain you the next practice. Uh

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.630
explain you the next practice. Uh because yesterday we also did a theory

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640
because yesterday we also did a theory

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.149
because yesterday we also did a theory for

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159
for

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.789
for topic number five which is data grid

00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799
topic number five which is data grid

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.990
topic number five which is data grid index page and menu. So right now we

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000
index page and menu. So right now we

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.590
index page and menu. So right now we have our entity and we want to create

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600
have our entity and we want to create

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.909
have our entity and we want to create index page for it. So we will need to

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919
index page for it. So we will need to

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:18.310
index page for it. So we will need to create a data grid for our usernaming

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320
create a data grid for our usernaming

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.510
create a data grid for our usernaming type entity. Uh then we will create

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520
type entity. Uh then we will create

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.230
type entity. Uh then we will create controller with appropriate action and

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240
controller with appropriate action and

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.190
controller with appropriate action and index html tweak file where we will just

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200
index html tweak file where we will just

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.110
index html tweak file where we will just uh display this data grid and at last we

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120
uh display this data grid and at last we

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.470
uh display this data grid and at last we will create menu element to be able to

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480
will create menu element to be able to

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.710
will create menu element to be able to reach the index page for our usernaming

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720
reach the index page for our usernaming

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.830
reach the index page for our usernaming types. So everything is also still goes

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840
types. So everything is also still goes

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.590
types. So everything is also still goes to the usernaming types.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.630
Okay. Closing everything.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.110
Okay. No optional parts here. Um yeah

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120
Okay. No optional parts here. Um yeah

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.149
Okay. No optional parts here. Um yeah only

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:01.830
this. So first we need to add index page

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840
this. So first we need to add index page

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.070
this. So first we need to add index page with naming type grids with columns

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080
with naming type grids with columns

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.270
with naming type grids with columns title and format. Uh oh actually

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280
title and format. Uh oh actually

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.909
title and format. Uh oh actually optional part is to implement the format

00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919
optional part is to implement the format

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:13.190
optional part is to implement the format uh by using a custom template there.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200
uh by using a custom template there.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.430
uh by using a custom template there. Um example of this optional part you can

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440
Um example of this optional part you can

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.029
Um example of this optional part you can find here on the slides about

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039
find here on the slides about

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:21.110
find here on the slides about configuration data grid here is a tweak

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120
configuration data grid here is a tweak

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.950
configuration data grid here is a tweak type column example. So

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960
type column example. So

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.190
type column example. So in case you get to the optional part

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200
in case you get to the optional part

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.909
in case you get to the optional part this is how you need to do it.

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:34.630
So first to create index page we need uh

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640
So first to create index page we need uh

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.750
So first to create index page we need uh to have controller because we don't have

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760
to have controller because we don't have

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.870
to have controller because we don't have this controller yet. Don't forget about

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880
this controller yet. Don't forget about

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.990
this controller yet. Don't forget about adding routing uh file. You have example

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000
adding routing uh file. You have example

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.950
adding routing uh file. You have example here. So basically routing file inside

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960
here. So basically routing file inside

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.669
here. So basically routing file inside resources config oro and then add your

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679
resources config oro and then add your

00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:51.590
resources config oro and then add your definition where you give path to the

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600
definition where you give path to the

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.470
definition where you give path to the controller. Specify that routes are

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480
controller. Specify that routes are

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.110
controller. Specify that routes are defined in as annotations and you can

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120
defined in as annotations and you can

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.310
defined in as annotations and you can give some prefix. So let's say user

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320
give some prefix. So let's say user

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.029
give some prefix. So let's say user naming types Albert user namings or

00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039
naming types Albert user namings or

00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:05.110
naming types Albert user namings or whatever you prefer just give it some

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120
whatever you prefer just give it some

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.149
whatever you prefer just give it some prefix. So later on we will for example

00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159
prefix. So later on we will for example

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:11.990
prefix. So later on we will for example have it like here. So not so I'm having

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000
have it like here. So not so I'm having

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.830
have it like here. So not so I'm having it not admin slash and this is my prefix

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840
it not admin slash and this is my prefix

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.230
it not admin slash and this is my prefix okay because index page it's just a

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240
okay because index page it's just a

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.029
okay because index page it's just a slash.

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039
slash.

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:25.110
slash. Uh so we need a controller

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120
Uh so we need a controller

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.669
Uh so we need a controller and we need a data grid and we need

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679
and we need a data grid and we need

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:32.470
and we need a data grid and we need index page. So for this also please

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480
index page. So for this also please

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.630
index page. So for this also please switch to slides.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640
switch to slides.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.789
switch to slides. Uh because here you have simple grid

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799
Uh because here you have simple grid

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:40.230
Uh because here you have simple grid example and this is

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240
example and this is

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.950
example and this is similar to what you will do. So create a

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960
similar to what you will do. So create a

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.830
similar to what you will do. So create a data grid y file in or subdirectory of

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840
data grid y file in or subdirectory of

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.390
data grid y file in or subdirectory of resources config. In data grids name

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400
resources config. In data grids name

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.710
resources config. In data grids name space name your grid. This name needs to

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720
space name your grid. This name needs to

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.710
space name your grid. This name needs to be unique. It's up to you. Probably

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720
be unique. It's up to you. Probably

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.510
be unique. It's up to you. Probably something like user naming greet or

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520
something like user naming greet or

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.630
something like user naming greet or something. Then specify extended entity

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640
something. Then specify extended entity

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.270
something. Then specify extended entity name. And then this section for source.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.280
name. And then this section for source.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.549
name. And then this section for source. So we're going to fetch everything uh

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559
So we're going to fetch everything uh

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:10.470
So we're going to fetch everything uh label, ID, title, and format from uh

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480
label, ID, title, and format from uh

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.909
label, ID, title, and format from uh this will be our usernaming type entity.

00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919
this will be our usernaming type entity.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.149
this will be our usernaming type entity. And then inside columns, we will not

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159
And then inside columns, we will not

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:18.070
And then inside columns, we will not have one column called label. We will

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080
have one column called label. We will

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.070
have one column called label. We will have two uh one is title, second is

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080
have two uh one is title, second is

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.630
have two uh one is title, second is format.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.190
Uhhuh.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200
Uhhuh.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.870
Uhhuh. Okay. And then we're going to have

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880
Okay. And then we're going to have

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.430
Okay. And then we're going to have actually nothing more for now. So for

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440
actually nothing more for now. So for

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.950
actually nothing more for now. So for now, you're just going to have really

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960
now, you're just going to have really

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.350
now, you're just going to have really simple grid. Name it source extended

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360
simple grid. Name it source extended

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.390
simple grid. Name it source extended entity name and columns.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400
entity name and columns.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.230
entity name and columns. All you need to put is a label for this

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240
All you need to put is a label for this

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.630
All you need to put is a label for this column and that's it. Optional part is

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640
column and that's it. Optional part is

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.470
column and that's it. Optional part is to create it with HTML tweak but that's

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480
to create it with HTML tweak but that's

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.470
to create it with HTML tweak but that's optional part

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480
optional part

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.990
optional part and then we need to have controller.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000
and then we need to have controller.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.390
and then we need to have controller. Uh so for the controller you also have

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400
Uh so for the controller you also have

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.350
Uh so for the controller you also have example here entity index page.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360
example here entity index page.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.029
example here entity index page. Here you have

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.750
index action. Of course you need to

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760
index action. Of course you need to

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.110
index action. Of course you need to create controller first and then create

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120
create controller first and then create

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.990
create controller first and then create this index action similar to this one.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000
this index action similar to this one.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.909
this index action similar to this one. Uh do not forget about routing rout

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919
Uh do not forget about routing rout

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.470
Uh do not forget about routing rout routing file and then the second part

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480
routing file and then the second part

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.750
routing file and then the second part will be to create index template.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760
will be to create index template.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.310
will be to create index template. Okay, so similar to this one, even much

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320
Okay, so similar to this one, even much

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.470
Okay, so similar to this one, even much more much shorter, but I haven't found

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480
more much shorter, but I haven't found

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.630
more much shorter, but I haven't found any simpler example that this one.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640
any simpler example that this one.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.630
any simpler example that this one. That's why you have a link to it. But in

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640
That's why you have a link to it. But in

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.950
That's why you have a link to it. But in your real index html tweak, all you need

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960
your real index html tweak, all you need

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.990
your real index html tweak, all you need to do is extend the base one and then

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000
to do is extend the base one and then

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.909
to do is extend the base one and then specify the greet name that we just

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919
specify the greet name that we just

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.990
specify the greet name that we just created in previous step. So basically

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000
created in previous step. So basically

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.070
created in previous step. So basically line one and three and you're done,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080
line one and three and you're done,

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.430
line one and three and you're done, right? Then whenever you enter this page

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440
right? Then whenever you enter this page

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.669
right? Then whenever you enter this page by the URL still you should see the grid

00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679
by the URL still you should see the grid

00:25:55.679 --> 00:26:01.029
by the URL still you should see the grid of uh usernaming types on your index.

00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039
of uh usernaming types on your index.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.789
of uh usernaming types on your index. Uh then to play around with the data

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799
Uh then to play around with the data

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:05.990
Uh then to play around with the data grid a little bit uh you can add title

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000
grid a little bit uh you can add title

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.230
grid a little bit uh you can add title uh filter and sortter for the title

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240
uh filter and sortter for the title

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.909
uh filter and sortter for the title field and this will be similar to this

00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919
field and this will be similar to this

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:14.789
field and this will be similar to this section. So in the filters you need to

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799
section. So in the filters you need to

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:18.789
section. So in the filters you need to do it for the title column and for the

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799
do it for the title column and for the

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:21.909
do it for the title column and for the sorters here also for the title column.

00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919
sorters here also for the title column.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:24.710
sorters here also for the title column. So not label but title.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720
So not label but title.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.029
So not label but title. And the last part is to add a menu item

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039
And the last part is to add a menu item

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:29.269
And the last part is to add a menu item for naming type index page. Right? So

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279
for naming type index page. Right? So

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.830
for naming type index page. Right? So right now you need to type the URL. We

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840
right now you need to type the URL. We

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.830
right now you need to type the URL. We don't want to do that. We want to have a

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840
don't want to do that. We want to have a

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.630
don't want to do that. We want to have a element in the menu right here. I've

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640
element in the menu right here. I've

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.630
element in the menu right here. I've lost my translations for some reason.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640
lost my translations for some reason.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.149
lost my translations for some reason. Okay. So we want to create this element

00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159
Okay. So we want to create this element

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:53.190
Okay. So we want to create this element and uh to create this element.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.750
Okay.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.470
Uh you need to do it in navigation y

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480
Uh you need to do it in navigation y

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.310
Uh you need to do it in navigation y file inside resources config oro. Uh and

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320
file inside resources config oro. Uh and

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.909
file inside resources config oro. Uh and then actually I yesterday showed you

00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919
then actually I yesterday showed you

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:09.990
then actually I yesterday showed you this exercise when I quickly added um

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000
this exercise when I quickly added um

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.230
this exercise when I quickly added um this. So I'm going to switch back to my

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240
this. So I'm going to switch back to my

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.669
this. So I'm going to switch back to my exercise. Here you have example how to

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679
exercise. Here you have example how to

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:17.830
exercise. Here you have example how to um create items here. So we need to

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840
um create items here. So we need to

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.190
um create items here. So we need to create item for this particular element

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200
create item for this particular element

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.669
create item for this particular element and then put it in some appropriate

00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679
and then put it in some appropriate

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:25.990
and then put it in some appropriate element in the tree.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000
element in the tree.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.390
element in the tree. Uh so similar to what I did yesterday in

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:30.400
Uh so similar to what I did yesterday in

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.750
Uh so similar to what I did yesterday in this short exercise during the

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.750
the session

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760
the session

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.549
the session I added one element

00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559
I added one element

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:43.029
I added one element which was called my custom contacts. So

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039
which was called my custom contacts. So

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:45.430
which was called my custom contacts. So basically under navigation menu item I

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440
basically under navigation menu item I

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.510
basically under navigation menu item I created this one item. This is

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520
created this one item. This is

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.350
created this one item. This is definition of this item. It's not there

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360
definition of this item. It's not there

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.070
definition of this item. It's not there yet displayed anywhere. So right now

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080
yet displayed anywhere. So right now

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.870
yet displayed anywhere. So right now when we have this item we can put it in

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880
when we have this item we can put it in

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.430
when we have this item we can put it in some appropriate place in the tree. For

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440
some appropriate place in the tree. For

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.350
some appropriate place in the tree. For me here it was application menu

00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360
me here it was application menu

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.389
me here it was application menu customers tab. Uh but here you will

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399
customers tab. Uh but here you will

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:04.070
customers tab. Uh but here you will actually want to go under user

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080
actually want to go under user

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.549
actually want to go under user management. So to check for the tree

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559
management. So to check for the tree

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.870
management. So to check for the tree because we want it to be here, you can

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880
because we want it to be here, you can

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.510
because we want it to be here, you can find the definition of this users

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520
find the definition of this users

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.149
find the definition of this users element for example and then check

00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159
element for example and then check

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:18.149
element for example and then check exactly where in the tree is this

00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159
exactly where in the tree is this

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:19.990
exactly where in the tree is this element and in the same place you want

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000
element and in the same place you want

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.549
element and in the same place you want to put our item. Okay. Uh so this will

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559
to put our item. Okay. Uh so this will

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:28.310
to put our item. Okay. Uh so this will be the practice for the data grids and

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320
be the practice for the data grids and

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.070
be the practice for the data grids and and and and index page. Okay. So right

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080
and and and index page. Okay. So right

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.590
and and and index page. Okay. So right now uh we have hour and a half for sure

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600
now uh we have hour and a half for sure

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.909
now uh we have hour and a half for sure for this practice. We'll see how this

00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919

issues for yesterday practice for topic number four with adding the entity and

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520
number four with adding the entity and

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.470
number four with adding the entity and those migrations etc. Now it's going to

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480
those migrations etc. Now it's going to

&gt;&gt; that's about the week. So I have from the first uh uh training I have the

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760
the first uh uh training I have the

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.669
the first uh uh training I have the still having this I have this listener

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679
still having this I have this listener

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:30.549
still having this I have this listener I'm not sure how to use the tweak so I'm

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559
I'm not sure how to use the tweak so I'm

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.389
I'm not sure how to use the tweak so I'm trying to use the folders so I have

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399
trying to use the folders so I have

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:35.110
trying to use the folders so I have tried to put it there

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120
tried to put it there

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.510
tried to put it there with the bundles I have tried to have it

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520
with the bundles I have tried to have it

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.590
with the bundles I have tried to have it within the my bundle it's still not

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600
within the my bundle it's still not

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.750
within the my bundle it's still not finding it for this part

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760
finding it for this part

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.070
finding it for this part &gt;&gt; okay we'll get there in a moment okay I

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080
&gt;&gt; okay we'll get there in a moment okay I

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.029
&gt;&gt; okay we'll get there in a moment okay I will explain you

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039
will explain you

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:49.990
will explain you &gt;&gt; so my question is related to this one so

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000
&gt;&gt; so my question is related to this one so

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.950
&gt;&gt; so my question is related to this one so I'm trying to get the last entity.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.549
So it calls like this

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559
So it calls like this

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:03.190
So it calls like this also if I will open this it's at moment

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200
also if I will open this it's at moment

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.430
also if I will open this it's at moment it's not clear to me so I thought it's

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440
it's not clear to me so I thought it's

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.430
it's not clear to me so I thought it's this one is repres representing the

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440
this one is repres representing the

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.310
this one is repres representing the username naming type and that that is

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320
username naming type and that that is

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.710
username naming type and that that is the type

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720
the type

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.269
the type uh but if take a look there so it's

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279
uh but if take a look there so it's

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:23.830
uh but if take a look there so it's saying something like

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.350
at the different

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360
at the different

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.950
at the different &gt;&gt; he wanted to go to the view page

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960
&gt;&gt; he wanted to go to the view page

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.510
&gt;&gt; he wanted to go to the view page probably. So you're asking me how to

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520
probably. So you're asking me how to

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.070
probably. So you're asking me how to translate the those translation keys or

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080
translate the those translation keys or

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.750
translate the those translation keys or what's actually the question?

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760
what's actually the question?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.830
what's actually the question? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first question why name

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first question why name

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.909
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first question why name says so and the second question was

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919
says so and the second question was

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:41.269
says so and the second question was related so so it record but previously I

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279
related so so it record but previously I

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:43.350
related so so it record but previously I saw the form where it shows this the

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360
saw the form where it shows this the

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.350
saw the form where it shows this the fields and it saying that I have no

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360
fields and it saying that I have no

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.830
fields and it saying that I have no fields for this.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840
fields for this.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.750
fields for this. Okay. Like like this. So I have fields

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760
Okay. Like like this. So I have fields

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.430
Okay. Like like this. So I have fields but it's blank. But it have three

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440
but it's blank. But it have three

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.190
but it's blank. But it have three fields. I'm not sure what it's saying

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200
fields. I'm not sure what it's saying

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.710
fields. I'm not sure what it's saying there. It's blank.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720
there. It's blank.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.830
there. It's blank. &gt;&gt; Uh okay. So if you don't have the fields

00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840
&gt;&gt; Uh okay. So if you don't have the fields

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.990
&gt;&gt; Uh okay. So if you don't have the fields here and you have them in the database.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000
here and you have them in the database.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.870
here and you have them in the database. So either you have some issues with the

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880
So either you have some issues with the

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.190
So either you have some issues with the mapping on your entities

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200
mapping on your entities

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.590
mapping on your entities uh or something wrong happened when you

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600
uh or something wrong happened when you

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.830
uh or something wrong happened when you loaded the migration because here all

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840
loaded the migration because here all

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.909
loaded the migration because here all the extended entities should be and all

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919
the extended entities should be and all

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:15.509
the extended entities should be and all the definitions are taken from the

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519
the definitions are taken from the

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:19.269
the definitions are taken from the database both for fields and so on. So

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279
database both for fields and so on. So

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:21.990
database both for fields and so on. So but let's go back to the uh to those

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000
but let's go back to the uh to those

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.149
but let's go back to the uh to those translations to the labels. So this is

00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159
translations to the labels. So this is

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:26.230
translations to the labels. So this is very okay that you have because Sora out

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240
very okay that you have because Sora out

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.870
very okay that you have because Sora out of the box creates every for every field

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880
of the box creates every for every field

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.470
of the box creates every for every field creates some translation key. Uh why?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480
creates some translation key. Uh why?

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.350
creates some translation key. Uh why? Because then for each translation key uh

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360
Because then for each translation key uh

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.549
Because then for each translation key uh you can specify the real value and we do

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559
you can specify the real value and we do

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:41.750
you can specify the real value and we do this in the messages uh YAML files and

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760
this in the messages uh YAML files and

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.750
this in the messages uh YAML files and messages YAML files they have also

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760
messages YAML files they have also

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.190
messages YAML files they have also language uh part. So I would need to

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200
language uh part. So I would need to

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.590
language uh part. So I would need to share screen to show you this.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600
share screen to show you this.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.630
share screen to show you this. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.630
&gt;&gt; Mhm. uh what I'm talking about because it

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640
uh what I'm talking about because it

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.870
uh what I'm talking about because it will be easier for me to show you

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880
will be easier for me to show you

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.389
will be easier for me to show you this one.

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:01.909
Okay.

00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919
Okay.

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:06.950
Okay. So for every entity uh we do not try to

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960
So for every entity uh we do not try to

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.750
So for every entity uh we do not try to guess what to display and hardcode some

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760
guess what to display and hardcode some

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.430
guess what to display and hardcode some values based on the field name because

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440
values based on the field name because

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.310
values based on the field name because this will be not translatable. Uh so

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320
this will be not translatable. Uh so

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.870
this will be not translatable. Uh so those uh translation keys are created

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880
those uh translation keys are created

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.870
those uh translation keys are created and they are created by some particular

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880
and they are created by some particular

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.350
and they are created by some particular rule. So if we have this entity called

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360
rule. So if we have this entity called

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.549
rule. So if we have this entity called usernaming type here the rule will be uh

00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559
usernaming type here the rule will be uh

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:28.470
usernaming type here the rule will be uh training dot usernaming dot so namespace

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480
training dot usernaming dot so namespace

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.190
training dot usernaming dot so namespace name then bundle name without bundle

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200
name then bundle name without bundle

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.070
name then bundle name without bundle suffix. So training dot usernaming dot

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080
suffix. So training dot usernaming dot

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.950
suffix. So training dot usernaming dot name of the entity so usernaming type

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960
name of the entity so usernaming type

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.310
name of the entity so usernaming type dot then entity label plural label

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320
dot then entity label plural label

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.470
dot then entity label plural label because we need to know how to display

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480
because we need to know how to display

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.950
because we need to know how to display this entity by a single like one

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960
this entity by a single like one

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.830
this entity by a single like one usernaming type or usernaming types. And

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840
usernaming type or usernaming types. And

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.789
usernaming type or usernaming types. And then for each field we're going to have

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799
then for each field we're going to have

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:53.830
then for each field we're going to have uh title dot label. So label for this

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840
uh title dot label. So label for this

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.310
uh title dot label. So label for this field. Uh and those translations are

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320
field. Uh and those translations are

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.630
field. Uh and those translations are created uh automatically those

00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640
created uh automatically those

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.430
created uh automatically those translation keys by exactly those rules.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440
translation keys by exactly those rules.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.269
translation keys by exactly those rules. Right? So training dot username dot

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279
Right? So training dot username dot

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:07.830
Right? So training dot username dot usernaming type dot title dot label. And

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840
usernaming type dot title dot label. And

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.629
usernaming type dot title dot label. And now inside resources translations you

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639
now inside resources translations you

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.869
now inside resources translations you can create messages file.

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:17.349
You can create messages file in which

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359
You can create messages file in which

00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:19.750
You can create messages file in which you specify the real values for those

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760
you specify the real values for those

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.909
you specify the real values for those translation keys. Okay. So we have

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919
translation keys. Okay. So we have

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:24.869
translation keys. Okay. So we have training dot usernaming usernaming type

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879
training dot usernaming usernaming type

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:27.349
training dot usernaming usernaming type then entity label plural label. You can

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359
then entity label plural label. You can

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.349
then entity label plural label. You can have also description you don't need to.

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359
have also description you don't need to.

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.349
have also description you don't need to. And for each field we have field name

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359
And for each field we have field name

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:33.430
And for each field we have field name label field name label field name label

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440
label field name label field name label

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.510
label field name label field name label and values. Okay. And right now our

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520
and values. Okay. And right now our

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.550
and values. Okay. And right now our application if you have this uh uh the

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560
application if you have this uh uh the

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.869
application if you have this uh uh the application will try every time to

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879
application will try every time to

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:43.990
application will try every time to translate those long keys that you see

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000
translate those long keys that you see

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.790
translate those long keys that you see right now with dots uh with the values

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800
right now with dots uh with the values

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.589
right now with dots uh with the values based on your localization. So this is

00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599
based on your localization. So this is

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.589
based on your localization. So this is how we actually do all the translations

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599
how we actually do all the translations

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.270
how we actually do all the translations because right now I can create here

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280
because right now I can create here

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.030
because right now I can create here messages

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040
messages

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.670
messages um es for Spanish. Uh put here Spanish

00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680
um es for Spanish. Uh put here Spanish

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.030
um es for Spanish. Uh put here Spanish values translations of those field

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040
values translations of those field

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.030
values translations of those field change the language in the back office

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040
change the language in the back office

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.349
change the language in the back office uh from English to Spanish and I will

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359
uh from English to Spanish and I will

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:09.990
uh from English to Spanish and I will have all the interface with nice Spanish

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000
have all the interface with nice Spanish

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.710
have all the interface with nice Spanish words. So this is why we have all those

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720
words. So this is why we have all those

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.030
words. So this is why we have all those translations and they are very good that

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040
translations and they are very good that

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.790
translations and they are very good that that they are there. They allow you to

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800
that they are there. They allow you to

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.510
that they are there. They allow you to translate every part of application to

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520
translate every part of application to

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.349
translate every part of application to different language

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359
different language

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:24.550
different language and that's the whole mystery behind it.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560
and that's the whole mystery behind it.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.230
and that's the whole mystery behind it. &gt;&gt; It looks for the whole folder

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240
&gt;&gt; It looks for the whole folder

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.430
&gt;&gt; It looks for the whole folder translations.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.150
I mean I should I register this messages

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160
I mean I should I register this messages

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.589
I mean I should I register this messages somewhere?

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599
somewhere?

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:35.510
somewhere? &gt;&gt; No, you just need to put it in resources

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520
&gt;&gt; No, you just need to put it in resources

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.750
&gt;&gt; No, you just need to put it in resources translations and name it exactly like

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760
translations and name it exactly like

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.190
translations and name it exactly like this. So it's looking for the uh file by

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200
this. So it's looking for the uh file by

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.829
this. So it's looking for the uh file by the domain name. So we have messages for

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839
the domain name. So we have messages for

00:35:43.839 --> 00:35:46.470
the domain name. So we have messages for like standard all messages. Then we'll

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480
like standard all messages. Then we'll

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.870
like standard all messages. Then we'll talk about workflows. So when we create

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880
talk about workflows. So when we create

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.950
talk about workflows. So when we create a workflow there are workflow buttons

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960
a workflow there are workflow buttons

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.950
a workflow there are workflow buttons etc. So for this we just have separate

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960
etc. So for this we just have separate

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.470
etc. So for this we just have separate files. For JS components we have JS

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480
files. For JS components we have JS

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.870
files. For JS components we have JS messages but they all sit in resources

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880
messages but they all sit in resources

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.589
messages but they all sit in resources translations and they are all like in

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599
translations and they are all like in

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.270
translations and they are all like in this format.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280
this format.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.950
this format. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.310
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And then also in your file wherever you

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320
&gt;&gt; And then also in your file wherever you

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.950
&gt;&gt; And then also in your file wherever you want. Uh basically if I right click and

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960
want. Uh basically if I right click and

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.069
want. Uh basically if I right click and copy reference now I have this whole uh

00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079
copy reference now I have this whole uh

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:19.190
copy reference now I have this whole uh key here. So let me open any

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.349
anything to show you because right now

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359
anything to show you because right now

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:24.230
anything to show you because right now oh actually it's here right. So to trans

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240
oh actually it's here right. So to trans

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.069
oh actually it's here right. So to trans to use it in a tweak there is this tweak

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079
to use it in a tweak there is this tweak

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:31.589
to use it in a tweak there is this tweak uh filter to translate. Okay. So you are

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599
uh filter to translate. Okay. So you are

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:34.630
uh filter to translate. Okay. So you are just passing the key and saying that it

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640
just passing the key and saying that it

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.790
just passing the key and saying that it should be translated and right now it's

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800
should be translated and right now it's

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.550
should be translated and right now it's cool because the page title will be

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560
cool because the page title will be

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.750
cool because the page title will be translated and changed to appropriate

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760
translated and changed to appropriate

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.829
translated and changed to appropriate value based on the definitions from for

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839
value based on the definitions from for

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:46.310
value based on the definitions from for example from here right so this will be

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320
example from here right so this will be

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.870
example from here right so this will be translated to Spanish German whatever

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880
translated to Spanish German whatever

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.870
translated to Spanish German whatever language

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880
language

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.430
language user will pick

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440
user will pick

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.670
user will pick in the UI

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.230
&gt;&gt; and the issue with my fields as far I

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240
&gt;&gt; and the issue with my fields as far I

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.790
&gt;&gt; and the issue with my fields as far I And so from your screen is the usage of

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800
And so from your screen is the usage of

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.670
And so from your screen is the usage of the conf field annotation within the

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680
the conf field annotation within the

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.750
the conf field annotation within the each field

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760
each field

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.710
each field I'm using within the entity.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720
I'm using within the entity.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.030
I'm using within the entity. &gt;&gt; The config annotation

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040
&gt;&gt; The config annotation

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.829
&gt;&gt; The config annotation this is actually solution for

00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839
this is actually solution for

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.829
this is actually solution for &gt;&gt; everything.

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839
&gt;&gt; everything.

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:23.030
&gt;&gt; everything. Uh yeah, config annotation is only here,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040
Uh yeah, config annotation is only here,

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.670
Uh yeah, config annotation is only here, &gt;&gt; right? And for the for the fields, I saw

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680
&gt;&gt; right? And for the for the fields, I saw

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.630
&gt;&gt; right? And for the for the fields, I saw you have something like config field.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be if I want to add

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be if I want to add

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be if I want to add some additional configuration for per

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640
some additional configuration for per

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.630
some additional configuration for per field, then I would have it there, but

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640
field, then I would have it there, but

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.630
field, then I would have it there, but we don't need it yet. We don't want to

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640
we don't need it yet. We don't want to

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.829
we don't need it yet. We don't want to do anything custom for the fields yet.

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839
do anything custom for the fields yet.

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:44.390
do anything custom for the fields yet. &gt;&gt; Then I'm not sure why I I can see the

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400
&gt;&gt; Then I'm not sure why I I can see the

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.790
&gt;&gt; Then I'm not sure why I I can see the entity with the blanks on the fields at

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800
entity with the blanks on the fields at

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.510
entity with the blanks on the fields at all.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520
all.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.589
all. because I have this column like you have

00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599
because I have this column like you have

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:54.710
because I have this column like you have on your screen.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720
on your screen.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.630
on your screen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you share back the screen? So,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can you share back the screen? So,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.630
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can you share back the screen? So, we'll try to

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640
we'll try to

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:27.349
we'll try to &gt;&gt; check

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:29.829
Okay. And can you show me your uh

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839
Okay. And can you show me your uh

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:56.150
Okay. And can you show me your uh installer

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.109
Okay. And uh in database you have the

00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119
Okay. And uh in database you have the

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:05.990
Okay. And uh in database you have the table with three elements.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.190
Okay. You have even loaded the

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200
Okay. You have even loaded the

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.790
Okay. You have even loaded the uh

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800
uh

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.870
uh it.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.790
Okay.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800
Okay.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.390
Okay. And can you

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.670
&gt;&gt; can be kind of care.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.190
&gt;&gt; It's hard to tell what actually

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200
&gt;&gt; It's hard to tell what actually

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.030
&gt;&gt; It's hard to tell what actually happened. So you can execute one

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040
happened. So you can execute one

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.030
happened. So you can execute one comment. If it will not help, I will

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040
comment. If it will not help, I will

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.430
comment. If it will not help, I will just ask you to remove cache and just

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440
just ask you to remove cache and just

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.510
just ask you to remove cache and just execute platform update. Okay, so we'll

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520
execute platform update. Okay, so we'll

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.270
execute platform update. Okay, so we'll make sure that like the whole

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280
make sure that like the whole

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.230
make sure that like the whole application is is rebuilt. Okay.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240
application is is rebuilt. Okay.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.790
application is is rebuilt. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh so first please execute I'm searching

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800
&gt;&gt; Uh so first please execute I'm searching

00:39:48.800 --> 00:40:06.630
&gt;&gt; Uh so first please execute I'm searching for the comment.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.390
Okay. So the uh Oro entity config update

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400
Okay. So the uh Oro entity config update

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.990
Okay. So the uh Oro entity config update I sent it on the chat in the meeting.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.470
So we'll check after this. And yes, you

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480
So we'll check after this. And yes, you

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:48.310
So we'll check after this. And yes, you can remove cache before doing that.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.109
By the way, is it uh okay that it's

00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119
By the way, is it uh okay that it's

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:55.030
By the way, is it uh okay that it's always saying this duplicated?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.990
&gt;&gt; I don't see this actually on my site.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000
&gt;&gt; I don't see this actually on my site.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.470
&gt;&gt; I don't see this actually on my site. Maybe you have some different setting

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480
Maybe you have some different setting

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.109
Maybe you have some different setting for your PHP in

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119
for your PHP in

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.670
for your PHP in &gt;&gt; right. Yeah, it's totally different PHP

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680
&gt;&gt; right. Yeah, it's totally different PHP

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.630
&gt;&gt; right. Yeah, it's totally different PHP any that we have. So

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640
any that we have. So

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.109
any that we have. So &gt;&gt; yeah, there are some duplications there

00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119
&gt;&gt; yeah, there are some duplications there

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:14.710
&gt;&gt; yeah, there are some duplications there are. Yep, they will be removed in next

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720
are. Yep, they will be removed in next

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.750
are. Yep, they will be removed in next version and changed with other other

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760
version and changed with other other

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.349
version and changed with other other things will be duplicated in next

00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359
things will be duplicated in next

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:21.030
things will be duplicated in next version.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040
version.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.109
version. So yeah, we are marking some things as

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119
So yeah, we are marking some things as

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:25.190
So yeah, we are marking some things as deprecated ones in code to make sure not

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200
deprecated ones in code to make sure not

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.230
deprecated ones in code to make sure not to use them in next versions. So that's

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240
to use them in next versions. So that's

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.990
to use them in next versions. So that's normal

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000
normal

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.190
normal in case you're asking for this. Um,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200
in case you're asking for this. Um,

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:40.550
in case you're asking for this. Um, okay. It can take a second

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.470
by the way because I see that you're

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480
by the way because I see that you're

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.950
by the way because I see that you're using clear cache command from uh

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960
using clear cache command from uh

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.470
using clear cache command from uh symfony.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480
symfony.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.030
symfony. Uh I also strongly advise to just remove

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040
Uh I also strongly advise to just remove

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.750
Uh I also strongly advise to just remove the content of the cache directory uh

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760
the content of the cache directory uh

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.990
the content of the cache directory uh because it's faster and you will be sure

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000
because it's faster and you will be sure

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.589
because it's faster and you will be sure that it will remove everything because

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599
that it will remove everything because

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.670
that it will remove everything because there are some aura functionalities that

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680
there are some aura functionalities that

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.550
there are some aura functionalities that symfony clear cache is not able to clear

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560
symfony clear cache is not able to clear

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.230
symfony clear cache is not able to clear because symfony doesn't know anything

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240
because symfony doesn't know anything

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.150
because symfony doesn't know anything about aura. It's auro that knows about

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160
about aura. It's auro that knows about

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.870
about aura. It's auro that knows about symfony.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880
symfony.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.349
symfony. &gt;&gt; Sure. Is this only one folder where

00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359
&gt;&gt; Sure. Is this only one folder where

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:08.950
&gt;&gt; Sure. Is this only one folder where cache or it's cash?

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960
cache or it's cash?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.910
cache or it's cash? &gt;&gt; No, just one folder. So basically uh

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920
&gt;&gt; No, just one folder. So basically uh

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.790
&gt;&gt; No, just one folder. So basically uh just remember to remove the content. So

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800
just remember to remove the content. So

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.030
just remember to remove the content. So v/cashsterisk

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040
v/cashsterisk

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.589
v/cashsterisk and do not forget about this asterisk.

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599
and do not forget about this asterisk.

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:20.390
and do not forget about this asterisk. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:27.910
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And that's it.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.390
&gt;&gt; I'm just asking for this in the practice

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400
&gt;&gt; I'm just asking for this in the practice

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.550
&gt;&gt; I'm just asking for this in the practice from the magenta it's also have some

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560
from the magenta it's also have some

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.550
from the magenta it's also have some another caches and the radius and the

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560
another caches and the radius and the

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.589
another caches and the radius and the other stuff and without this common

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599
other stuff and without this common

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:40.630
other stuff and without this common clearing pretty difficult to get clean

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640
clearing pretty difficult to get clean

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.990
clearing pretty difficult to get clean of those other caches.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000
of those other caches.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.069
of those other caches. Yeah. So we do use radius too but

00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079
Yeah. So we do use radius too but

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:49.190
Yeah. So we do use radius too but actually locally while developing not

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200
actually locally while developing not

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.510
actually locally while developing not really so often.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520
really so often.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.870
really so often. Uh and on our server yes because we have

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880
Uh and on our server yes because we have

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.829
Uh and on our server yes because we have those radius cache etc. we have separate

00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839
those radius cache etc. we have separate

00:42:57.839 --> 00:43:00.230
those radius cache etc. we have separate command there to clear cache. So there

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240
command there to clear cache. So there

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.230
command there to clear cache. So there if you were going to use Oro cloud

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240
if you were going to use Oro cloud

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.109
if you were going to use Oro cloud servers there is going to be separate

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119
servers there is going to be separate

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:09.109
servers there is going to be separate command set called called Orocloud CLI

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119
command set called called Orocloud CLI

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.430
command set called called Orocloud CLI and there is separate uh command to

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440
and there is separate uh command to

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.109
and there is separate uh command to clear cache and it's clearing

00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119
clear cache and it's clearing

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.470
clear cache and it's clearing everything.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480
everything.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.349
everything. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.190
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So in real life yeah we're going to have

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200
&gt;&gt; So in real life yeah we're going to have

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.430
&gt;&gt; So in real life yeah we're going to have it too. It's taking really

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440
it too. It's taking really

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.430
it too. It's taking really &gt;&gt; yeah it's taking a time. We can continue

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440
&gt;&gt; yeah it's taking a time. We can continue

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.670
&gt;&gt; yeah it's taking a time. We can continue while I will just check and let you know

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680
while I will just check and let you know

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.109
while I will just check and let you know if it work or not.

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119
if it work or not.

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:29.829
if it work or not. I think it's taking too long. So let

00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839
I think it's taking too long. So let

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:31.829
I think it's taking too long. So let let's let let's

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839
let's let let's

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.750
let's let let's let let it finish while you can

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760
let let it finish while you can

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.790
let let it finish while you can continue.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800
continue.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.109
continue. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I just basically finished

00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just basically finished

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:39.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just basically finished explaining the practice. So now it's the

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760
explaining the practice. So now it's the

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.829
explaining the practice. So now it's the time for you to do the practice about

00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839
time for you to do the practice about

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:45.109
time for you to do the practice about data grids and index page.

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119
data grids and index page.

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:55.750
data grids and index page. So

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.510
Okay,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.270
question and

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280
question and

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:15.030
question and share the screen.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.550
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen?

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen?

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.630
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen? &gt;&gt; Mhm. Yes. Um you see I have this uh

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yes. Um you see I have this uh

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.750
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yes. Um you see I have this uh migration version one two in the

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760
migration version one two in the

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.190
migration version one two in the installer.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200
installer.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.630
installer. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.990
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; But in the scheme I have uh two and

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000
&gt;&gt; But in the scheme I have uh two and

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.950
&gt;&gt; But in the scheme I have uh two and three.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960
three.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.990
three. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.309
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh so I expect that only two is

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319
&gt;&gt; Uh so I expect that only two is

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:38.230
&gt;&gt; Uh so I expect that only two is executed.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240
executed.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.190
executed. &gt;&gt; Uh the number three will be executed.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200
&gt;&gt; Uh the number three will be executed.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.790
&gt;&gt; Uh the number three will be executed. But this actually is based not on what

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800
But this actually is based not on what

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.109
But this actually is based not on what you have in files but what you have in

00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119
you have in files but what you have in

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:47.910
you have in files but what you have in database. So in case you mixed something

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920
database. So in case you mixed something

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.349
database. So in case you mixed something in your database, it will execute

00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359
in your database, it will execute

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:54.309
in your database, it will execute um appropriate elements. So please open

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319
um appropriate elements. So please open

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:59.130
um appropriate elements. So please open or of migrations

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.510
[Music]

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520
[Music]

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.270
[Music] or migrations table

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280
or migrations table

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.190
or migrations table and you have like total mix here. So

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200
and you have like total mix here. So

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.470
and you have like total mix here. So yeah, we did remove some roles manually

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480
yeah, we did remove some roles manually

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.550
yeah, we did remove some roles manually and this happens when you try to trick

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560
and this happens when you try to trick

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.470
and this happens when you try to trick application and remove roles manually

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480
application and remove roles manually

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.710
application and remove roles manually from here.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720
from here.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.150
from here. Uh so

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160
Uh so

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.309
Uh so okay so basically version is 1.1 so it

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319
okay so basically version is 1.1 so it

00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:29.349
okay so basically version is 1.1 so it will load all the migrations above the

00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359
will load all the migrations above the

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:32.069
will load all the migrations above the version one_1. So it will load both

00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079
version one_1. So it will load both

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.230
version one_1. So it will load both migrations for you number two and number

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240
migrations for you number two and number

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.030
migrations for you number two and number three. It does not care about this

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040
three. It does not care about this

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.230
three. It does not care about this version or what

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240
version or what

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.470
version or what &gt;&gt; it cares but at the end of processing

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480
&gt;&gt; it cares but at the end of processing

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.950
&gt;&gt; it cares but at the end of processing the messages. First it checks what your

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960
the messages. First it checks what your

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.109
the messages. First it checks what your application is up to date and your

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119
application is up to date and your

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:47.430
application is up to date and your database tell you that the application

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440
database tell you that the application

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.390
database tell you that the application is up to date with version 1.1. Then it

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400
is up to date with version 1.1. Then it

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.430
is up to date with version 1.1. Then it executes code and updates the database

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440
executes code and updates the database

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.270
executes code and updates the database from the version from here from

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280
from the version from here from

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.829
from the version from here from installer.

00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:01.510
And this just tells you that the

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520
And this just tells you that the

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.510
And this just tells you that the installer is up to date with some

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520
installer is up to date with some

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.230
installer is up to date with some particular migration. So if you check

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240
particular migration. So if you check

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.550
particular migration. So if you check your Ouro migrations table right now,

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560
your Ouro migrations table right now,

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.630
your Ouro migrations table right now, you will see there only one underscore

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640
you will see there only one underscore

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.589
you will see there only one underscore one which means that all the migrations

00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599
one which means that all the migrations

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:16.710
one which means that all the migrations above will be executed.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720
above will be executed.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:23.750
above will be executed. Yeah, I mean um I I I thought that uh

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760
Yeah, I mean um I I I thought that uh

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.790
Yeah, I mean um I I I thought that uh um or it um

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800
um or it um

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.990
um or it um it tries to apply the versions uh based

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000
it tries to apply the versions uh based

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.150
it tries to apply the versions uh based on the installer.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160
on the installer.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.150
on the installer. &gt;&gt; No, based on the database, the other way

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160
&gt;&gt; No, based on the database, the other way

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.069
&gt;&gt; No, based on the database, the other way around. First, it checks what's in the

00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079
around. First, it checks what's in the

00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:40.710
around. First, it checks what's in the database because database keeps track of

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720
database because database keeps track of

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.950
database because database keeps track of your application status. The code can be

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960
your application status. The code can be

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.990
your application status. The code can be changed and pushed, right? Yeah, it it

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000
changed and pushed, right? Yeah, it it

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.550
changed and pushed, right? Yeah, it it compares database with the installer

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560
compares database with the installer

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.589
compares database with the installer version. But I see that.

00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599
version. But I see that.

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:53.750
version. But I see that. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't compare with the

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760
&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't compare with the

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.670
&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't compare with the installer. Okay. So, probably I

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680
installer. Okay. So, probably I

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.150
installer. Okay. So, probably I explained it badly. Uh because this is

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160
explained it badly. Uh because this is

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.430
explained it badly. Uh because this is not what I meant. It's going to check

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440
not what I meant. It's going to check

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.870
not what I meant. It's going to check only what you have in database. Okay.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880
only what you have in database. Okay.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.270
only what you have in database. Okay. Inside the database in Oro migrations,

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280
Inside the database in Oro migrations,

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.670
Inside the database in Oro migrations, it's going to check and this version

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680
it's going to check and this version

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.190
it's going to check and this version one_1,

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200
one_1,

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.069
one_1, this is your real application version.

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079
this is your real application version.

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:16.870
this is your real application version. Okay. So it base it's basing only on the

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880
Okay. So it base it's basing only on the

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.670
Okay. So it base it's basing only on the database because here you have uh your

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680
database because here you have uh your

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.510
database because here you have uh your build state of your so it will try to

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520
build state of your so it will try to

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.109
build state of your so it will try to execute every migration above one. So it

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119
execute every migration above one. So it

00:47:25.119 --> 00:47:27.190
execute every migration above one. So it now it's trying execute both migrations

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200
now it's trying execute both migrations

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.710
now it's trying execute both migrations for you because you have migration

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720
for you because you have migration

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.030
for you because you have migration number two and migration number three.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040
number two and migration number three.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.870
number two and migration number three. And actually the error that I saw in the

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880
And actually the error that I saw in the

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.870
And actually the error that I saw in the console is because you're trying to

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880
console is because you're trying to

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.270
console is because you're trying to execute once more the migration number

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280
execute once more the migration number

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.069
execute once more the migration number two which is adding relation for you.

00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079
two which is adding relation for you.

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:44.230
two which is adding relation for you. &gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's true. So um it

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's true. So um it

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's true. So um it doesn't care about this version just uh

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200
doesn't care about this version just uh

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.910
doesn't care about this version just uh search for all migrations and executed

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920
search for all migrations and executed

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.230
search for all migrations and executed one one by one. Um it will execute the

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240
one one by one. Um it will execute the

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.150
one one by one. Um it will execute the migration number two and migration

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160
migration number two and migration

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.790
migration number two and migration number three. It will note that fact

00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800
number three. It will note that fact

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.109
number three. It will note that fact after those migrations will be executed.

00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119
after those migrations will be executed.

00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:03.430
after those migrations will be executed. It will note that fact in the database

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440
It will note that fact in the database

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.349
It will note that fact in the database in Oro migrations uh table and later on

00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359
in Oro migrations uh table and later on

00:48:07.359 --> 00:48:09.670
in Oro migrations uh table and later on when you execute the command it will

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680
when you execute the command it will

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.069
when you execute the command it will again look into or migrations but see

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079
again look into or migrations but see

00:48:12.079 --> 00:48:14.950
again look into or migrations but see there that uh the migration number three

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960
there that uh the migration number three

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.670
there that uh the migration number three is already executed. So it will not

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680
is already executed. So it will not

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.910
is already executed. So it will not execute anything once more. And for the

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920
execute anything once more. And for the

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.829
execute anything once more. And for the installer is that that at the end of um

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:29.109
&gt;&gt; migration process uh when you add any

00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119
&gt;&gt; migration process uh when you add any

00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:31.910
&gt;&gt; migration process uh when you add any change to migration

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920
change to migration

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.309
change to migration then you also want to add it to

00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319
then you also want to add it to

00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:36.549
then you also want to add it to installer because next time when someone

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559
installer because next time when someone

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:40.470
installer because next time when someone will uh execute this from scratch it

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480
will uh execute this from scratch it

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.150
will uh execute this from scratch it will in uh execute your installer and

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160
will in uh execute your installer and

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.230
will in uh execute your installer and all the

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240
all the

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.549
all the uh migrations that are above the version

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559
uh migrations that are above the version

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:51.030
uh migrations that are above the version from from the installer. So it's using

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040
from from the installer. So it's using

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.990
from from the installer. So it's using this installer get version but in

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000
this installer get version but in

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.109
this installer get version but in different situation. When you install

00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119
different situation. When you install

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.589
different situation. When you install bundle from scratch, it will do the

00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599
bundle from scratch, it will do the

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:02.710
bundle from scratch, it will do the installer and all the migrations above

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720
installer and all the migrations above

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.349
installer and all the migrations above the version that you have specified in

00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359
the version that you have specified in

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:07.910
the version that you have specified in the installer. This is happening only

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920
the installer. This is happening only

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.150
the installer. This is happening only when you don't have any thing in your

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160
when you don't have any thing in your

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.829
when you don't have any thing in your database. Right? When you install the

00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839
database. Right? When you install the

00:49:11.839 --> 00:49:14.870
database. Right? When you install the pro the bundle from scratch, it doesn't

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880
pro the bundle from scratch, it doesn't

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.270
pro the bundle from scratch, it doesn't exist in a database yet. So when you

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280
exist in a database yet. So when you

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.510
exist in a database yet. So when you install it, there's no entrance about it

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520
install it, there's no entrance about it

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.030
install it, there's no entrance about it in Oro migrations table yet. And in this

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040
in Oro migrations table yet. And in this

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.349
in Oro migrations table yet. And in this particular situation, it's executing the

00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359
particular situation, it's executing the

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:26.870
particular situation, it's executing the installer

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880
installer

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.109
installer and all the mig migrations above the

00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119
and all the mig migrations above the

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:31.270
and all the mig migrations above the version that you have in the installer

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280
version that you have in the installer

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.069
version that you have in the installer in this particular case only.

00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079
in this particular case only.

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:37.109
in this particular case only. &gt;&gt; Yeah, very good.

00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good.

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good. Thank you.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240
Thank you.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.069
Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yep. So now you're trying to uh execute

00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079
&gt;&gt; Yep. So now you're trying to uh execute

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.309
&gt;&gt; Yep. So now you're trying to uh execute again the migration number two which is

00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319
again the migration number two which is

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:46.630
again the migration number two which is adding relation between user and

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640
adding relation between user and

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.470
adding relation between user and usernaming type and that's why you have

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480
usernaming type and that's why you have

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.990
usernaming type and that's why you have an error because this relation is

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000
an error because this relation is

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.750
an error because this relation is already in your database.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760
already in your database.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.230
already in your database. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you need to go to your or migrations

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640
&gt;&gt; So you need to go to your or migrations

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.630
&gt;&gt; So you need to go to your or migrations table and just change the version there

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640
table and just change the version there

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:03.829
table and just change the version there to one2.

00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:05.030
Thank you.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040
Thank you.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.790
Thank you. Yep.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800
Yep.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.190
Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw in some of the sort of core

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw in some of the sort of core

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.069
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw in some of the sort of core code it would the migrations would

00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079
code it would the migrations would

00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:13.589
code it would the migrations would actually reference methods in the

00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599
actually reference methods in the

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:16.230
actually reference methods in the installer to try and keep things in sync

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240
installer to try and keep things in sync

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.470
installer to try and keep things in sync so there wasn't like duplicated code. So

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480
so there wasn't like duplicated code. So

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.510
so there wasn't like duplicated code. So that might be a way to kind of make sure

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520
that might be a way to kind of make sure

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.750
that might be a way to kind of make sure &gt;&gt; all the code for your migrations and

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760
&gt;&gt; all the code for your migrations and

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.150
&gt;&gt; all the code for your migrations and installers the same.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160
installers the same.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.069
installers the same. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a fan of this. You can do

00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a fan of this. You can do

00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:30.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a fan of this. You can do this in this particular situation like

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240
this in this particular situation like

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.829
this in this particular situation like we have for this relation. This is uh

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839
we have for this relation. This is uh

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:38.150
we have for this relation. This is uh actually true. You can reuse the

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160
actually true. You can reuse the

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.470
actually true. You can reuse the &gt;&gt; something from uh from the migration.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480
&gt;&gt; something from uh from the migration.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.870
&gt;&gt; something from uh from the migration. But in most cases, we don't have

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880
But in most cases, we don't have

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.190
But in most cases, we don't have situations like this. We are more like

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200
situations like this. We are more like

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.549
situations like this. We are more like adding one field, right? So for example,

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559
adding one field, right? So for example,

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:52.870
adding one field, right? So for example, if my migration

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880
if my migration

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.790
if my migration Okay, I'm share screen.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800
Okay, I'm share screen.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.309
Okay, I'm share screen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't saying this always

00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't saying this always

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.829
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't saying this always applies. As I was just saying in some

00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839
applies. As I was just saying in some

00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:00.390
applies. As I was just saying in some cases where the code is going to be

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400
cases where the code is going to be

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.790
cases where the code is going to be identical rarely very rarely because

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800
identical rarely very rarely because

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.470
identical rarely very rarely because even right now if I want to change

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480
even right now if I want to change

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.030
even right now if I want to change anything in here in this configuration

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040
anything in here in this configuration

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.910
anything in here in this configuration my next migration will have just a query

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920
my next migration will have just a query

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.390
my next migration will have just a query and I cannot reuse it. Uh it will be

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400
and I cannot reuse it. Uh it will be

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.470
and I cannot reuse it. Uh it will be better to go to installer and change it.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480
better to go to installer and change it.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.390
better to go to installer and change it. And for example if I want to add a

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400
And for example if I want to add a

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.309
And for example if I want to add a another field like um example like some

00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319
another field like um example like some

00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:22.950
another field like um example like some field to this string another string like

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960
field to this string another string like

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.589
field to this string another string like let's say name. Okay. So my migration

00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599
let's say name. Okay. So my migration

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:29.270
let's say name. Okay. So my migration will actually do get table add column

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280
will actually do get table add column

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.750
will actually do get table add column and in the installer I will not I'm not

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760
and in the installer I will not I'm not

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.190
and in the installer I will not I'm not going to create separate method for

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200
going to create separate method for

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.950
going to create separate method for this. I'm just going to add this line

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960
this. I'm just going to add this line

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.870
this. I'm just going to add this line here to add column. Right? So this

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880
here to add column. Right? So this

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.270
here to add column. Right? So this applies actually very rarely in this

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280
applies actually very rarely in this

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.510
applies actually very rarely in this particular case that we have uh in this

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520
particular case that we have uh in this

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.190
particular case that we have uh in this practice it's yeah

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200
practice it's yeah

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.589
practice it's yeah &gt;&gt; it's copy pasting but this happens not

00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599
&gt;&gt; it's copy pasting but this happens not

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:56.950
&gt;&gt; it's copy pasting but this happens not so often. Yep.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.950
Yes.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Jaclyn, uh, some issue with the

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Jaclyn, uh, some issue with the

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Jaclyn, uh, some issue with the routing. So, cannot find the reason I

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480
routing. So, cannot find the reason I

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.270
routing. So, cannot find the reason I train that the routing is not exist. Can

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280
train that the routing is not exist. Can

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:18.950
train that the routing is not exist. Can I share the screen?

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.230
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I I she's just very silent.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I I she's just very silent.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.109
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I I she's just very silent. I'm not sure. It's probably my side, but

00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119
I'm not sure. It's probably my side, but

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:27.589
I'm not sure. It's probably my side, but &gt;&gt; I may be also losing my internet from

00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599
&gt;&gt; I may be also losing my internet from

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:31.109
&gt;&gt; I may be also losing my internet from time to time. Recently, it happens.

00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119
time to time. Recently, it happens.

00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:35.829
time to time. Recently, it happens. &gt;&gt; So, if it's a bad connection, then I can

00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839
&gt;&gt; So, if it's a bad connection, then I can

00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:39.430
&gt;&gt; So, if it's a bad connection, then I can &gt;&gt; Okay. So when

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440
&gt;&gt; Okay. So when

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.030
&gt;&gt; Okay. So when uh I have this user management with the

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040
uh I have this user management with the

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.270
uh I have this user management with the navigation but while I'm trying to use

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280
navigation but while I'm trying to use

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.230
navigation but while I'm trying to use the road instead something stop so it's

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240
the road instead something stop so it's

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.390
the road instead something stop so it's saying that the routing doesn't exist

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400
saying that the routing doesn't exist

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.470
saying that the routing doesn't exist &gt;&gt; and do you have this route

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480
&gt;&gt; and do you have this route

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.190
&gt;&gt; and do you have this route &gt;&gt; I have wrote so

00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200
&gt;&gt; I have wrote so

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.510
&gt;&gt; I have wrote so I understood it should match with this

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520
I understood it should match with this

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.309
I understood it should match with this one

00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319
one

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:05.030
one &gt;&gt; no that's just some identifier for the

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040
&gt;&gt; no that's just some identifier for the

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.430
&gt;&gt; no that's just some identifier for the definition of the route uh the route

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440
definition of the route uh the route

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.670
definition of the route uh the route name is the actual um it should lead to

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680
name is the actual um it should lead to

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.349
name is the actual um it should lead to some particular action in your

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359
some particular action in your

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:15.750
some particular action in your controller. Okay. So in this usernaming

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760
controller. Okay. So in this usernaming

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.230
controller. Okay. So in this usernaming type controller you can have multiple

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240
type controller you can have multiple

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.390
type controller you can have multiple routes. Here we have only index action

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400
routes. Here we have only index action

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.030
routes. Here we have only index action but then next session will create a view

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040
but then next session will create a view

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.109
but then next session will create a view action and so on. So the route always

00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119
action and so on. So the route always

00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:27.190
action and so on. So the route always leads to some particular action here.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200
leads to some particular action here.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.309
leads to some particular action here. That's why you have here this uh you can

00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319
That's why you have here this uh you can

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:32.390
That's why you have here this uh you can get rid of ACL ancestor because you

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400
get rid of ACL ancestor because you

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.390
get rid of ACL ancestor because you don't have ACL rules yet because you

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400
don't have ACL rules yet because you

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.670
don't have ACL rules yet because you don't know how to create them because

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680
don't know how to create them because

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.670
don't know how to create them because this is our last topic,

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680
this is our last topic,

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.190
this is our last topic, &gt;&gt; right?

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200
&gt;&gt; right?

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.030
&gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So the next

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So the next

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So the next &gt;&gt; Oh, so if I will remove template it will

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, so if I will remove template it will

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.190
&gt;&gt; Oh, so if I will remove template it will work or not?

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200
work or not?

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.510
work or not? &gt;&gt; No, you need to have a template. Okay,

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520
&gt;&gt; No, you need to have a template. Okay,

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.470
&gt;&gt; No, you need to have a template. Okay, wait a second. So you uh want to create

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480
wait a second. So you uh want to create

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.549
wait a second. So you uh want to create a route. So you want a name that will

00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559
a route. So you want a name that will

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.870
a route. So you want a name that will lead to particular action in your

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880
lead to particular action in your

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.030
lead to particular action in your controller. And to do this you use this

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040
controller. And to do this you use this

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.870
controller. And to do this you use this at route annotation that you have here

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880
at route annotation that you have here

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.309
at route annotation that you have here and it is very correct. Uh and the name

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319
and it is very correct. Uh and the name

00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:04.950
and it is very correct. Uh and the name this is exactly what you want to use.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960
this is exactly what you want to use.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.790
this is exactly what you want to use. Okay. So this route this can be slashed

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800
Okay. So this route this can be slashed

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.190
Okay. So this route this can be slashed but for the view this will be view slash

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200
but for the view this will be view slash

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.589
but for the view this will be view slash and some parameter. So you need to have

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599
and some parameter. So you need to have

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:13.750
and some parameter. So you need to have some name for this route and this name

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760
some name for this route and this name

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.270
some name for this route and this name this is exactly what you how you refer

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280
this is exactly what you how you refer

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.670
this is exactly what you how you refer to it. Okay.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680
to it. Okay.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.230
to it. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240
&gt;&gt; Uh

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.430
&gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; but it would be something like index.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440
&gt;&gt; but it would be something like index.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.549
&gt;&gt; but it would be something like index. No, this is a name like your identifier.

00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559
No, this is a name like your identifier.

00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:29.109
No, this is a name like your identifier. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:30.549
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You mean one

00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559
&gt;&gt; You mean one

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:33.510
&gt;&gt; You mean one &gt;&gt; if you check.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520
&gt;&gt; if you check.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.910
&gt;&gt; if you check. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first part is the real um

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first part is the real um

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the first part is the real um route that you will type inside in your

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280
route that you will type inside in your

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.150
route that you will type inside in your browser in the URL. The second is the

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160
browser in the URL. The second is the

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.150
browser in the URL. The second is the name is some identifier that you will

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160
name is some identifier that you will

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.150
name is some identifier that you will refer to this uh route with this

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160
refer to this uh route with this

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.230
refer to this uh route with this identifier.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240
identifier.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.630
identifier. Um and as uh you will see in every our

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640
Um and as uh you will see in every our

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.190
Um and as uh you will see in every our bundles index action usually is just a

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200
bundles index action usually is just a

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.589
bundles index action usually is just a slash right. So you just enter some

00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599
slash right. So you just enter some

00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:02.470
slash right. So you just enter some particular URL and then you have index

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480
particular URL and then you have index

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.030
particular URL and then you have index action. If you type slash view slash id

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040
action. If you type slash view slash id

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.750
action. If you type slash view slash id &gt;&gt; then you will have a view of it. Okay.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760
&gt;&gt; then you will have a view of it. Okay.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.870
&gt;&gt; then you will have a view of it. Okay. And if you want to put a prefix then you

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880
And if you want to put a prefix then you

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.750
And if you want to put a prefix then you do it exactly in your routing yl file

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760
do it exactly in your routing yl file

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.230
do it exactly in your routing yl file because in your routing uh can you uh

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240
because in your routing uh can you uh

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.349
because in your routing uh can you uh open routing y file here you define that

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359
open routing y file here you define that

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:23.990
open routing y file here you define that in this controller you will have further

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000
in this controller you will have further

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.630
in this controller you will have further definitions but all of those urls in the

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640
definitions but all of those urls in the

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.270
definitions but all of those urls in the controller will be prefixed with this.

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280
controller will be prefixed with this.

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.549
controller will be prefixed with this. Okay. So here you want to keep slash.

00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559
Okay. So here you want to keep slash.

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:35.270
Okay. So here you want to keep slash. Then the name of this route is training

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280
Then the name of this route is training

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.950
Then the name of this route is training usernaming type preferably also at index

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960
usernaming type preferably also at index

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.870
usernaming type preferably also at index there because later on we will create a

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880
there because later on we will create a

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.190
there because later on we will create a view. Uh so you will have training

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200
view. Uh so you will have training

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.190
view. Uh so you will have training usernaming type view and so on. Those

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200
usernaming type view and so on. Those

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.670
usernaming type view and so on. Those names needs to be unique per route.

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680
names needs to be unique per route.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.349
names needs to be unique per route. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:52.150
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh and this name of the route that

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160
&gt;&gt; Uh and this name of the route that

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.390
&gt;&gt; Uh and this name of the route that you're now hovering over this is the one

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400
you're now hovering over this is the one

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.230
you're now hovering over this is the one that you want to use in your navigation

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240
that you want to use in your navigation

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.990
that you want to use in your navigation YAML file.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000
YAML file.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:30.390
YAML file. &gt;&gt; It already said like this. Let me check.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.470
It will probably Okay. So basically now

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480
It will probably Okay. So basically now

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.030
It will probably Okay. So basically now you specify the menu item that leads to

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040
you specify the menu item that leads to

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.150
you specify the menu item that leads to this particular controller action and

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160
this particular controller action and

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.150
this particular controller action and this particular controller action

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160
this particular controller action

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.789
this particular controller action renders some HTML tweak. Okay. And you

00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799
renders some HTML tweak. Okay. And you

00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:46.470
renders some HTML tweak. Okay. And you don't have

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480
don't have

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.349
don't have &gt;&gt; in place.

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359
&gt;&gt; in place.

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:49.910
&gt;&gt; in place. &gt;&gt; Uh no this is actually because can you

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920
&gt;&gt; Uh no this is actually because can you

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.589
&gt;&gt; Uh no this is actually because can you switch to your controller?

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:56.470
So you either not extend abstract

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480
So you either not extend abstract

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.309
So you either not extend abstract controller or you need to add your

00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319
controller or you need to add your

00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:01.270
controller or you need to add your controller in your service. So in this

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280
controller in your service. So in this

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.190
controller in your service. So in this case for you faster will be to remove

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200
case for you faster will be to remove

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.670
case for you faster will be to remove the fact that it extends this controller

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680
the fact that it extends this controller

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.510
the fact that it extends this controller because you don't need any actions right

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520
because you don't need any actions right

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.150
because you don't need any actions right now from the base class. You we not

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160
now from the base class. You we not

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.230
now from the base class. You we not using it here. So no you don't extend

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240
using it here. So no you don't extend

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.270
using it here. So no you don't extend abstract controller.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280
abstract controller.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.910
abstract controller. Okay. This parent class

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920
Okay. This parent class

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.349
Okay. This parent class forces you to basically register your

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359
forces you to basically register your

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:25.750
forces you to basically register your controller in a DI container in with

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760
controller in a DI container in with

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.190
controller in a DI container in with services yl file. So faster will be just

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200
services yl file. So faster will be just

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.349
services yl file. So faster will be just not extend. Okay, you can actually go

00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359
not extend. Okay, you can actually go

00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:35.990
not extend. Okay, you can actually go the other way around later. So you can

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000
the other way around later. So you can

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.230
the other way around later. So you can okay so this is because it's not finding

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240
okay so this is because it's not finding

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.390
okay so this is because it's not finding the template. So basically it means that

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400
the template. So basically it means that

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.950
the template. So basically it means that routing works controller works just the

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960
routing works controller works just the

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.430
routing works controller works just the template is not in appropriate place.

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440
template is not in appropriate place.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.470
template is not in appropriate place. Can you switch back to IDE because uh I

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480
Can you switch back to IDE because uh I

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.589
Can you switch back to IDE because uh I think yeah so all the templates and this

00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599
think yeah so all the templates and this

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:56.950
think yeah so all the templates and this comes from the symfony

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.150
way

00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160
way

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.109
way &gt;&gt; are always inside resources views.

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119
&gt;&gt; are always inside resources views.

00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:06.309
&gt;&gt; are always inside resources views. &gt;&gt; Okay. So have directory resources views

00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319
&gt;&gt; Okay. So have directory resources views

00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:10.549
&gt;&gt; Okay. So have directory resources views &gt;&gt; with s at the end.

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:12.950
And right now your uh you need to create

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960
And right now your uh you need to create

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.109
And right now your uh you need to create directory that name comes from

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119
directory that name comes from

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:17.430
directory that name comes from controller without controller uh

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440
controller without controller uh

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.109
controller without controller uh postfix. So it will be for you

00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119
postfix. So it will be for you

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:21.670
postfix. So it will be for you usernaming type.

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680
usernaming type.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.589
usernaming type. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Here we have payment term because

00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Here we have payment term because

00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:35.030
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Here we have payment term because we had payment term control

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:45.910
and index html twe

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.470
and this index html tweak just needs to

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480
and this index html tweak just needs to

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.030
and this index html tweak just needs to extend our base index and please take it

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040
extend our base index and please take it

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.870
extend our base index and please take it from some examples. because to be honest

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880
from some examples. because to be honest

00:58:52.880 --> 00:59:04.570
from some examples. because to be honest I don't remember exactly the path

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:14.309
[Music]

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:16.549
uh down lower

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559
uh down lower

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:19.829
uh down lower stop here previous entity index page yes

00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839
stop here previous entity index page yes

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:22.950
stop here previous entity index page yes this index the second link

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960
this index the second link

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.510
this index the second link index template.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520
index template.

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.069
index template. Okay, so you need to extend this one and

00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079
Okay, so you need to extend this one and

00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:29.829
Okay, so you need to extend this one and you also need to have the line number

00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839
you also need to have the line number

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.670
you also need to have the line number three because you need to pass the data

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680
three because you need to pass the data

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.230
three because you need to pass the data grid name to it and parent template will

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240
grid name to it and parent template will

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.829
grid name to it and parent template will handle everything.

00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:39.589
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that you created a grid

00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that you created a grid

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:42.470
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that you created a grid already.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480
already.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:48.190
already. Not sure that created but uh

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200
Not sure that created but uh

00:59:48.200 --> 01:00:03.030
Not sure that created but uh [Music]

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.829
Mhm. And you

01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839
Mhm. And you

01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:10.069
Mhm. And you don't have any ACL yet. So ACL resource

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079
don't have any ACL yet. So ACL resource

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:12.710
don't have any ACL yet. So ACL resource it's also something that will not even

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720
it's also something that will not even

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.270
it's also something that will not even be found. So it will be ignored. it will

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280
be found. So it will be ignored. it will

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.309
be found. So it will be ignored. it will be ignored or it it will block the data

01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319
be ignored or it it will block the data

01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:20.150
be ignored or it it will block the data grid because it doesn't exist.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160
grid because it doesn't exist.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.910
grid because it doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure. Maybe you'll get the

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure. Maybe you'll get the

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.630
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure. Maybe you'll get the error.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640
error.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.670
error. &gt;&gt; You can test

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680
&gt;&gt; You can test

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.910
&gt;&gt; You can test and then for the options you also don't

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920
and then for the options you also don't

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.190
and then for the options you also don't need anything.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.510
Uh so you have title format

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520
Uh so you have title format

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.870
Uh so you have title format you added already sortter and filter. Uh

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880
you added already sortter and filter. Uh

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.630
you added already sortter and filter. Uh okay but sortter column you have label

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640
okay but sortter column you have label

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.710
okay but sortter column you have label we don't have such a field you need to

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720
we don't have such a field you need to

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.349
we don't have such a field you need to in line 24 you need to do the title

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359
in line 24 you need to do the title

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:54.390
in line 24 you need to do the title because we have title and same for 27

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400
because we have title and same for 27

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.109
because we have title and same for 27 and 30 yes and 27 default sorting is by

01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119
and 30 yes and 27 default sorting is by

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:02.309
and 30 yes and 27 default sorting is by label column which we don't have so by

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319
label column which we don't have so by

01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:05.910
label column which we don't have so by title

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.589
yeah here is the column name and write

01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599
yeah here is the column name and write

01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:14.230
yeah here is the column name and write is which sorter Okay,

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:29.829
looks correct.

01:01:29.839 --> 01:01:31.109
Cash.

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119
Cash.

01:01:31.119 --> 01:03:41.430
Cash. &gt;&gt; Can you click cash just to be sure?

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.630
It shows something. And what

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640
It shows something. And what

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.510
It shows something. And what and what was the

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520
and what was the

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.950
and what was the additional

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.510
optional task?

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520
optional task?

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.630
optional task? uh to display the format uh column using

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640
uh to display the format uh column using

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.190
uh to display the format uh column using custom template because right now your

01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200
custom template because right now your

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.029
custom template because right now your format column just consists of uh

01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039
format column just consists of uh

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.309
format column just consists of uh value for it. Right.

01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319
value for it. Right.

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:04.789
value for it. Right. &gt;&gt; Right.

01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.950
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And there is a way to display it by

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960
&gt;&gt; And there is a way to display it by

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.549
&gt;&gt; And there is a way to display it by custom

01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559
custom

01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:10.390
custom um

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400
um

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.789
um &gt;&gt; and what should be custom? It's like the

01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799
&gt;&gt; and what should be custom? It's like the

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:14.309
&gt;&gt; and what should be custom? It's like the ID and then the same

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319
ID and then the same

01:04:14.319 --> 01:04:17.109
ID and then the same &gt;&gt; you can for me you can put there

01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119
&gt;&gt; you can for me you can put there

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.870
&gt;&gt; you can for me you can put there anything you want.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880
anything you want.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So yeah, I just want you to

01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:24.069
&gt;&gt; Okay. So yeah, I just want you to practice how to do this and what exactly

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079
practice how to do this and what exactly

01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:27.190
practice how to do this and what exactly will be in your tweak up to you.

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200
will be in your tweak up to you.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:27.750
will be in your tweak up to you. &gt;&gt; Okay.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.829
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And how to do it, you can find on the

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839
&gt;&gt; And how to do it, you can find on the

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:31.990
&gt;&gt; And how to do it, you can find on the slides. Uh

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000
slides. Uh

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.309
slides. Uh you have example on the theory slides.

01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319
you have example on the theory slides.

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:36.230
you have example on the theory slides. If you can switch back so I will show

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240
If you can switch back so I will show

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.789
If you can switch back so I will show you where is the example how to do it

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799
you where is the example how to do it

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:44.470
you where is the example how to do it on the data grid slide.

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480
on the data grid slide.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.029
on the data grid slide. Um

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039
Um

01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:49.750
Um here on configuration of data grid yes

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760
here on configuration of data grid yes

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.150
here on configuration of data grid yes tweak type colon. Okay. So instead of

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160
tweak type colon. Okay. So instead of

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.190
tweak type colon. Okay. So instead of putting uh just a label you also need to

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200
putting uh just a label you also need to

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.710
putting uh just a label you also need to type tweak front end type HTML and path

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720
type tweak front end type HTML and path

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.109
type tweak front end type HTML and path to your custom tweak template you can

01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119
to your custom tweak template you can

01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:03.349
to your custom tweak template you can pick what this template how this

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359
pick what this template how this

01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:06.309
pick what this template how this template looks uh in a course

01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319
template looks uh in a course

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:10.710
template looks uh in a course &gt;&gt; right it's in columns.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.510
So the question for this this twe so

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520
So the question for this this twe so

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.789
So the question for this this twe so actually I'm not sure how so this way

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799
actually I'm not sure how so this way

01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:18.470
actually I'm not sure how so this way I'm not sure referred to I take it

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480
I'm not sure referred to I take it

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.029
I'm not sure referred to I take it automatically but the question is so and

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039
automatically but the question is so and

01:05:21.039 --> 01:05:23.270
automatically but the question is so and previous part I have the same issue with

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280
previous part I have the same issue with

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.230
previous part I have the same issue with this three for the listener because it

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240
this three for the listener because it

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.630
this three for the listener because it was not finding it

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640
was not finding it

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.710
was not finding it &gt;&gt; so it needs to be also in resources

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720
&gt;&gt; so it needs to be also in resources

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.630
&gt;&gt; so it needs to be also in resources views always and then you have this

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640
views always and then you have this

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:40.390
views always and then you have this symfony at notation to for the paths

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400
symfony at notation to for the paths

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.670
symfony at notation to for the paths Okay, let let me put it there.

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680
Okay, let let me put it there.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:53.270
Okay, let let me put it there. Uh, we have format sign.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.109
&gt;&gt; The label was okay. Actually,

01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119
&gt;&gt; The label was okay. Actually,

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.829
&gt;&gt; The label was okay. Actually, &gt;&gt; that there is a label as well.

01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839
&gt;&gt; that there is a label as well.

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.589
&gt;&gt; that there is a label as well. &gt;&gt; You always have a label because you need

01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599
&gt;&gt; You always have a label because you need

01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:04.150
&gt;&gt; You always have a label because you need to specify the heer for the column. So,

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160
to specify the heer for the column. So,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:04.870
to specify the heer for the column. So, label.

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880
label.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.950
label. &gt;&gt; This part is not clear to me. So, I'm

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960
&gt;&gt; This part is not clear to me. So, I'm

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.349
&gt;&gt; This part is not clear to me. So, I'm using the U. So it's it should be

01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359
using the U. So it's it should be

01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:11.829
using the U. So it's it should be something like uh naming

01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839
something like uh naming

01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:15.270
something like uh naming &gt;&gt; training usernaming. So this is always

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280
&gt;&gt; training usernaming. So this is always

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.910
&gt;&gt; training usernaming. So this is always namespace plus a bundle name but without

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920
namespace plus a bundle name but without

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.630
namespace plus a bundle name but without a bundle postfix. Why it's called like

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640
a bundle postfix. Why it's called like

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.349
a bundle postfix. Why it's called like this? You can go and ask symphony

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359
this? You can go and ask symphony

01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:26.630
this? You can go and ask symphony because that's their rule. Uh so it's

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640
because that's their rule. Uh so it's

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.109
because that's their rule. Uh so it's always this and usernaming without the

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119
always this and usernaming without the

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:32.309
always this and usernaming without the bundle. And then the last the the rest

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319
bundle. And then the last the the rest

01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:34.789
bundle. And then the last the the rest it's actually the path relative to what

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799
it's actually the path relative to what

01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:38.710
it's actually the path relative to what you have inside resources views.

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720
you have inside resources views.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.349
you have inside resources views. Yes, without

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359
Yes, without

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:44.390
Yes, without &gt;&gt; and this at training usernaming gives

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400
&gt;&gt; and this at training usernaming gives

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.190
&gt;&gt; and this at training usernaming gives you the entrance to resources views

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200
you the entrance to resources views

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:54.390
you the entrance to resources views inside your

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.270
&gt;&gt; actually I think I can put the data grid

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280
&gt;&gt; actually I think I can put the data grid

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.150
&gt;&gt; actually I think I can put the data grid as well.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160
as well.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.510
as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That it's probably

01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That it's probably

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That it's probably good idea because this is just a path to

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280
good idea because this is just a path to

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.150
good idea because this is just a path to resources views and then you have some

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160
resources views and then you have some

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.990
resources views and then you have some data grid elements.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000
data grid elements.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.109
data grid elements. Yeah, under the column it's Yeah, now

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119
Yeah, under the column it's Yeah, now

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:13.670
Yeah, under the column it's Yeah, now you have you can check in the

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680
you have you can check in the

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.510
you have you can check in the &gt;&gt; Yeah, let me check

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me check

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.789
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me check &gt;&gt; but I can also tell you that uh in all

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799
&gt;&gt; but I can also tell you that uh in all

01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:22.950
&gt;&gt; but I can also tell you that uh in all those templates that goes to the

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960
those templates that goes to the

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.589
those templates that goes to the um data grid cells you have always two

01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599
um data grid cells you have always two

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:28.870
um data grid cells you have always two variables inside. One is value and this

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880
variables inside. One is value and this

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.750
variables inside. One is value and this will give you just the cell value and

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760
will give you just the cell value and

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.150
will give you just the cell value and second is record which will give you the

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160
second is record which will give you the

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.069
second is record which will give you the whole row.

01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079
whole row.

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:39.029
whole row. So if you just want to display

01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039
So if you just want to display

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:44.230
So if you just want to display uh value then

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.510
so here you have

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520
so here you have

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.069
so here you have but you don't need any link I think this

01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079
but you don't need any link I think this

01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:54.230
but you don't need any link I think this example it's way too complicated.

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240
example it's way too complicated.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:09.349
example it's way too complicated. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah but it put me on

01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:11.670
using macros. I'm not sure what this

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680
using macros. I'm not sure what this

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.950
using macros. I'm not sure what this macro is doing.

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960
macro is doing.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.870
macro is doing. &gt;&gt; You're importing another tweak because

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880
&gt;&gt; You're importing another tweak because

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.030
&gt;&gt; You're importing another tweak because later below in the next line you're uh

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040
later below in the next line you're uh

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.950
later below in the next line you're uh using the method from this macro which

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960
using the method from this macro which

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.789
using the method from this macro which is called entity view link. You don't

01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799
is called entity view link. You don't

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:23.669
is called entity view link. You don't need anything like this here. So again

01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679
need anything like this here. So again

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:27.030
need anything like this here. So again here you have two variables value which

01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040
here you have two variables value which

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.910
here you have two variables value which is the value of the cell and then record

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920
is the value of the cell and then record

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.390
is the value of the cell and then record which is the whole row. So you have two

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400
which is the whole row. So you have two

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.309
which is the whole row. So you have two variables and you can basically display

01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319
variables and you can basically display

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:51.430
variables and you can basically display anything from them.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.590
attribute will try to fetch the format

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600
attribute will try to fetch the format

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.349
attribute will try to fetch the format from the value and value is already

01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359
from the value and value is already

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.470
from the value and value is already uh plainfield.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480
uh plainfield.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.709
uh plainfield. So you cannot use attribute method on

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719
So you cannot use attribute method on

01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:05.110
So you cannot use attribute method on the value because it's a plain field.

01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120
the value because it's a plain field.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.269
the value because it's a plain field. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:10.550
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; But so you want to use record. So you

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560
&gt;&gt; But so you want to use record. So you

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.430
&gt;&gt; But so you want to use record. So you have two variables value and record.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440
have two variables value and record.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.910
have two variables value and record. uh record and on the record you have

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920
uh record and on the record you have

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.309
uh record and on the record you have this get value method. Uh I will send

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319
this get value method. Uh I will send

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.269
this get value method. Uh I will send you some example maybe because it's hard

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279
you some example maybe because it's hard

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.950
you some example maybe because it's hard to

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960
to

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.269
to without sharing a screen to show you

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.389
record

01:09:32.389 --> 01:09:32.399
record

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.630
record [Music]

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640
[Music]

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.189
[Music] get value.

01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:49.749
Okay.

01:09:49.759 --> 01:09:52.550
This is maybe too complicated

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560
This is maybe too complicated

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.990
This is maybe too complicated example but yeah why not.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000
example but yeah why not.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.470
example but yeah why not. So basically the idea is that all in all

01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480
So basically the idea is that all in all

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.430
So basically the idea is that all in all those templates you have two

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440
those templates you have two

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.390
those templates you have two uh variables. First you can just echo

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400
uh variables. First you can just echo

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.470
uh variables. First you can just echo value and this will do exactly the same

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480
value and this will do exactly the same

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.790
value and this will do exactly the same as if you don't have any template

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800
as if you don't have any template

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.630
as if you don't have any template because this will just display the value

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640
because this will just display the value

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.590
because this will just display the value of the cell but uh second you have also

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600
of the cell but uh second you have also

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.390
of the cell but uh second you have also this record on which you can do the get

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400
this record on which you can do the get

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.669
this record on which you can do the get value and the record is your whole row.

01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679
value and the record is your whole row.

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:24.149
value and the record is your whole row. So here I can also get the value of the

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159
So here I can also get the value of the

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:27.350
So here I can also get the value of the ID or title because we're supposed to be

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360
ID or title because we're supposed to be

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.110
ID or title because we're supposed to be in the format column. Okay. So this is

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120
in the format column. Okay. So this is

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.189
in the format column. Okay. So this is how you get any value from your row and

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199
how you get any value from your row and

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:39.280
how you get any value from your row and this is the cell value. Basically this

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:51.590
[Music]

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.189
I'm getting this value and then getting

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199
I'm getting this value and then getting

01:10:55.199 --> 01:11:02.870
I'm getting this value and then getting the format done.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.350
&gt;&gt; A format value you have actually under

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360
&gt;&gt; A format value you have actually under

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.070
&gt;&gt; A format value you have actually under the main value uh because we are inside

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080
the main value uh because we are inside

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.600
the main value uh because we are inside the format uh row. Mhm.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:13.610
the format uh row. Mhm.

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:26.390
the format uh row. Mhm. [Music]

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:59.830
Okay, that changes in

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.229
like this.

01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239
like this.

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:04.630
like this. And then the question, what was wrong

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640
And then the question, what was wrong

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.390
And then the question, what was wrong with this one? Uh

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400
with this one? Uh

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.830
with this one? Uh it was

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.470
listener it's under folder but however

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480
listener it's under folder but however

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.030
listener it's under folder but however it works. Um

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040
it works. Um

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.110
it works. Um &gt;&gt; the path was incorrect here. Again you

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120
&gt;&gt; the path was incorrect here. Again you

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.030
&gt;&gt; the path was incorrect here. Again you need to use this notation. So first

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040
need to use this notation. So first

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.430
need to use this notation. So first start it with at

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440
start it with at

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.550
start it with at and then type training usernaming

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560
and then type training usernaming

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.790
and then type training usernaming and then everything that is related to

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800
and then everything that is related to

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.709
and then everything that is related to resources view

01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719
resources view

01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:33.350
resources view &gt;&gt; and how I should refer to the resources

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360
&gt;&gt; and how I should refer to the resources

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.590
&gt;&gt; and how I should refer to the resources which in the template or I cannot do

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600
which in the template or I cannot do

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.590
which in the template or I cannot do this

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600
this

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.470
this I mean I have this templates and then I

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480
I mean I have this templates and then I

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.030
I mean I have this templates and then I try to

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040
try to

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.950
try to &gt;&gt; but you don't put it here why you put it

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960
&gt;&gt; but you don't put it here why you put it

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.270
&gt;&gt; but you don't put it here why you put it outside of the bundle you stick into

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280
outside of the bundle you stick into

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.270
outside of the bundle you stick into your bundle then it will be even easier

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280
your bundle then it will be even easier

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.470
your bundle then it will be even easier to move the

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480
to move the

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:48.950
to move the &gt;&gt; right

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960
&gt;&gt; right

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.390
&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; functionality always

01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400
&gt;&gt; functionality always

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.590
&gt;&gt; functionality always &gt;&gt; as far understood. Yeah, I probably

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600
&gt;&gt; as far understood. Yeah, I probably

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.830
&gt;&gt; as far understood. Yeah, I probably there is some general templates like we

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840
there is some general templates like we

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.550
there is some general templates like we can use.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560
can use.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.070
can use. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the general templates

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the general templates

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the general templates directory but you want to use it only if

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000
directory but you want to use it only if

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.990
directory but you want to use it only if you would like to override some

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000
you would like to override some

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.990
you would like to override some templates from the vendors,

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000
templates from the vendors,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.590
templates from the vendors, &gt;&gt; right? So you cannot go to the vendor

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600
&gt;&gt; right? So you cannot go to the vendor

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.229
&gt;&gt; right? So you cannot go to the vendor file and just edit it there because it

01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239
file and just edit it there because it

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:10.229
file and just edit it there because it will be overrided on every composer

01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239
will be overrided on every composer

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:14.149
will be overrided on every composer install. Uh but uh that's why we have

01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159
install. Uh but uh that's why we have

01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:16.149
install. Uh but uh that's why we have this global templates and then here you

01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159
this global templates and then here you

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:18.550
this global templates and then here you can override core.

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560
can override core.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.030
can override core. By the way, how it will happen if I will

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040
By the way, how it will happen if I will

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.070
By the way, how it will happen if I will have this bundle actually it's front

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080
have this bundle actually it's front

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.669
have this bundle actually it's front naming of the bundle but uh if I don't

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679
naming of the bundle but uh if I don't

01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:30.390
naming of the bundle but uh if I don't have the template within my bundle but I

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400
have the template within my bundle but I

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.950
have the template within my bundle but I have it in template will it take it or

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960
have it in template will it take it or

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.870
have it in template will it take it or not?

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880
not?

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.790
not? &gt;&gt; It will first look uh for it inside this

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800
&gt;&gt; It will first look uh for it inside this

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.350
&gt;&gt; It will first look uh for it inside this global templates directory and then it

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360
global templates directory and then it

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.350
global templates directory and then it looks always in your bundles.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360
looks always in your bundles.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.390
looks always in your bundles. &gt;&gt; So it's fine if I will rename just uh

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400
&gt;&gt; So it's fine if I will rename just uh

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.189
&gt;&gt; So it's fine if I will rename just uh this one. Not really because this is

01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199
this one. Not really because this is

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:51.430
this one. Not really because this is your custom code. So try to keep your

01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440
your custom code. So try to keep your

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.229
your custom code. So try to keep your custom code in your SRC.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239
custom code in your SRC.

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:56.149
custom code in your SRC. So from the point of view, yes, it will

01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159
So from the point of view, yes, it will

01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:58.630
So from the point of view, yes, it will work. But from the

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640
work. But from the

01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.910
work. But from the &gt;&gt; right yeah I mean

01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920
&gt;&gt; right yeah I mean

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.070
&gt;&gt; right yeah I mean &gt;&gt; yeah yeah from this point of view yes

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah from this point of view yes

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.870
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah from this point of view yes this should work but still

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880
this should work but still

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.310
this should work but still &gt;&gt; yeah just checking. So and there is no

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320
&gt;&gt; yeah just checking. So and there is no

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.270
&gt;&gt; yeah just checking. So and there is no way and there is no way. So if I will

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280
way and there is no way. So if I will

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.550
way and there is no way. So if I will want to take this one can I specify it

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560
want to take this one can I specify it

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.149
want to take this one can I specify it in the string somehow?

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159
in the string somehow?

01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:24.149
in the string somehow? like bas without anything.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:27.750
&gt;&gt; I mean if I want to take this one, can I

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760
&gt;&gt; I mean if I want to take this one, can I

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.950
&gt;&gt; I mean if I want to take this one, can I put it like this one?

01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960
put it like this one?

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.030
put it like this one? &gt;&gt; Uh yes.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.270
&gt;&gt; This base HTML tweak it probably have

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280
&gt;&gt; This base HTML tweak it probably have

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.870
&gt;&gt; This base HTML tweak it probably have some double columns before it. We using

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880
some double columns before it. We using

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.270
some double columns before it. We using it in some places. So I can check how to

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280
it in some places. So I can check how to

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.510
it in some places. So I can check how to reach this file

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520
reach this file

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.310
reach this file base but base HTML quickly it's loads

01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320
base but base HTML quickly it's loads

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.790
base but base HTML quickly it's loads your whole page. So you probably get

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800
your whole page. So you probably get

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:59.800
your whole page. So you probably get some infinite loop or something.

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:10.149
[Music]

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:13.270
I'm not really sure how to reach the

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280
I'm not really sure how to reach the

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.510
I'm not really sure how to reach the tweak file

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520
tweak file

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.550
tweak file here.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.790
&gt;&gt; It was not clear for me with this event.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800
&gt;&gt; It was not clear for me with this event.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.950
&gt;&gt; It was not clear for me with this event. So tried to use this events. I didn't

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960
So tried to use this events. I didn't

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.709
So tried to use this events. I didn't find this events at all. So the

01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719
find this events at all. So the

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:27.350
find this events at all. So the scrolling events I tried to find it

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360
scrolling events I tried to find it

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.270
scrolling events I tried to find it within the events but

01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280
within the events but

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.910
within the events but but I didn't find the event I have

01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920
but I didn't find the event I have

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.630
but I didn't find the event I have specific there within the events.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.950
Not sure what you're asking for where

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960
Not sure what you're asking for where

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.950
Not sure what you're asking for where you wanted to

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960
you wanted to

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.630
you wanted to &gt;&gt; find the events.

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640
&gt;&gt; find the events.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.750
&gt;&gt; find the events. The event is uh dispatched by core

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760
The event is uh dispatched by core

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:57.030
The event is uh dispatched by core bundles.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.950
So if you want to find out where the

01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960
So if you want to find out where the

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.870
So if you want to find out where the events are dispatched then it will be

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880
events are dispatched then it will be

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.149
events are dispatched then it will be somewhere in our UI.

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159
somewhere in our UI.

01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:13.220
somewhere in our UI. &gt;&gt; I found the way in the code where the

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:21.669
[Music]

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:25.030
I'm not sure what this one is.

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040
I'm not sure what this one is.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.350
I'm not sure what this one is. &gt;&gt; This is the index html page that

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360
&gt;&gt; This is the index html page that

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.390
&gt;&gt; This is the index html page that &gt;&gt; Okay, it's for controller, right?

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:39.030
Let's

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.510
have it like this.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:17:19.030
And let's remove this one.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.430
Yeah, it worked.

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440
Yeah, it worked.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.750
Yeah, it worked. However, so my question was about the

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760
However, so my question was about the

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.110
However, so my question was about the event was like and try to open this one

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120
event was like and try to open this one

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.630
event was like and try to open this one and then uh this event is working for

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640
and then uh this event is working for

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.470
and then uh this event is working for the

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.590
should I specific head yeah there. So

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600
should I specific head yeah there. So

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.510
should I specific head yeah there. So it's working for this

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.110
on update this one for this

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120
on update this one for this

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.149
on update this one for this event.

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159
event.

01:17:52.159 --> 01:17:52.870
event. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.590
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; However, I cannot find this event there

01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600
&gt;&gt; However, I cannot find this event there

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.460
&gt;&gt; However, I cannot find this event there within the event.

01:17:58.460 --> 01:17:58.470
within the event.

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:02.149
within the event. [Music]

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:04.550
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to search for it. It doesn't

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to search for it. It doesn't

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.350
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to search for it. It doesn't look when I'm trying to scroll down to

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360
look when I'm trying to scroll down to

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.750
look when I'm trying to scroll down to find at least something.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760
find at least something.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.030
find at least something. So this will be UI event and it's called

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040
So this will be UI event and it's called

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.870
So this will be UI event and it's called onscroll data or something like that.

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880
onscroll data or something like that.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.110
onscroll data or something like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm not sure is it the bug

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm not sure is it the bug

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm not sure is it the bug from my site or not but it's it's never

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360
from my site or not but it's it's never

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.390
from my site or not but it's it's never ending this

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400
ending this

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.950
ending this element with the same

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960
element with the same

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.669
element with the same calls

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:37.430
debug vault. It's like it's

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.390
always checking if you can see this. So

01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400
always checking if you can see this. So

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.110
always checking if you can see this. So it will be

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120
it will be

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.030
it will be loading and loading. No.

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040
loading and loading. No.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.270
loading and loading. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's loading. Yeah. And so I'm

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's loading. Yeah. And so I'm

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's loading. Yeah. And so I'm trying to find at least something but at

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080
trying to find at least something but at

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.149
trying to find at least something but at least u but it's it's not looking for

01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159
least u but it's it's not looking for

01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:56.070
least u but it's it's not looking for this as well. So I can only see the

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080
this as well. So I can only see the

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.270
this as well. So I can only see the kernel request de kernel controller

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280
kernel request de kernel controller

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.510
kernel request de kernel controller de and so on and then it's about 10 of

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520
de and so on and then it's about 10 of

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.430
de and so on and then it's about 10 of them. It's not much of this events at

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440
them. It's not much of this events at

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.149
them. It's not much of this events at all.

01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159
all.

01:19:10.159 --> 01:19:12.070
all. &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm not sure how to find

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080
&gt;&gt; So that's why I'm not sure how to find

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.990
&gt;&gt; So that's why I'm not sure how to find this event which I'm trying to use.

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000
this event which I'm trying to use.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.510
this event which I'm trying to use. &gt;&gt; Okay. So um let me share my screen. I

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. So um let me share my screen. I

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.190
&gt;&gt; Okay. So um let me share my screen. I will this show you this again.

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:24.200
will this show you this again.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.550
will this show you this again. [Music]

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560
[Music]

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.990
[Music] two and

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000
two and

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.470
two and this was on the first.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.110
So the idea behind this is that every

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120
So the idea behind this is that every

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.310
So the idea behind this is that every our every page in the back office of

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320
our every page in the back office of

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.270
our every page in the back office of course is uh dispatching some event and

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280
course is uh dispatching some event and

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.310
course is uh dispatching some event and this event always starts from this what

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320
this event always starts from this what

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.990
this event always starts from this what you found. Um let me open this

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000
you found. Um let me open this

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.830
you found. Um let me open this here.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.830
If you dig in deeper and go uh to the

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840
If you dig in deeper and go uh to the

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.390
If you dig in deeper and go uh to the index page for example and so on, you'll

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400
index page for example and so on, you'll

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.470
index page for example and so on, you'll see that later somewhere there there is

01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480
see that later somewhere there there is

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.550
see that later somewhere there there is this event dispatch and it always starts

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560
this event dispatch and it always starts

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.630
this event dispatch and it always starts with this or scroll data before.

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:16.640
with this or scroll data before.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.950
with this or scroll data before. &gt;&gt; Mhm. I I found it right.

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I I found it right.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.669
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I I found it right. &gt;&gt; Mhm. I'm not sure if it will be instant

01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I'm not sure if it will be instant

01:20:21.679 --> 01:20:23.510
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I'm not sure if it will be instant toolbar. I can check on my site in a

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520
toolbar. I can check on my site in a

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:29.430
toolbar. I can check on my site in a moment. Uh but basically

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.030
uh yes. So

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040
uh yes. So

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.870
uh yes. So this is our bundle. This is extension

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880
this is our bundle. This is extension

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.390
this is our bundle. This is extension and it's always when rendering data it's

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400
and it's always when rendering data it's

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.229
and it's always when rendering data it's always dispatching this particular

01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239
always dispatching this particular

01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:45.510
always dispatching this particular event. Okay. And page identifier you can

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520
event. Okay. And page identifier you can

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.229
event. Okay. And page identifier you can uh check it uh because this will be the

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239
uh check it uh because this will be the

01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:50.310
uh check it uh because this will be the ID parameter that is passed to the data

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320
ID parameter that is passed to the data

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.510
ID parameter that is passed to the data block uh on our templates. So if I open

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520
block uh on our templates. So if I open

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.870
block uh on our templates. So if I open any

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.510
uh HTML tweak

01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520
uh HTML tweak

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.270
uh HTML tweak let's say for business unit

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280
let's say for business unit

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.030
let's say for business unit maybe not good example

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040
maybe not good example

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.350
maybe not good example okay

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360
okay

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.870
okay user

01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880
user

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.520
user bundle

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:15.530
bundle

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:17.750
bundle [Music]

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760
[Music]

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:30.630
[Music] this

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.350
I'm not in the correct place. Just give

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360
I'm not in the correct place. Just give

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.910
I'm not in the correct place. Just give me a second.

01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920
me a second.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:45.510
me a second. Platform. This is user.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.990
Okay.

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000
Okay.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.590
Okay. Okay. So let's say view action

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600
Okay. So let's say view action

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.270
Okay. So let's say view action because we were supposed to add

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280
because we were supposed to add

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.189
because we were supposed to add something to the user view page. So this

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199
something to the user view page. So this

01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:57.270
something to the user view page. So this is the template that is rendering the

01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280
is the template that is rendering the

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.270
is the template that is rendering the user view page, the back office user

01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280
user view page, the back office user

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.270
user view page, the back office user view page. And here in the content data

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280
view page. And here in the content data

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.149
view page. And here in the content data block we are passing some ID and then

01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159
block we are passing some ID and then

01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:10.870
block we are passing some ID and then later in the parent template this I data

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880
later in the parent template this I data

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.350
later in the parent template this I data f is passed up and up and up and at the

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360
f is passed up and up and up and at the

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.070
f is passed up and up and up and at the end it gets to this extension and we're

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080
end it gets to this extension and we're

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.229
end it gets to this extension and we're executing we're dispatching um event

01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239
executing we're dispatching um event

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:22.310
executing we're dispatching um event like this before dot and this will be

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320
like this before dot and this will be

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.189
like this before dot and this will be this ID. So if you want to add something

01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199
this ID. So if you want to add something

01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:27.510
this ID. So if you want to add something to this particular page, you need to

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520
to this particular page, you need to

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.870
to this particular page, you need to create a listener that will listen to

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880
create a listener that will listen to

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.830
create a listener that will listen to uh ori scroll data before dot and then

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840
uh ori scroll data before dot and then

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.629
uh ori scroll data before dot and then just check the identifier of your page

01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639
just check the identifier of your page

01:22:36.639 --> 01:22:39.910
just check the identifier of your page and this is what will happen. This is

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920
and this is what will happen. This is

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.510
and this is what will happen. This is how you can get it from here.

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520
how you can get it from here.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.669
how you can get it from here. &gt;&gt; I can check in a moment on my site uh

01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679
&gt;&gt; I can check in a moment on my site uh

01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:47.189
&gt;&gt; I can check in a moment on my site uh later if I will have it in events in the

01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199
later if I will have it in events in the

01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:49.830
later if I will have it in events in the symfony toolbar

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840
symfony toolbar

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.629
symfony toolbar but I'm not sure if it will be there.

01:22:54.639 --> 01:22:56.550
Maybe I'll have the same scroll issue as

01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560
Maybe I'll have the same scroll issue as

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.430
Maybe I'll have the same scroll issue as you. So, normally when I want to do

01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440
you. So, normally when I want to do

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.270
you. So, normally when I want to do something like this, I'm going to the

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280
something like this, I'm going to the

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.270
something like this, I'm going to the template that I want to inject something

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280
template that I want to inject something

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.709
template that I want to inject something to check.

01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719
to check.

01:23:06.719 --> 01:23:08.950
to check. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was more general question if I

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was more general question if I

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was more general question if I want to find the exact event. But yeah,

01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320
want to find the exact event. But yeah,

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.310
want to find the exact event. But yeah, so far I can see it's not always work

01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320
so far I can see it's not always work

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.030
so far I can see it's not always work this book tools. But yeah, any case,

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040
this book tools. But yeah, any case,

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:25.030
this book tools. But yeah, any case, thanks for explanation.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.950
check my toolbar actually

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:57.430
just because I'm curious.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.950
It's not finding it for me either

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960
It's not finding it for me either

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.830
It's not finding it for me either in here.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840
in here.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.229
in here. &gt;&gt; For me that was an edit page but in any

01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239
&gt;&gt; For me that was an edit page but in any

01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:08.870
&gt;&gt; For me that was an edit page but in any case you see I can see that the set of

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880
case you see I can see that the set of

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:19.110
case you see I can see that the set of them is also not big for you.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.189
This is actually a tweak function. Maybe

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199
This is actually a tweak function. Maybe

01:24:21.199 --> 01:24:23.750
This is actually a tweak function. Maybe safar is not noticing dispatching this

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760
safar is not noticing dispatching this

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.270
safar is not noticing dispatching this event.

01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280
event.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.830
event. &gt;&gt; That's what I thought. So some some some

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840
&gt;&gt; That's what I thought. So some some some

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.830
&gt;&gt; That's what I thought. So some some some actions which happens on the front end

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840
actions which happens on the front end

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.270
actions which happens on the front end is not getting there at all.

01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280
is not getting there at all.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.030
is not getting there at all. &gt;&gt; Because this is basically with tweak

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040
&gt;&gt; Because this is basically with tweak

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.470
&gt;&gt; Because this is basically with tweak extension and we're just executing this

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480
extension and we're just executing this

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.070
extension and we're just executing this tweak

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080
tweak

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.830
tweak function and inside it's uh

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840
function and inside it's uh

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.350
function and inside it's uh dispatching this event. So,

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.830
okay

01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840
okay

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.110
okay guys, any questions from

01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120
guys, any questions from

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.629
guys, any questions from others?

01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639
others?

01:24:56.639 --> 01:25:03.430
others? How is what's the status on your site?

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:10.870
Uh take admir

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.149
um was there any particular

01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159
um was there any particular

01:25:14.159 --> 01:25:15.510
um was there any particular thing we should do in the custom

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520
thing we should do in the custom

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.030
thing we should do in the custom template on this optional or was it just

01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040
template on this optional or was it just

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.830
template on this optional or was it just to should can we just display the value?

01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840
to should can we just display the value?

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.669
to should can we just display the value? Oh I see you had a little example

01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679
Oh I see you had a little example

01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:23.830
Oh I see you had a little example &gt;&gt; display the value make it bold make it

01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840
&gt;&gt; display the value make it bold make it

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.149
&gt;&gt; display the value make it bold make it red whatever just for you to know how to

01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159
red whatever just for you to know how to

01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:28.390
red whatever just for you to know how to put HTML tweak templates there.

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400
put HTML tweak templates there.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.590
put HTML tweak templates there. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Okay.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Okay.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.189
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So for this example it doesn't

01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So for this example it doesn't

01:25:31.199 --> 01:25:33.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So for this example it doesn't matter for me but we use it for example

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120
matter for me but we use it for example

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.590
matter for me but we use it for example when we have the yes no value instead of

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600
when we have the yes no value instead of

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.750
when we have the yes no value instead of displaying zero one or something weird

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760
displaying zero one or something weird

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.470
displaying zero one or something weird we display nice uh icons right so in

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480
we display nice uh icons right so in

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.750
we display nice uh icons right so in this case you will use the tweick

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760
this case you will use the tweick

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.910
this case you will use the tweick template and just display based on the

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920
template and just display based on the

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.510
template and just display based on the value display nice tick or x

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520
value display nice tick or x

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.070
value display nice tick or x &gt;&gt; okay

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.550
&gt;&gt; okay so is it okay on your site do you

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560
&gt;&gt; okay so is it okay on your site do you

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.390
&gt;&gt; okay so is it okay on your site do you have does that agreed with index page

01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400
have does that agreed with index page

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.870
have does that agreed with index page Yes.

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880
Yes.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.629
Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt; Okay. What about you?

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040
What about you?

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.189
What about you? &gt;&gt; Um, yes, I finished this part. I had a

01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199
&gt;&gt; Um, yes, I finished this part. I had a

01:26:09.199 --> 01:26:11.750
&gt;&gt; Um, yes, I finished this part. I had a lot of issues with translations. I'd say

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760
lot of issues with translations. I'd say

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:19.110
lot of issues with translations. I'd say it's quite magic magical. Um, yeah,

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120
it's quite magic magical. Um, yeah,

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.310
it's quite magic magical. Um, yeah, it's hard to to sometimes it's not

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320
it's hard to to sometimes it's not

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.070
it's hard to to sometimes it's not obvious where the values should be

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080
obvious where the values should be

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.990
obvious where the values should be placed and how to to get to bind it

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000
placed and how to to get to bind it

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.310
placed and how to to get to bind it correctly with the data grid. Um,

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320
correctly with the data grid. Um,

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.390
correctly with the data grid. Um, &gt;&gt; do you have any particular question?

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400
&gt;&gt; do you have any particular question?

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.189
&gt;&gt; do you have any particular question? Maybe I can explain this.

01:26:39.199 --> 01:26:46.260
One second.

01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:47.510
[Music]

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520
[Music]

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:59.590
[Music] Let me share my screen.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.990
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen?

01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.950
&gt;&gt; Do you see my screen? &gt;&gt; Almost. Yes.

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960
&gt;&gt; Almost. Yes.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.510
&gt;&gt; Almost. Yes. Um so

01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520
Um so

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.270
Um so um

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280
um

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.669
um when I uh when I worked on this grid uh

01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679
when I uh when I worked on this grid uh

01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:18.149
when I uh when I worked on this grid uh sometimes I had messages in the here in

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159
sometimes I had messages in the here in

01:27:18.159 --> 01:27:20.229
sometimes I had messages in the here in the translation section so that some

01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239
the translation section so that some

01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:23.830
the translation section so that some parts are not translated like this one

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840
parts are not translated like this one

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.189
parts are not translated like this one or

01:27:27.199 --> 01:27:30.790
and uh

01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800
and uh

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.030
and uh if I go to that to messages is it also

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040
if I go to that to messages is it also

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.470
if I go to that to messages is it also requested me to translate this one

01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480
requested me to translate this one

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.149
requested me to translate this one though I don't use it anywhere

01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159
though I don't use it anywhere

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:45.110
though I don't use it anywhere uh it just said that should be

01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120
uh it just said that should be

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.590
uh it just said that should be translated

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600
translated

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.229
translated &gt;&gt; so this actually comes from the grid

01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239
&gt;&gt; so this actually comes from the grid

01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:52.550
&gt;&gt; so this actually comes from the grid because we have this uh functionality on

01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560
because we have this uh functionality on

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.510
because we have this uh functionality on the grid that we are able to specify the

01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520
the grid that we are able to specify the

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.189
the grid that we are able to specify the view

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199
view

01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:59.110
view okay remember I have shown you when

01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120
okay remember I have shown you when

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.629
okay remember I have shown you when showing data grids on this uh uh contact

01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639
showing data grids on this uh uh contact

01:28:02.639 --> 01:28:03.430
showing data grids on this uh uh contact grid

01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440
grid

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.709
grid there were where contacts uh from like

01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719
there were where contacts uh from like

01:28:06.719 --> 01:28:09.669
there were where contacts uh from like all contacts view at the top left of the

01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679
all contacts view at the top left of the

01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:13.030
all contacts view at the top left of the data grid there is the this drop list uh

01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040
data grid there is the this drop list uh

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.709
data grid there is the this drop list uh where you can specify that you want to

01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719
where you can specify that you want to

01:28:14.719 --> 01:28:17.590
where you can specify that you want to see the all view or you can also for

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600
see the all view or you can also for

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.669
see the all view or you can also for example filter this grid by some filter

01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679
example filter this grid by some filter

01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:24.629
example filter this grid by some filter and save this view. Uh yeah this is

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639
and save this view. Uh yeah this is

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:26.550
and save this view. Uh yeah this is exactly this all usernaming type drop

01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560
exactly this all usernaming type drop

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.990
exactly this all usernaming type drop list that you have below there

01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000
list that you have below there

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.149
list that you have below there and you can now for example filter the

01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159
and you can now for example filter the

01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:34.790
and you can now for example filter the greet by title something

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800
greet by title something

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.070
greet by title something &gt;&gt; here here

01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080
&gt;&gt; here here

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.629
&gt;&gt; here here &gt;&gt; yes so you are able and this is out of

01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639
&gt;&gt; yes so you are able and this is out of

01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:42.070
&gt;&gt; yes so you are able and this is out of the box uh functionality of the data

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080
the box uh functionality of the data

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.350
the box uh functionality of the data grid that is loaded automatically until

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360
grid that is loaded automatically until

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.430
grid that is loaded automatically until you say that you don't want it. Okay. So

01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440
you say that you don't want it. Okay. So

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.910
you say that you don't want it. Okay. So you can disable showing this for the

01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920
you can disable showing this for the

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.669
you can disable showing this for the data grid. But out of the box if you do

01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679
data grid. But out of the box if you do

01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:53.830
data grid. But out of the box if you do nothing this will be here because uh

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840
nothing this will be here because uh

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.750
nothing this will be here because uh this is this nice option that now you

01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760
this is this nice option that now you

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.390
this is this nice option that now you can for example filter this grid by

01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400
can for example filter this grid by

01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.990
can for example filter this grid by title

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000
title

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.870
title &gt;&gt; something and then save this particular

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880
&gt;&gt; something and then save this particular

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.590
&gt;&gt; something and then save this particular view. So later on you can come to this

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600
view. So later on you can come to this

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.229
view. So later on you can come to this page and just switch the view and only

01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239
page and just switch the view and only

01:29:08.239 --> 01:29:10.229
page and just switch the view and only have like I've shown you the context

01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239
have like I've shown you the context

01:29:10.239 --> 01:29:12.870
have like I've shown you the context from some particular state. Right? So

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880
from some particular state. Right? So

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.430
from some particular state. Right? So this is this functionality of be

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440
this is this functionality of be

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.950
this is this functionality of be building prefiltered views of your data

01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960
building prefiltered views of your data

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.550
building prefiltered views of your data grid.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also the question all these labels

01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also the question all these labels

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also the question all these labels when I when we put this path um it tries

01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840
when I when we put this path um it tries

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.550
when I when we put this path um it tries to to search it in the messages list.

01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560
to to search it in the messages list.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.350
to to search it in the messages list. Correct.

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360
Correct.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.590
Correct. &gt;&gt; Mhm. And if its translation is not found

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600
&gt;&gt; Mhm. And if its translation is not found

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.870
&gt;&gt; Mhm. And if its translation is not found then it's displaying the whole key.

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880
then it's displaying the whole key.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.030
then it's displaying the whole key. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh there is also in the system

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040
&gt;&gt; Okay. And uh there is also in the system

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. And uh there is also in the system there is a translations grid.

01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320
there is a translations grid.

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.070
there is a translations grid. &gt;&gt; U what's the relation between this grid

01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080
&gt;&gt; U what's the relation between this grid

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.149
&gt;&gt; U what's the relation between this grid and that

01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159
and that

01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:55.110
and that &gt;&gt; so first you have everything in a file

01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120
&gt;&gt; so first you have everything in a file

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.470
&gt;&gt; so first you have everything in a file and uh it is loaded from the file uh

01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480
and uh it is loaded from the file uh

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.590
and uh it is loaded from the file uh then later your client can come here and

01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600
then later your client can come here and

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.750
then later your client can come here and change it from the UI. But you need to

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760
change it from the UI. But you need to

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.990
change it from the UI. But you need to remember that whenever somebody changed

01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000
remember that whenever somebody changed

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.870
remember that whenever somebody changed something from the UI then that this is

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880
something from the UI then that this is

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.350
something from the UI then that this is higher priority. So later on you will

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360
higher priority. So later on you will

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.270
higher priority. So later on you will not be able to update this value from

01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280
not be able to update this value from

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.750
not be able to update this value from the file anymore. So in the translation

01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760
the file anymore. So in the translation

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.270
the file anymore. So in the translation files in the YAML file you have the

01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280
files in the YAML file you have the

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.830
files in the YAML file you have the initial values and prefer preferably

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840
initial values and prefer preferably

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.110
initial values and prefer preferably always all the values. Uh but yeah there

01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120
always all the values. Uh but yeah there

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.990
always all the values. Uh but yeah there is an option to check it here also to

01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000
is an option to check it here also to

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.750
is an option to check it here also to translate it but to be honest we mostly

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760
translate it but to be honest we mostly

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.709
translate it but to be honest we mostly use it to check what's the translation

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719
use it to check what's the translation

01:30:30.719 --> 01:30:32.709
use it to check what's the translation on the page.

01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719
on the page.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.950
on the page. It's always best to have everything in

01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960
It's always best to have everything in

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.550
It's always best to have everything in files.

01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560
files.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.550
files. &gt;&gt; So you can check it change it from here.

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560
&gt;&gt; So you can check it change it from here.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.870
&gt;&gt; So you can check it change it from here. But remember that once you overwrite it

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880
But remember that once you overwrite it

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.629
But remember that once you overwrite it but from the UI you will not be able to

01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639
but from the UI you will not be able to

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:48.709
but from the UI you will not be able to like specify it edit it. I mean if you

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719
like specify it edit it. I mean if you

01:30:48.719 --> 01:30:51.110
like specify it edit it. I mean if you edit YAML file in code it will not not

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120
edit YAML file in code it will not not

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.830
edit YAML file in code it will not not take you will not see result right

01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840
take you will not see result right

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.910
take you will not see result right always what is changed from the UI is

01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920
always what is changed from the UI is

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.669
always what is changed from the UI is more important. Uh so example I don't

01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679
more important. Uh so example I don't

01:30:59.679 --> 01:31:03.189
more important. Uh so example I don't see my my

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199
see my my

01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:05.510
see my my uh my fields

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520
uh my fields

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:05.990
uh my fields &gt;&gt; and

01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000
&gt;&gt; and

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.310
&gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; in this grid is it fine or how how can I

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320
&gt;&gt; in this grid is it fine or how how can I

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.500
&gt;&gt; in this grid is it fine or how how can I add this um

01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:20.790
[Music]

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:32.470
no

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:38.930
You should have it here.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:47.030
[Music]

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.830
that you don't want to have it there.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:32:06.790
I will double check on my site, but

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.350
&gt;&gt; username type something.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.350
Hm.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.830
I searched for usernaming type and I

01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840
I searched for usernaming type and I

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.830
I searched for usernaming type and I have everything.

01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840
have everything.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.470
have everything. Let's try searching just by training.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.070
Yeah,

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080
Yeah,

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.550
Yeah, not really sure. Maybe you can execute

01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560
not really sure. Maybe you can execute

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:32.950
not really sure. Maybe you can execute the load translation command because uh

01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960
the load translation command because uh

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.350
the load translation command because uh probably that's something just cached or

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360
probably that's something just cached or

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.350
probably that's something just cached or not regenerated because I see

01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360
not regenerated because I see

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.590
not regenerated because I see everything. So you should see it too.

01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600
everything. So you should see it too.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.750
everything. So you should see it too. And the comment will be something like

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760
And the comment will be something like

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.550
And the comment will be something like uh translations

01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560
uh translations

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:51.030
uh translations we have or translation load.

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040
we have or translation load.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.550
we have or translation load. Okay, we have this comment

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560
Okay, we have this comment

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.390
Okay, we have this comment copy

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400
copy

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.270
copy this one or translation

01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280
this one or translation

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.430
this one or translation load. So if you can just in console of

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440
load. So if you can just in console of

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.229
load. So if you can just in console of course.

01:33:08.239 --> 01:33:17.830
Okay. Can you check for

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:21.270
the auto complete working?

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280
the auto complete working?

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.669
the auto complete working? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So probably just something was not

01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So probably just something was not

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:29.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So probably just something was not generated properly.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's quite logical that it's not

01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's quite logical that it's not

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's quite logical that it's not loaded automatically because I put it

01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000
loaded automatically because I put it

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.550
loaded automatically because I put it into files but not loaded

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560
into files but not loaded

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.910
into files but not loaded &gt;&gt; in dev mode. uh when I added do any

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920
&gt;&gt; in dev mode. uh when I added do any

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.189
&gt;&gt; in dev mode. uh when I added do any change on messages yl file it's loading

01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199
change on messages yl file it's loading

01:33:43.199 --> 01:33:47.750
change on messages yl file it's loading it's there right so it in def mode it

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760
it's there right so it in def mode it

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.070
it's there right so it in def mode it should be loaded it should not be like

01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080
should be loaded it should not be like

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.430
should be loaded it should not be like cached but some from time to time it

01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440
cached but some from time to time it

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.669
cached but some from time to time it happens that it just gets stuck at some

01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679
happens that it just gets stuck at some

01:33:55.679 --> 01:34:32.149
happens that it just gets stuck at some point and you need to manually force

01:34:32.159 --> 01:34:34.950
Okay, it looks like something wrong in

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960
Okay, it looks like something wrong in

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.709
Okay, it looks like something wrong in my configuration.

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719
my configuration.

01:34:36.719 --> 01:34:39.110
my configuration. It doesn't load automatically. Okay, but

01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120
It doesn't load automatically. Okay, but

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.830
It doesn't load automatically. Okay, but I've got the idea of these translations.

01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840
I've got the idea of these translations.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.030
I've got the idea of these translations. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yep.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.830
&gt;&gt; Okay. Are all the other parts okay on

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. Are all the other parts okay on

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.390
&gt;&gt; Okay. Are all the other parts okay on your side

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400
your side

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.910
your side the index because you asked about

01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920
the index because you asked about

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.750
the index because you asked about translation but yeah I actually saw that

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760
translation but yeah I actually saw that

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.709
translation but yeah I actually saw that you have data agree and all this uh okay

01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719
you have data agree and all this uh okay

01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:03.189
you have data agree and all this uh okay guys so basically

01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199
guys so basically

01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:05.189
guys so basically you all finished

01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199
you all finished

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.910
you all finished the practice right so let's do the break

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920
the practice right so let's do the break

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.149
the practice right so let's do the break and we'll start with next topic let's do

01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159
and we'll start with next topic let's do

01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:23.590
and we'll start with next topic let's do 12 minutes break back 20 plus my four

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.870
Okay guys, uh please let me know if you

01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880
Okay guys, uh please let me know if you

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.870
Okay guys, uh please let me know if you are here.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:37.990
I will share my screen.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:54.310
Okay.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.310
Okay. So our next topic uh and actually

01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320
Okay. So our next topic uh and actually

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.149
Okay. So our next topic uh and actually the only theory topic for today it's

01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159
the only theory topic for today it's

01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:05.189
the only theory topic for today it's going to be about the whole uh entity

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199
going to be about the whole uh entity

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:07.910
going to be about the whole uh entity validation and search. So we stopped at

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920
validation and search. So we stopped at

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.950
validation and search. So we stopped at creating entity then we added index page

01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960
creating entity then we added index page

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.390
creating entity then we added index page and then actually we need to do

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400
and then actually we need to do

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.270
and then actually we need to do something more with it and this will be

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280
something more with it and this will be

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.669
something more with it and this will be the whole um so how to

01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679
the whole um so how to

01:36:19.679 --> 01:36:23.990
the whole um so how to uh create it in auro uh

01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000
uh create it in auro uh

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.629
uh create it in auro uh I'm sure you all know what crat is so

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639
I'm sure you all know what crat is so

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:29.270
I'm sure you all know what crat is so let's uh proceed

01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280
let's uh proceed

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.590
let's uh proceed uh so for the view page this is a read

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600
uh so for the view page this is a read

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.910
uh so for the view page this is a read so to display a view page of entity we

01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920
so to display a view page of entity we

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.750
so to display a view page of entity we need to fetch fetch this entity and then

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760
need to fetch fetch this entity and then

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.870
need to fetch fetch this entity and then display it right. Uh so normally just

01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880
display it right. Uh so normally just

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.910
display it right. Uh so normally just somewhere in the PHP service to fetch

01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920
somewhere in the PHP service to fetch

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.470
somewhere in the PHP service to fetch entity uh from the database we use

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480
entity uh from the database we use

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.510
entity uh from the database we use repository for this and then uh there is

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520
repository for this and then uh there is

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:55.510
repository for this and then uh there is this find or find one by or any other of

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520
this find or find one by or any other of

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.030
this find or find one by or any other of those methods that you can use to

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040
those methods that you can use to

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.990
those methods that you can use to retrieve your entity from the database.

01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000
retrieve your entity from the database.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.709
retrieve your entity from the database. Uh so normally if you'd like to do it in

01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719
Uh so normally if you'd like to do it in

01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:06.310
Uh so normally if you'd like to do it in any PHP class

01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320
any PHP class

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.470
any PHP class uh you would get just repository for

01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480
uh you would get just repository for

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.030
uh you would get just repository for your particular entity and then try to

01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040
your particular entity and then try to

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.950
your particular entity and then try to find one by some parameter.

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960
find one by some parameter.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.629
find one by some parameter. Uh for the controller we actually

01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639
Uh for the controller we actually

01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:21.830
Uh for the controller we actually we're not doing this.

01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840
we're not doing this.

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.870
we're not doing this. Uh for the controller we create view

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880
Uh for the controller we create view

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.189
Uh for the controller we create view action for first and then inside this

01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199
action for first and then inside this

01:37:27.199 --> 01:37:31.270
action for first and then inside this view action.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.629
uh we use uh symfony param converter to

01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639
uh we use uh symfony param converter to

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:37.109
uh we use uh symfony param converter to help us to fetch the entity because for

01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119
help us to fetch the entity because for

01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:39.030
help us to fetch the entity because for the view action

01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040
the view action

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.350
the view action the only thing you need to do is to have

01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360
the only thing you need to do is to have

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.709
the only thing you need to do is to have the proper type hinting and uh

01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719
the proper type hinting and uh

01:37:44.719 --> 01:37:47.510
the proper type hinting and uh Stephanopar converter will basically by

01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520
Stephanopar converter will basically by

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.270
Stephanopar converter will basically by the type of the variable here we'll

01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280
the type of the variable here we'll

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:56.149
the type of the variable here we'll fetch this particular entity by its ID

01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159
fetch this particular entity by its ID

01:37:56.159 --> 01:37:58.390
fetch this particular entity by its ID and ID is passed as a parameter in the

01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400
and ID is passed as a parameter in the

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.270
and ID is passed as a parameter in the URL and we'll fetch this entity from

01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280
URL and we'll fetch this entity from

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.229
URL and we'll fetch this entity from database for us and put it under this

01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239
database for us and put it under this

01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:06.229
database for us and put it under this variable. So we'll be just able to use

01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239
variable. So we'll be just able to use

01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:08.790
variable. So we'll be just able to use it for the view action in Oro. All you

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800
it for the view action in Oro. All you

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.709
it for the view action in Oro. All you need to return is basically this entity

01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719
need to return is basically this entity

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:12.950
need to return is basically this entity variable that will be filled with your

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960
variable that will be filled with your

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.149
variable that will be filled with your entity that you want to view.

01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159
entity that you want to view.

01:38:16.159 --> 01:38:19.830
entity that you want to view. Uh the route annotation here you'll see

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840
Uh the route annotation here you'll see

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.830
Uh the route annotation here you'll see that in all our actions we have the same

01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840
that in all our actions we have the same

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.990
that in all our actions we have the same um uh routes. So for index it was always

01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000
um uh routes. So for index it was always

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.870
um uh routes. So for index it was always just a slash and then for view we always

01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880
just a slash and then for view we always

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.750
just a slash and then for view we always put view and then the ID parameter.

01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760
put view and then the ID parameter.

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.070
put view and then the ID parameter. Okay. So we need to pass in the URL the

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080
Okay. So we need to pass in the URL the

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.270
Okay. So we need to pass in the URL the ID of the entity that we want to view.

01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280
ID of the entity that we want to view.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.910
ID of the entity that we want to view. Uh again this root needs to have a name.

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920
Uh again this root needs to have a name.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.669
Uh again this root needs to have a name. This name needs to be unique. So you'll

01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679
This name needs to be unique. So you'll

01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:46.149
This name needs to be unique. So you'll see this convention uh in all our

01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159
see this convention uh in all our

01:38:46.159 --> 01:38:48.229
see this convention uh in all our controllers that for example for the

01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239
controllers that for example for the

01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:50.790
controllers that for example for the payment term entity we have routes like

01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800
payment term entity we have routes like

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.870
payment term entity we have routes like oral payment term index for the index

01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880
oral payment term index for the index

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.950
oral payment term index for the index then or payment term view for the view

01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960
then or payment term view for the view

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.510
then or payment term view for the view and so on and so on. Additionally here

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520
and so on and so on. Additionally here

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.910
and so on and so on. Additionally here because this ID is supposed to be a

01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920
because this ID is supposed to be a

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.229
because this ID is supposed to be a number decimal, you can add some

01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239
number decimal, you can add some

01:39:02.239 --> 01:39:04.629
number decimal, you can add some additional requirements

01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639
additional requirements

01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:08.149
additional requirements um for this parameter

01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159
um for this parameter

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:11.510
um for this parameter and the template the same as we had for

01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520
and the template the same as we had for

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.629
and the template the same as we had for the index. Uh it will look inside

01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639
the index. Uh it will look inside

01:39:14.639 --> 01:39:17.830
the index. Uh it will look inside resources views then payment turn

01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840
resources views then payment turn

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.830
resources views then payment turn directory based on the controller name

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840
directory based on the controller name

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.070
directory based on the controller name and then view HTML tweak. Okay. So if

01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080
and then view HTML tweak. Okay. So if

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:27.350
and then view HTML tweak. Okay. So if you don't pass any path here, it will

01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360
you don't pass any path here, it will

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.590
you don't pass any path here, it will automatically try to find this template

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600
automatically try to find this template

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.109
automatically try to find this template inside resources views payments term uh

01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119
inside resources views payments term uh

01:39:33.119 --> 01:39:37.990
inside resources views payments term uh view html tweak

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.669
uh okay and simple example of this uh

01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679
uh okay and simple example of this uh

01:39:41.679 --> 01:39:44.629
uh okay and simple example of this uh view page.

01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639
view page.

01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:46.870
view page. So the view page let's check the

01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880
So the view page let's check the

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.870
So the view page let's check the contacts

01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880
contacts

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.030
contacts for example.

01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040
for example.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.350
for example. The view page uh normally consists of

01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360
The view page uh normally consists of

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.109
The view page uh normally consists of some elements like here we have

01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119
some elements like here we have

01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:57.990
some elements like here we have breadcrumbs here we have heather with

01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000
breadcrumbs here we have heather with

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.830
breadcrumbs here we have heather with also kind of bread breadcrumbish thing.

01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840
also kind of bread breadcrumbish thing.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.229
also kind of bread breadcrumbish thing. Uh then we have some additional

01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239
Uh then we have some additional

01:40:04.239 --> 01:40:06.149
Uh then we have some additional information those are called called

01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159
information those are called called

01:40:06.159 --> 01:40:09.430
information those are called called stats. Here we have buttons and here we

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440
stats. Here we have buttons and here we

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.830
stats. Here we have buttons and here we basically have the whole content. So our

01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840
basically have the whole content. So our

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.390
basically have the whole content. So our view uh template actually consists of

01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400
view uh template actually consists of

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.950
view uh template actually consists of those elements uh of those blocks. For

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960
those elements uh of those blocks. For

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.109
those elements uh of those blocks. For the view template, we also have the base

01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119
the view template, we also have the base

01:40:21.119 --> 01:40:23.750
the view template, we also have the base template uh

01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760
template uh

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.550
template uh that you can extend. And for this

01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560
that you can extend. And for this

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.189
that you can extend. And for this template, you just need to pass uh some

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199
template, you just need to pass uh some

01:40:29.199 --> 01:40:30.950
template, you just need to pass uh some variables. Most of all, you need to pass

01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960
variables. Most of all, you need to pass

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.189
variables. Most of all, you need to pass the data that you want to um display.

01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199
the data that you want to um display.

01:40:35.199 --> 01:40:37.510
the data that you want to um display. Uh okay. So, what uh blocks we have

01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520
Uh okay. So, what uh blocks we have

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.990
Uh okay. So, what uh blocks we have here? Actually, not all of them that are

01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000
here? Actually, not all of them that are

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.750
here? Actually, not all of them that are here. Uh but for example, we have a

01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760
here. Uh but for example, we have a

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.550
here. Uh but for example, we have a block uh stats.

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560
block uh stats.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.350
block uh stats. And this is for payment term it's empty

01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360
And this is for payment term it's empty

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.070
And this is for payment term it's empty stats block it's this one which has

01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080
stats block it's this one which has

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.990
stats block it's this one which has created at and so on. So for the

01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000
created at and so on. So for the

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.070
created at and so on. So for the uh payment terms

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.550
we don't have the stats block here

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560
we don't have the stats block here

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.510
we don't have the stats block here because we just emptied it. Okay. Then

01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520
because we just emptied it. Okay. Then

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.109
because we just emptied it. Okay. Then we have page heer and page heer uh kind

01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119
we have page heer and page heer uh kind

01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:12.070
we have page heer and page heer uh kind of have a breadcrumb too. page header is

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080
of have a breadcrumb too. page header is

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.790
of have a breadcrumb too. page header is actually this p this part but as you can

01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800
actually this p this part but as you can

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.510
actually this p this part but as you can see it's also has a link to main page so

01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520
see it's also has a link to main page so

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.990
see it's also has a link to main page so it's kind of

01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000
it's kind of

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:26.950
it's kind of heer plus a little bit breadcrumb thing

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.070
okay

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:33.189
and the most important part for us this

01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199
and the most important part for us this

01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:36.390
and the most important part for us this will be the content data block

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400
will be the content data block

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.709
will be the content data block and content data block displays all this

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719
and content data block displays all this

01:41:40.719 --> 01:41:42.629
and content data block displays all this here all this content which is divided

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639
here all this content which is divided

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:45.189
here all this content which is divided on blocks and blocks can have sub

01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199
on blocks and blocks can have sub

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:49.669
on blocks and blocks can have sub blocks. Uh so how to pass this part? Uh

01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679
blocks. Uh so how to pass this part? Uh

01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:52.870
blocks. Uh so how to pass this part? Uh so inside content data you need to say

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880
so inside content data you need to say

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.950
so inside content data you need to say what you want to display and pass it

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960
what you want to display and pass it

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.470
what you want to display and pass it into the data uh variable and data

01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480
into the data uh variable and data

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.790
into the data uh variable and data variable has all the blocks under the

01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800
variable has all the blocks under the

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.109
variable has all the blocks under the data blocks variable. So actually here

01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119
data blocks variable. So actually here

01:42:03.119 --> 01:42:05.270
data blocks variable. So actually here you want to pass all the blocks that

01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280
you want to pass all the blocks that

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:07.350
you want to pass all the blocks that with sub blocks that you want to be

01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360
with sub blocks that you want to be

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.870
with sub blocks that you want to be displayed.

01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880
displayed.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.030
displayed. Uh of course you need to give this page

01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040
Uh of course you need to give this page

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.830
Uh of course you need to give this page some identifier for this uh scroll data

01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840
some identifier for this uh scroll data

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.709
some identifier for this uh scroll data event and call parent. So our parent

01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719
event and call parent. So our parent

01:42:16.719 --> 01:42:19.189
event and call parent. So our parent template will take all those information

01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199
template will take all those information

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:21.109
template will take all those information and render the page for you based on

01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119
and render the page for you based on

01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:23.990
and render the page for you based on those information. How to define data

01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000
those information. How to define data

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.990
those information. How to define data blocks? As you can see here, this is a

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000
blocks? As you can see here, this is a

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.750
blocks? As you can see here, this is a payment term which is very simple

01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760
payment term which is very simple

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.030
payment term which is very simple because we have basically one block

01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040
because we have basically one block

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.270
because we have basically one block um view page sorry view page uh one

01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280
um view page sorry view page uh one

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.149
um view page sorry view page uh one block with

01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159
block with

01:42:38.159 --> 01:42:40.790
block with general information

01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800
general information

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.950
general information uh and then this activity part is

01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960
uh and then this activity part is

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.350
uh and then this activity part is actually added by activity bundle. Okay.

01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360
actually added by activity bundle. Okay.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.510
actually added by activity bundle. Okay. So in the original payment term view

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520
So in the original payment term view

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.149
So in the original payment term view page we'll just have the uh general

01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159
page we'll just have the uh general

01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:52.629
page we'll just have the uh general information block. And to render the

01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639
information block. And to render the

01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:56.629
information block. And to render the general information block um

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639
general information block um

01:42:56.639 --> 01:42:58.229
general information block um our data blocks because we can have

01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239
our data blocks because we can have

01:42:58.239 --> 01:42:59.750
our data blocks because we can have multiple.

01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760
multiple.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.669
multiple. So we can have multiple instances of

01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679
So we can have multiple instances of

01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:04.229
So we can have multiple instances of this one and each block because this is

01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239
this one and each block because this is

01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:06.390
this one and each block because this is block. If I had a second one then here

01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400
block. If I had a second one then here

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.030
block. If I had a second one then here below this I will have

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040
below this I will have

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.830
below this I will have another element like this and this block

01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840
another element like this and this block

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.910
another element like this and this block has a title. Title goes to this what we

01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920
has a title. Title goes to this what we

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.910
has a title. Title goes to this what we have

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920
have

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.310
have here. So general information is the

01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320
here. So general information is the

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.709
here. So general information is the title of my blog. Then we can also

01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719
title of my blog. Then we can also

01:43:22.719 --> 01:43:26.229
title of my blog. Then we can also specify if on the page load uh it should

01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239
specify if on the page load uh it should

01:43:26.239 --> 01:43:29.109
specify if on the page load uh it should be active block or not

01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119
be active block or not

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:31.830
be active block or not and this block can contain one or

01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840
and this block can contain one or

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.950
and this block can contain one or multiple sublocks. Okay, that's why here

01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960
multiple sublocks. Okay, that's why here

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.590
multiple sublocks. Okay, that's why here we have only one entrance but I can

01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600
we have only one entrance but I can

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.990
we have only one entrance but I can actually have multiple lines like this

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000
actually have multiple lines like this

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.189
actually have multiple lines like this and specify data for each sub block. In

01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199
and specify data for each sub block. In

01:43:43.199 --> 01:43:45.590
and specify data for each sub block. In this first sub block, we render this

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600
this first sub block, we render this

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.830
this first sub block, we render this data. And this is basically just some

01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840
data. And this is basically just some

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.590
data. And this is basically just some tweak variable that was filled with

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600
tweak variable that was filled with

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.149
tweak variable that was filled with HTML. Um here with using some specific

01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159
HTML. Um here with using some specific

01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:56.950
HTML. Um here with using some specific oro widget render. Uh but this can be

01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960
oro widget render. Uh but this can be

01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.709
oro widget render. Uh but this can be also done just normally.

01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719
also done just normally.

01:44:00.719 --> 01:44:05.109
also done just normally. Uh I hope this is

01:44:05.119 --> 01:44:07.350
another example.

01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360
another example.

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.790
another example. Oh, like here. Okay. So into the task

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800
Oh, like here. Okay. So into the task

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.790
Oh, like here. Okay. So into the task information variable, we're just

01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800
information variable, we're just

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.750
information variable, we're just basically rendering some HTML

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760
basically rendering some HTML

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.070
basically rendering some HTML by specifying HTML or by using some

01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080
by specifying HTML or by using some

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.669
by specifying HTML or by using some existing

01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679
existing

01:44:21.679 --> 01:44:25.830
existing um methods. Uh so in our or UI bundle

01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840
um methods. Uh so in our or UI bundle

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.990
um methods. Uh so in our or UI bundle and in some other bundles, you will find

01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000
and in some other bundles, you will find

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.470
and in some other bundles, you will find that we have some tweak macros defined

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480
that we have some tweak macros defined

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.510
that we have some tweak macros defined for you. And this UI macros here they

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520
for you. And this UI macros here they

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.910
for you. And this UI macros here they consist a lot of really nice helper

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920
consist a lot of really nice helper

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.950
consist a lot of really nice helper methods like how to render property uh

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960
methods like how to render property uh

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.750
methods like how to render property uh render some button and so on. You can

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760
render some button and so on. You can

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.950
render some button and so on. You can later check what we have there. Uh so

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960
later check what we have there. Uh so

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.510
later check what we have there. Uh so for us the important is just to render

01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520
for us the important is just to render

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.750
for us the important is just to render property because this is usually what we

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760
property because this is usually what we

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.990
property because this is usually what we have uh here. So to render the property

01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000
have uh here. So to render the property

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.990
have uh here. So to render the property this way that we have in the back

01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000
this way that we have in the back

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.030
this way that we have in the back office. So this part on the left gets

01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040
office. So this part on the left gets

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.830
office. So this part on the left gets some appropriate its appropriate element

01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840
some appropriate its appropriate element

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.950
some appropriate its appropriate element and it will be styled exactly this way.

01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960
and it will be styled exactly this way.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.350
and it will be styled exactly this way. You can import this Oro UI

01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360
You can import this Oro UI

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.990
You can import this Oro UI and use render property method. First

01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000
and use render property method. First

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.950
and use render property method. First parameter is a label. Second parameter

01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960
parameter is a label. Second parameter

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.990
parameter is a label. Second parameter is a value and for the label also you

01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000
is a value and for the label also you

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.709
is a value and for the label also you can use translations.

01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719
can use translations.

01:45:20.719 --> 01:45:25.510
can use translations. Uh so once you rendered this HTML

01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520
Uh so once you rendered this HTML

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.189
Uh so once you rendered this HTML to this variable you basically put it

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199
to this variable you basically put it

01:45:29.199 --> 01:45:34.149
to this variable you basically put it into super block. Okay. So this is same

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159
into super block. Okay. So this is same

01:45:34.159 --> 01:45:37.590
into super block. Okay. So this is same thing.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.189
Okay.

01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199
Okay.

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:41.270
Okay. Uh and then what to do if you'd like to

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280
Uh and then what to do if you'd like to

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:45.109
Uh and then what to do if you'd like to render a grid.

01:45:45.119 --> 01:45:47.830
So to render a greet

01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840
So to render a greet

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.510
So to render a greet um

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520
um

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.070
um we have a macro for you.

01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080
we have a macro for you.

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.990
we have a macro for you. Uh so you don't need to uh kind of guess

01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000
Uh so you don't need to uh kind of guess

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.870
Uh so you don't need to uh kind of guess how to render it. Uh just import our

01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880
how to render it. Uh just import our

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.070
how to render it. Uh just import our macro and our data grid macro has a

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080
macro and our data grid macro has a

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.470
macro and our data grid macro has a method called render grid and this

01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480
method called render grid and this

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.310
method called render grid and this method

01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320
method

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.550
method uh all you need to do it pass is pass

01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560
uh all you need to do it pass is pass

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.709
uh all you need to do it pass is pass the grid name there. Okay. And this will

01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719
the grid name there. Okay. And this will

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:13.830
the grid name there. Okay. And this will be enough. This will render your grid.

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840
be enough. This will render your grid.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.990
be enough. This will render your grid. Uh so what we are doing here we'll

01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000
Uh so what we are doing here we'll

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.229
Uh so what we are doing here we'll actually rendering this to some variable

01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239
actually rendering this to some variable

01:46:18.239 --> 01:46:22.629
actually rendering this to some variable and this customer grid is then added to

01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639
and this customer grid is then added to

01:46:22.639 --> 01:46:27.030
and this customer grid is then added to a block called customers as a first s

01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040
a block called customers as a first s

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.669
a block called customers as a first s block. Okay. So this is actually the

01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679
block. Okay. So this is actually the

01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:39.590
block. Okay. So this is actually the customer tax page.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.270
Okay.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.430
So here as you can see we have the

01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440
So here as you can see we have the

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.910
So here as you can see we have the customer block which is empty. This

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920
customer block which is empty. This

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.990
customer block which is empty. This means that this data grid is empty and

01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000
means that this data grid is empty and

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.629
means that this data grid is empty and we have second data grid of all the

01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639
we have second data grid of all the

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:55.350
we have second data grid of all the customer groups that have this tax code

01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360
customer groups that have this tax code

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.350
customer groups that have this tax code assigned. Okay. So we have two data

01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360
assigned. Okay. So we have two data

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.109
assigned. Okay. So we have two data grids and general information and two

01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119
grids and general information and two

01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:05.109
grids and general information and two data grids. So here we have the

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119
data grids. So here we have the

01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:07.990
data grids. So here we have the general information rendered into some

01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000
general information rendered into some

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.790
general information rendered into some variable then added as a block. Then we

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800
variable then added as a block. Then we

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.030
variable then added as a block. Then we have first customer grid and then

01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040
have first customer grid and then

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.430
have first customer grid and then customer group grid and they are both

01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440
customer group grid and they are both

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.070
customer group grid and they are both added as a second and third block.

01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080
added as a second and third block.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.189
added as a second and third block. Uh now what you can do more so there are

01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199
Uh now what you can do more so there are

01:47:23.199 --> 01:47:24.950
Uh now what you can do more so there are some additional parameters like those

01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960
some additional parameters like those

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.669
some additional parameters like those here that you can put uh to render data

01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679
here that you can put uh to render data

01:47:27.679 --> 01:47:31.030
here that you can put uh to render data grid uh pass to render data grid method.

01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040
grid uh pass to render data grid method.

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.830
grid uh pass to render data grid method. Uh so actually in this case we are not

01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840
Uh so actually in this case we are not

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.590
Uh so actually in this case we are not displaying the grid of all the

01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600
displaying the grid of all the

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.070
displaying the grid of all the customers. Okay. because I have plenty

01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080
customers. Okay. because I have plenty

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.709
customers. Okay. because I have plenty of customers here and my data grid is

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719
of customers here and my data grid is

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:43.189
of customers here and my data grid is empty. Why? Because this data grid is

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199
empty. Why? Because this data grid is

01:47:43.199 --> 01:47:45.189
empty. Why? Because this data grid is actually displaying list of customers

01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199
actually displaying list of customers

01:47:45.199 --> 01:47:48.550
actually displaying list of customers but filtered by a wear condition where

01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560
but filtered by a wear condition where

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.590
but filtered by a wear condition where when this customer has this particular

01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600
when this customer has this particular

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.390
when this customer has this particular tax code assigned. So how to do this?

01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400
tax code assigned. So how to do this?

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.629
tax code assigned. So how to do this? How to actually pass some variable

01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639
How to actually pass some variable

01:47:56.639 --> 01:47:59.830
How to actually pass some variable because we need to pass this tax code ID

01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840
because we need to pass this tax code ID

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.870
because we need to pass this tax code ID to our customers greet and use it in the

01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880
to our customers greet and use it in the

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.990
to our customers greet and use it in the wear condition. So how to do this? Uh

01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000
wear condition. So how to do this? Uh

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.910
wear condition. So how to do this? Uh for this we have a second

01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920
for this we have a second

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.669
for this we have a second parameter which is an array of

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679
parameter which is an array of

01:48:11.679 --> 01:48:13.510
parameter which is an array of parameters that you want to pass to data

01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520
parameters that you want to pass to data

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.550
parameters that you want to pass to data grid. Here will be this parameter name

01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560
grid. Here will be this parameter name

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.470
grid. Here will be this parameter name and later by this name you will use it

01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480
and later by this name you will use it

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.629
and later by this name you will use it in your data grid. And here is the

01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639
in your data grid. And here is the

01:48:20.639 --> 01:48:23.270
in your data grid. And here is the value. We are on the view page of our

01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280
value. We are on the view page of our

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.430
value. We are on the view page of our tax code. So we're just basically

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440
tax code. So we're just basically

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.270
tax code. So we're just basically passing ID of our entity. And under this

01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280
passing ID of our entity. And under this

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.990
passing ID of our entity. And under this variable in our grid, we're going to

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000
variable in our grid, we're going to

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.350
variable in our grid, we're going to have this customer tax code ID. Okay, as

01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360
have this customer tax code ID. Okay, as

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.030
have this customer tax code ID. Okay, as you can see as third parameter, you can

01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040
you can see as third parameter, you can

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.229
you can see as third parameter, you can add some CSS class etc.

01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239
add some CSS class etc.

01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:43.109
add some CSS class etc. Uh and now how to use it? So we are

01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119
Uh and now how to use it? So we are

01:48:43.119 --> 01:48:45.590
Uh and now how to use it? So we are passing customer tax code in the

01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600
passing customer tax code in the

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.870
passing customer tax code in the customer tax code ID variable. And let's

01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880
customer tax code ID variable. And let's

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:56.950
customer tax code ID variable. And let's see how this variable is used.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.830
Okay.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.430
So in my grid

01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440
So in my grid

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.470
So in my grid uh in the source section beside the

01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480
uh in the source section beside the

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.629
uh in the source section beside the query I have also bind parameters

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639
query I have also bind parameters

01:49:08.639 --> 01:49:11.350
query I have also bind parameters section. So I need to first say that I

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360
section. So I need to first say that I

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.350
section. So I need to first say that I want to bind this parameter to my data

01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360
want to bind this parameter to my data

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.350
want to bind this parameter to my data grid. And this is the parameter name

01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360
grid. And this is the parameter name

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.910
grid. And this is the parameter name exactly the same that we filled in here

01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920
exactly the same that we filled in here

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.390
exactly the same that we filled in here with some value.

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400
with some value.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.350
with some value. And now I can use this parameter in my

01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360
And now I can use this parameter in my

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.669
And now I can use this parameter in my where statement. So in the query I'm

01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679
where statement. So in the query I'm

01:49:25.679 --> 01:49:29.750
where statement. So in the query I'm adding where and where the tax code on

01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760
adding where and where the tax code on

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:33.669
adding where and where the tax code on our customer entity is equal to this. So

01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679
our customer entity is equal to this. So

01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:37.030
our customer entity is equal to this. So this way we have the customer grid but

01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040
this way we have the customer grid but

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.790
this way we have the customer grid but filtered with this additional work

01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800
filtered with this additional work

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.790
filtered with this additional work condition. So not all the customers but

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800
condition. So not all the customers but

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.550
condition. So not all the customers but only those who have this tax code

01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560
only those who have this tax code

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.550
only those who have this tax code assigned.

01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560
assigned.

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.990
assigned. So binding using

01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000
So binding using

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.550
So binding using and passing.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.750
Okay.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.189
Okay. So, what about next actions? Uh

01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199
Okay. So, what about next actions? Uh

01:49:59.199 --> 01:50:01.750
Okay. So, what about next actions? Uh while explaining create and update, I

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760
while explaining create and update, I

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:05.350
while explaining create and update, I will kind of jump between slides because

01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360
will kind of jump between slides because

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:08.950
will kind of jump between slides because they share a lot of code together. Uh so

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960
they share a lot of code together. Uh so

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.109
they share a lot of code together. Uh so creating and updating is pretty much the

01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119
creating and updating is pretty much the

01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:13.590
creating and updating is pretty much the same. Uh just the difference is where we

01:50:13.590 --> 01:50:13.600
same. Uh just the difference is where we

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.510
same. Uh just the difference is where we start because for create we're creating

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520
start because for create we're creating

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.910
start because for create we're creating new entity and for update we need to

01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920
new entity and for update we need to

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.629
new entity and for update we need to fetch existing entity and then fill it

01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639
fetch existing entity and then fill it

01:50:20.639 --> 01:50:23.430
fetch existing entity and then fill it with some data. Okay. So for the create

01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440
with some data. Okay. So for the create

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.669
with some data. Okay. So for the create you create an object fetch uh fill it

01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679
you create an object fetch uh fill it

01:50:25.679 --> 01:50:29.270
you create an object fetch uh fill it with some data like here set label that

01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280
with some data like here set label that

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:33.590
with some data like here set label that persists this uh this entity and flash

01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600
persists this uh this entity and flash

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.870
persists this uh this entity and flash so save this fact to the database and

01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880
so save this fact to the database and

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.149
so save this fact to the database and normally with a PHP code

01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159
normally with a PHP code

01:50:40.159 --> 01:50:41.750
normally with a PHP code this is exactly this example we're

01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760
this is exactly this example we're

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.990
this is exactly this example we're creating entity filling it filling it

01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000
creating entity filling it filling it

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.270
creating entity filling it filling it with data persisting and flashing for

01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280
with data persisting and flashing for

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.830
with data persisting and flashing for the update this will be uh pretty

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840
the update this will be uh pretty

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.550
the update this will be uh pretty similar just f first we need to fetch

01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560
similar just f first we need to fetch

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:57.669
similar just f first we need to fetch this entity fetch existing entity and

01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679
this entity fetch existing entity and

01:50:57.679 --> 01:50:59.990
this entity fetch existing entity and then modify data right so basically it's

01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000
then modify data right so basically it's

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.030
then modify data right so basically it's pretty much the same what happens in the

01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040
pretty much the same what happens in the

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.629
pretty much the same what happens in the controller

01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639
controller

01:51:04.639 --> 01:51:08.470
controller uh let me close those okay

01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480
uh let me close those okay

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.229
uh let me close those okay uh so for the controller we have two

01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239
uh so for the controller we have two

01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:12.390
uh so for the controller we have two separate actions we have one action for

01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400
separate actions we have one action for

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.750
separate actions we have one action for create and separ second action for

01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760
create and separ second action for

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.950
create and separ second action for update uh for the create the route is

01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960
update uh for the create the route is

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.629
update uh for the create the route is without parameters because we're

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639
without parameters because we're

01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:26.149
without parameters because we're creating new entity.

01:51:26.159 --> 01:51:30.229
Uh so we're going to have a route. Then

01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239
Uh so we're going to have a route. Then

01:51:30.239 --> 01:51:32.709
Uh so we're going to have a route. Then you'll see that our naming convention

01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719
you'll see that our naming convention

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:35.590
you'll see that our naming convention gives us only always create.

01:51:35.590 --> 01:51:35.600
gives us only always create.

01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.149
gives us only always create. We always name it the same way. Then you

01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159
We always name it the same way. Then you

01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:40.550
We always name it the same way. Then you need to put a name to your route. So in

01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560
need to put a name to your route. So in

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.790
need to put a name to your route. So in our case, this is or payment term

01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800
our case, this is or payment term

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.870
our case, this is or payment term create.

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880
create.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.109
create. And inside action, it doesn't have any

01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119
And inside action, it doesn't have any

01:51:47.119 --> 01:51:50.390
And inside action, it doesn't have any uh parameters. And then inside creation

01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400
uh parameters. And then inside creation

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.270
uh parameters. And then inside creation actually the same thing happens as for

01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280
actually the same thing happens as for

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:56.870
actually the same thing happens as for the update the that's why we didn't copy

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880
the update the that's why we didn't copy

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.470
the update the that's why we didn't copy paste the code twice but we divided it

01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480
paste the code twice but we divided it

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.589
paste the code twice but we divided it into separate update method and as you

01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599
into separate update method and as you

01:52:03.599 --> 01:52:06.310
into separate update method and as you can see for the update for the create we

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320
can see for the update for the create we

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.189
can see for the update for the create we use the same piece of code just here

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199
use the same piece of code just here

01:52:09.199 --> 01:52:11.830
use the same piece of code just here we're creating a new payment term so new

01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840
we're creating a new payment term so new

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.709
we're creating a new payment term so new entity and here we are fetching some

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719
entity and here we are fetching some

01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:18.390
entity and here we are fetching some existing one. Okay.

01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400
existing one. Okay.

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:24.149
existing one. Okay. Uh, yep. So basically I will switch jump

01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159
Uh, yep. So basically I will switch jump

01:52:24.159 --> 01:52:30.629
Uh, yep. So basically I will switch jump here. So for the action uh update action

01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639
here. So for the action uh update action

01:52:30.639 --> 01:52:33.510
here. So for the action uh update action uh the route our naming convention is

01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520
uh the route our naming convention is

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.149
uh the route our naming convention is /update and then we need to pass the ID

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159
/update and then we need to pass the ID

01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:37.589
/update and then we need to pass the ID parameter because for update we're

01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599
parameter because for update we're

01:52:37.599 --> 01:52:39.510
parameter because for update we're actually updating existing entity. So we

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520
actually updating existing entity. So we

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.669
actually updating existing entity. So we need to fetch it the same way we fetched

01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679
need to fetch it the same way we fetched

01:52:41.679 --> 01:52:45.589
need to fetch it the same way we fetched it for the view um name. And because

01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599
it for the view um name. And because

01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:47.589
it for the view um name. And because we're passing some parameter, we can

01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599
we're passing some parameter, we can

01:52:47.599 --> 01:52:51.030
we're passing some parameter, we can also add requirements here.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040
also add requirements here.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.870
also add requirements here. Um,

01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880
Um,

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.350
Um, and for the update, similar as we had

01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360
and for the update, similar as we had

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.589
and for the update, similar as we had for the view, we use Symphfony param

01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599
for the view, we use Symphfony param

01:52:57.599 --> 01:53:01.030
for the view, we use Symphfony param converter. We just pass the uh type of

01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040
converter. We just pass the uh type of

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.310
converter. We just pass the uh type of our variable and Symphfony is fetching

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320
our variable and Symphfony is fetching

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.950
our variable and Symphfony is fetching payment term with this particular ID

01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960
payment term with this particular ID

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.870
payment term with this particular ID from the database and saving to this

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880
from the database and saving to this

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.790
from the database and saving to this payment term variable and we can

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800
payment term variable and we can

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.430
payment term variable and we can basically use it.

01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440
basically use it.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.189
basically use it. Um

01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199
Um

01:53:15.199 --> 01:53:18.390
Um second part is a template.

01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400
second part is a template.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.030
second part is a template. So update

01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040
So update

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.470
So update has its own template and create is using

01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480
has its own template and create is using

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.750
has its own template and create is using in our case our create is using update

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760
in our case our create is using update

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:30.390
in our case our create is using update template. Uh why? Because those

01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400
template. Uh why? Because those

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.390
template. Uh why? Because those templates will be actually the same

01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400
templates will be actually the same

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.350
templates will be actually the same because both for create and for update

01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360
because both for create and for update

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.310
because both for create and for update we're rendering a form type.

01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320
we're rendering a form type.

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.950
we're rendering a form type. Just for update we're passing their uh

01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960
Just for update we're passing their uh

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.189
Just for update we're passing their uh not empty entity. So this form will be

01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199
not empty entity. So this form will be

01:53:43.199 --> 01:53:45.270
not empty entity. So this form will be automatically bound with existing

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280
automatically bound with existing

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.870
automatically bound with existing values.

01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880
values.

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.229
values. Uh and we may have just uh so from the

01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239
Uh and we may have just uh so from the

01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:52.870
Uh and we may have just uh so from the tweak point of view we are rendering

01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880
tweak point of view we are rendering

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.830
tweak point of view we are rendering form because binding is happening in the

01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840
form because binding is happening in the

01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.990
form because binding is happening in the background in the PHP code. So from the

01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000
background in the PHP code. So from the

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.910
background in the PHP code. So from the tweak template nothing changes regarding

01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920
tweak template nothing changes regarding

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.629
tweak template nothing changes regarding rendering the form. In both casing cases

01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639
rendering the form. In both casing cases

01:54:02.639 --> 01:54:05.669
rendering the form. In both casing cases we just rendering the form. Uh the only

01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679
we just rendering the form. Uh the only

01:54:05.679 --> 01:54:07.270
we just rendering the form. Uh the only difference will be for example that it

01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280
difference will be for example that it

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.550
difference will be for example that it will be different action uh uh form

01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560
will be different action uh uh form

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:14.229
will be different action uh uh form action or for example for the update we

01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239
action or for example for the update we

01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:16.950
action or for example for the update we will display delete button for create it

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960
will display delete button for create it

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.950
will display delete button for create it doesn't make sense so we don't display

01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960
doesn't make sense so we don't display

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.229
doesn't make sense so we don't display delete button

01:54:24.239 --> 01:54:27.430
yeah and that's why they share template

01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440
yeah and that's why they share template

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.070
yeah and that's why they share template and that's why for the update you see

01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080
and that's why for the update you see

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.709
and that's why for the update you see that we only specify annotation at

01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719
that we only specify annotation at

01:54:32.719 --> 01:54:36.229
that we only specify annotation at template so it will Search for resources

01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239
template so it will Search for resources

01:54:36.239 --> 01:54:39.030
template so it will Search for resources views

01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040
views

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.990
views resources views then payment term

01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000
resources views then payment term

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.830
resources views then payment term and then update HTML tweak and here we

01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840
and then update HTML tweak and here we

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.830
and then update HTML tweak and here we have this template.

01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840
have this template.

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.030
have this template. I will switch to it in a second. But for

01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040
I will switch to it in a second. But for

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:56.149
I will switch to it in a second. But for the create

01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159
the create

01:54:56.159 --> 01:55:02.070
the create it will try to find uh resources views

01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080
it will try to find uh resources views

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.870
it will try to find uh resources views uh then payment term and then create

01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880
uh then payment term and then create

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.430
uh then payment term and then create HTML tweak and this template doesn't

01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440
HTML tweak and this template doesn't

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.830
HTML tweak and this template doesn't exist because we want to reuse reuse

01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840
exist because we want to reuse reuse

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.750
exist because we want to reuse reuse update template. That's why here

01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760
update template. That's why here

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.310
update template. That's why here in the add template annotation we

01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320
in the add template annotation we

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:19.109
in the add template annotation we actually specify the path to the

01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119
actually specify the path to the

01:55:19.119 --> 01:55:22.790
actually specify the path to the template. So using at annotation

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800
template. So using at annotation

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:25.510
template. So using at annotation or payment term and then payment term

01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520
or payment term and then payment term

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.910
or payment term and then payment term update HTML tweak right. So our create

01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920
update HTML tweak right. So our create

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.149
update HTML tweak right. So our create action is using update HTML tweak

01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159
action is using update HTML tweak

01:55:32.159 --> 01:55:35.589
action is using update HTML tweak um template.

01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599
um template.

01:55:35.599 --> 01:55:39.589
um template. Uh this template

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:42.550
basically also have some uh base

01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560
basically also have some uh base

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.870
basically also have some uh base templates that we have in Oro UI. It's

01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880
templates that we have in Oro UI. It's

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:47.830
templates that we have in Oro UI. It's update HTML tweak. uh then we can have

01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840
update HTML tweak. uh then we can have

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.830
update HTML tweak. uh then we can have some buttons and as you can see we are

01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840
some buttons and as you can see we are

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:52.790
some buttons and as you can see we are here

01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800
here

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:54.709
here uh checking for something that is

01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719
uh checking for something that is

01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:58.310
uh checking for something that is granted and I'm actually

01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320
granted and I'm actually

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:08.390
granted and I'm actually looking for difference between

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.990
okay so that's actually the only

01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000
okay so that's actually the only

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.109
okay so that's actually the only difference between uh create and update

01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119
difference between uh create and update

01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:15.830
difference between uh create and update so based on the fact if ID it's there so

01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840
so based on the fact if ID it's there so

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.669
so based on the fact if ID it's there so for creating it will not be there for

01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679
for creating it will not be there for

01:56:17.679 --> 01:56:19.750
for creating it will not be there for updating it will be there. We will have

01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760
updating it will be there. We will have

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.950
updating it will be there. We will have different form action and that's it. The

01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960
different form action and that's it. The

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.709
different form action and that's it. The rest is the same. We display some

01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719
rest is the same. We display some

01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:27.990
rest is the same. We display some buttons and hi there and in our content

01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000
buttons and hi there and in our content

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.030
buttons and hi there and in our content data we are displaying

01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040
data we are displaying

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.990
data we are displaying one row. Yay. That's payment term.

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000
one row. Yay. That's payment term.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.070
one row. Yay. That's payment term. That's why it's so simple.

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:47.430
Okay. Let's go to create one row. uh

01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440
Okay. Let's go to create one row. uh

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.950
Okay. Let's go to create one row. uh sorry and form errors

01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960
sorry and form errors

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.390
sorry and form errors and that's it.

01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400
and that's it.

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.550
and that's it. Uh then let's go back to our controller.

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560
Uh then let's go back to our controller.

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.709
Uh then let's go back to our controller. Uh so what's actually happening? Uh we

01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719
Uh so what's actually happening? Uh we

01:57:00.719 --> 01:57:02.629
Uh so what's actually happening? Uh we rendering a form and then whenever

01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639
rendering a form and then whenever

01:57:02.639 --> 01:57:06.470
rendering a form and then whenever somebody click save we need to submit uh

01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480
somebody click save we need to submit uh

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.629
somebody click save we need to submit uh validate submit the form and save it to

01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639
validate submit the form and save it to

01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:11.750
validate submit the form and save it to database. So you can create your custom

01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760
database. So you can create your custom

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.790
database. So you can create your custom helper for this sorry custom form

01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800
helper for this sorry custom form

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.109
helper for this sorry custom form handler for this if you want. Um if you

01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119
handler for this if you want. Um if you

01:57:19.119 --> 01:57:21.270
handler for this if you want. Um if you need to do some custom

01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280
need to do some custom

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.750
need to do some custom things like send email in the process or

01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760
things like send email in the process or

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.910
things like send email in the process or do some other stuff. But if you just

01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920
do some other stuff. But if you just

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.910
do some other stuff. But if you just want to save the data as is based on

01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920
want to save the data as is based on

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.870
want to save the data as is based on your entity and form type then you

01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880
your entity and form type then you

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.070
your entity and form type then you actually can just use our

01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080
actually can just use our

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.229
actually can just use our update handler that we have ready for

01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239
update handler that we have ready for

01:57:38.239 --> 01:57:40.550
update handler that we have ready for you. So, and this is happening here

01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560
you. So, and this is happening here

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.310
you. So, and this is happening here because this payment term entity is

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320
because this payment term entity is

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.910
because this payment term entity is really simple. We just want to save the

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920
really simple. We just want to save the

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.870
really simple. We just want to save the label as is and that's it. So, in our

01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880
label as is and that's it. So, in our

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.750
label as is and that's it. So, in our update method, we're passing to it

01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760
update method, we're passing to it

01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.910
update method, we're passing to it either new empty entity or existing one

01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920
either new empty entity or existing one

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.870
either new empty entity or existing one and in our update method

01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880
and in our update method

01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:59.750
and in our update method uh first we're creating a form and this

01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760
uh first we're creating a form and this

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.510
uh first we're creating a form and this method create a form it's actually

01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520
method create a form it's actually

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.229
method create a form it's actually coming from uh the parent abstract

01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239
coming from uh the parent abstract

01:58:04.239 --> 01:58:06.310
coming from uh the parent abstract controller. So, in this case if you want

01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320
controller. So, in this case if you want

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:08.950
controller. So, in this case if you want to have the update action

01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960
to have the update action

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.870
to have the update action you actually need to start extending the

01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880
you actually need to start extending the

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:14.709
you actually need to start extending the abstract controller from

01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719
abstract controller from

01:58:14.719 --> 01:58:19.350
abstract controller from uh symfony framework bundle.

01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360
uh symfony framework bundle.

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.270
uh symfony framework bundle. Uh so first you create a form

01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280
Uh so first you create a form

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.189
Uh so first you create a form based on the class and based on the

01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199
based on the class and based on the

01:58:25.199 --> 01:58:27.430
based on the class and based on the entity. So this form is already either

01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440
entity. So this form is already either

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.709
entity. So this form is already either empty or or with some data of existing

01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719
empty or or with some data of existing

01:58:30.719 --> 01:58:33.510
empty or or with some data of existing entity and then you need to use update

01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520
entity and then you need to use update

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.149
entity and then you need to use update method of our update handler facade

01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159
method of our update handler facade

01:58:36.159 --> 01:58:39.270
method of our update handler facade service. So this is the update form uh

01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280
service. So this is the update form uh

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:42.390
service. So this is the update form uh handler service that is ready for you to

01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400
handler service that is ready for you to

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.589
handler service that is ready for you to use. All you need to do is basically use

01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599
use. All you need to do is basically use

01:58:45.599 --> 01:58:47.910
use. All you need to do is basically use it and use the update method on it. For

01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920
it and use the update method on it. For

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.229
it and use the update method on it. For the update method or the only things you

01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239
the update method or the only things you

01:58:50.239 --> 01:58:52.870
the update method or the only things you need to pass is the entity that you want

01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880
need to pass is the entity that you want

01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:55.270
need to pass is the entity that you want to save the form that you want to save

01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280
to save the form that you want to save

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:57.990
to save the form that you want to save it with and then whenever it will be

01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000
it with and then whenever it will be

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.350
it with and then whenever it will be saved and uh everything will be okay

01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360
saved and uh everything will be okay

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.430
saved and uh everything will be okay then third parameter is a success

01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440
then third parameter is a success

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.030
then third parameter is a success message.

01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040
message.

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.270
message. Okay. Why we're passing the form?

01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280
Okay. Why we're passing the form?

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.510
Okay. Why we're passing the form? Because we're submitting entity through

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520
Because we're submitting entity through

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.589
Because we're submitting entity through the form for example to execute

01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599
the form for example to execute

01:59:11.599 --> 01:59:14.550
the form for example to execute validation.

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560
validation.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.910
validation. Uh so for simple entities

01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920
Uh so for simple entities

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.310
Uh so for simple entities just use update handler facade and

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320
just use update handler facade and

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:26.149
just use update handler facade and you'll be good to go.

01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:30.310
Okay. Uh the last action is delete. And

01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320
Okay. Uh the last action is delete. And

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:33.589
Okay. Uh the last action is delete. And normally in PHP code you will fetch the

01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599
normally in PHP code you will fetch the

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:38.310
normally in PHP code you will fetch the entity then uh remove it mark it as to

01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320
entity then uh remove it mark it as to

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.030
entity then uh remove it mark it as to be removed in the manager and then

01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040
be removed in the manager and then

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.030
be removed in the manager and then flashed. So save this fact delete it

01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040
flashed. So save this fact delete it

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:46.709
flashed. So save this fact delete it from the database. Okay. So this is how

01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719
from the database. Okay. So this is how

01:59:46.719 --> 01:59:50.229
from the database. Okay. So this is how you would do it.

01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239
you would do it.

01:59:50.239 --> 01:59:53.430
you would do it. Remove and flash. Okay.

01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440
Remove and flash. Okay.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:56.149
Remove and flash. Okay. Uh this is how you would do it in code.

01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159
Uh this is how you would do it in code.

01:59:56.159 --> 01:59:59.270
Uh this is how you would do it in code. uh in controller actually you don't need

01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280
uh in controller actually you don't need

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.669
uh in controller actually you don't need to do anything to have it. There is a

02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679
to do anything to have it. There is a

02:00:01.679 --> 02:00:04.790
to do anything to have it. There is a way to have this delete button uh for

02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800
way to have this delete button uh for

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:09.589
way to have this delete button uh for free both

02:00:09.599 --> 02:00:14.629
here on the data grid or here in the

02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639
here on the data grid or here in the

02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:17.510
here on the data grid or here in the view page. And this is because we have

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520
view page. And this is because we have

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:21.430
view page. And this is because we have this global delete method uh defined. Uh

02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440
this global delete method uh defined. Uh

02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.149
this global delete method uh defined. Uh and this global delete methods has just

02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159
and this global delete methods has just

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:27.109
and this global delete methods has just some preconditions. If those uh

02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119
some preconditions. If those uh

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:29.990
some preconditions. If those uh preconditions are met, then this button

02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000
preconditions are met, then this button

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.350
preconditions are met, then this button will appear on view page or on data

02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360
will appear on view page or on data

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.629
will appear on view page or on data grid. What are those preconditions? Uh

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639
grid. What are those preconditions? Uh

02:00:36.639 --> 02:00:40.470
grid. What are those preconditions? Uh so our global delete action is checking

02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480
so our global delete action is checking

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.950
so our global delete action is checking existence of this route name here. Okay.

02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960
existence of this route name here. Okay.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.030
existence of this route name here. Okay. So this is the config section of our

02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040
So this is the config section of our

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:48.629
So this is the config section of our entity

02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639
entity

02:00:48.639 --> 02:00:51.109
entity and uh this config is basically there in

02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119
and uh this config is basically there in

02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:54.790
and uh this config is basically there in the database as serialized uh inside the

02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800
the database as serialized uh inside the

02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.750
the database as serialized uh inside the serialized uh column and all this

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760
serialized uh column and all this

02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:00.950
serialized uh column and all this configuration is fetched is actually uh

02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960
configuration is fetched is actually uh

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:05.990
configuration is fetched is actually uh pushed to our actions and action checks.

02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000
pushed to our actions and action checks.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.070
pushed to our actions and action checks. If there is a name route on your entity

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080
If there is a name route on your entity

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.669
If there is a name route on your entity then the delete button will be

02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679
then the delete button will be

02:01:11.679 --> 02:01:13.430
then the delete button will be displayed.

02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440
displayed.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.790
displayed. um why it's searching actually for this

02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800
um why it's searching actually for this

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:19.030
um why it's searching actually for this because for example when I'm on a view

02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040
because for example when I'm on a view

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:24.070
because for example when I'm on a view page and I will delete this uh entity it

02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.080
page and I will delete this uh entity it

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:27.189
page and I will delete this uh entity it needs to know where to redirect me okay

02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199
needs to know where to redirect me okay

02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:28.870
needs to know where to redirect me okay I cannot stay on this page because this

02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880
I cannot stay on this page because this

02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:31.109
I cannot stay on this page because this entity will not exist anymore after I

02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119
entity will not exist anymore after I

02:01:31.119 --> 02:01:34.229
entity will not exist anymore after I click delete so it do needs to redirect

02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239
click delete so it do needs to redirect

02:01:34.239 --> 02:01:36.790
click delete so it do needs to redirect me somewhere so it needs to have some

02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800
me somewhere so it needs to have some

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.030
me somewhere so it needs to have some information and actually our delete

02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040
information and actually our delete

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.830
information and actually our delete button is based on this information

02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840
button is based on this information

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:45.109
button is based on this information here. So, it will redirect me to this

02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119
here. So, it will redirect me to this

02:01:45.119 --> 02:01:49.350
here. So, it will redirect me to this route. This is actually task

02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360
route. This is actually task

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.390
route. This is actually task uh not payment term. Uh but yeah, the

02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400
uh not payment term. Uh but yeah, the

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.229
uh not payment term. Uh but yeah, the idea is the same.

02:01:56.239 --> 02:02:00.310
Um, and yes,

02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320
Um, and yes,

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.709
Um, and yes, &gt;&gt; had a question on those. So that at

02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719
&gt;&gt; had a question on those. So that at

02:02:02.719 --> 02:02:04.950
&gt;&gt; had a question on those. So that at config, if I go and change my entity and

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960
config, if I go and change my entity and

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:07.270
config, if I go and change my entity and I add configuration there, do I just run

02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280
I add configuration there, do I just run

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.830
I add configuration there, do I just run the like the entity config update and

02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840
the like the entity config update and

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.430
the like the entity config update and I'm good or do I need to build a

02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440
I'm good or do I need to build a

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.950
I'm good or do I need to build a migration to make those changes as well?

02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960
migration to make those changes as well?

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.030
migration to make those changes as well? &gt;&gt; You just need to run this command and

02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040
&gt;&gt; You just need to run this command and

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.430
&gt;&gt; You just need to run this command and this will be applied to database.

02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440
this will be applied to database.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.550
this will be applied to database. &gt;&gt; Okay, so it'll it's just I just need to

02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it'll it's just I just need to

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:25.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it'll it's just I just need to update the entity. I don't need to build

02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840
update the entity. I don't need to build

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.589
update the entity. I don't need to build a migration to

02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599
a migration to

02:02:27.599 --> 02:02:29.910
a migration to &gt;&gt; it will depend actually because for

02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920
&gt;&gt; it will depend actually because for

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.669
&gt;&gt; it will depend actually because for those elements like here you don't need

02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679
those elements like here you don't need

02:02:31.679 --> 02:02:35.109
those elements like here you don't need to do anything um additional but if you

02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119
to do anything um additional but if you

02:02:35.119 --> 02:02:40.629
to do anything um additional but if you will try to uh enable attachments

02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639
will try to uh enable attachments

02:02:40.639 --> 02:02:43.189
will try to uh enable attachments right so you need to enable it here but

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199
right so you need to enable it here but

02:02:43.199 --> 02:02:44.950
right so you need to enable it here but for the attachments remember that you

02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960
for the attachments remember that you

02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:47.109
for the attachments remember that you also need to create a relation between

02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119
also need to create a relation between

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:49.350
also need to create a relation between your entity and file entity

02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360
your entity and file entity

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:49.830
your entity and file entity &gt;&gt; okay

02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840
&gt;&gt; okay

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.070
&gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; so in this particular case you also need

02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080
&gt;&gt; so in this particular case you also need

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.149
&gt;&gt; so in this particular case you also need to have a migration but for example for

02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159
to have a migration but for example for

02:02:54.159 --> 02:02:57.109
to have a migration but for example for data audit security for specifying those

02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119
data audit security for specifying those

02:02:57.119 --> 02:02:59.510
data audit security for specifying those values you don't need to do any

02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520
values you don't need to do any

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.470
values you don't need to do any additional

02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480
additional

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.229
additional &gt;&gt; okay so the configuration itself will

02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239
&gt;&gt; okay so the configuration itself will

02:03:02.239 --> 02:03:03.990
&gt;&gt; okay so the configuration itself will update but

02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000
update but

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.790
update but &gt;&gt; if we need to add dependent pieces

02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800
&gt;&gt; if we need to add dependent pieces

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.270
&gt;&gt; if we need to add dependent pieces that'll have to happen we would have to

02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280
that'll have to happen we would have to

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.229
that'll have to happen we would have to do that anyways

02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239
do that anyways

02:03:10.239 --> 02:03:12.390
do that anyways &gt;&gt; database structure you will need to do

02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400
&gt;&gt; database structure you will need to do

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:13.270
&gt;&gt; database structure you will need to do it manually

02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280
it manually

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.629
it manually &gt;&gt; we would have to do that for attachments

02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639
&gt;&gt; we would have to do that for attachments

02:03:14.639 --> 02:03:16.790
&gt;&gt; we would have to do that for attachments anyways even if they were specified here

02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800
anyways even if they were specified here

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.109
anyways even if they were specified here we'd have to have a migration to do that

02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119
we'd have to have a migration to do that

02:03:19.119 --> 02:03:20.950
we'd have to have a migration to do that even if we were doing it up front like

02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960
even if we were doing it up front like

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.270
even if we were doing it up front like it's that's not an update issue it's

02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280
it's that's not an update issue it's

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.830
it's that's not an update issue it's just you have to do that always. Okay.

02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840
just you have to do that always. Okay.

02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:27.830
just you have to do that always. Okay. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah. So, this will just turn some

02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah. So, this will just turn some

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.750
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah. So, this will just turn some functionality on or off. If you turn

02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760
functionality on or off. If you turn

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:31.830
functionality on or off. If you turn attachments here on and don't create the

02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840
attachments here on and don't create the

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.229
attachments here on and don't create the migrations, then go to this entity,

02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239
migrations, then go to this entity,

02:03:34.239 --> 02:03:35.990
migrations, then go to this entity, you'll probably get a lot of errors

02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000
you'll probably get a lot of errors

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.910
you'll probably get a lot of errors because it will try to render some

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920
because it will try to render some

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.310
because it will try to render some relation that doesn't exist. So, it will

02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320
relation that doesn't exist. So, it will

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:41.750
relation that doesn't exist. So, it will show you that you forgot to add

02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760
show you that you forgot to add

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:42.709
show you that you forgot to add migration.

02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719
migration.

02:03:42.719 --> 02:03:44.870
migration. &gt;&gt; Okay, understood. I just wanted to make

02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, understood. I just wanted to make

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.629
&gt;&gt; Okay, understood. I just wanted to make sure. I was wrestling with this

02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639
sure. I was wrestling with this

02:03:46.639 --> 02:03:48.470
sure. I was wrestling with this yesterday and I wasn't sure if what I

02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480
yesterday and I wasn't sure if what I

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:50.229
yesterday and I wasn't sure if what I was doing here was working or if I had

02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239
was doing here was working or if I had

02:03:50.239 --> 02:03:51.589
was doing here was working or if I had to write a migration. So, I actually

02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599
to write a migration. So, I actually

02:03:51.599 --> 02:03:53.910
to write a migration. So, I actually ended up doing both. But um the

02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920
ended up doing both. But um the

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.229
ended up doing both. But um the migration was redundant. Then

02:03:58.239 --> 02:04:01.350
&gt;&gt; uh during executing migration one of

02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360
&gt;&gt; uh during executing migration one of

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.830
&gt;&gt; uh during executing migration one of those post migrations it's actually

02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840
those post migrations it's actually

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.149
those post migrations it's actually updating it.

02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159
updating it.

02:04:06.159 --> 02:04:08.070
updating it. &gt;&gt; There is this one post migration that is

02:04:08.070 --> 02:04:08.080
&gt;&gt; There is this one post migration that is

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.629
&gt;&gt; There is this one post migration that is called uh update entity config

02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639
called uh update entity config

02:04:10.639 --> 02:04:11.589
called uh update entity config something.

02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599
something.

02:04:11.599 --> 02:04:12.390
something. &gt;&gt; Okay.

02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You remember this long list of post

02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:14.080
&gt;&gt; You remember this long list of post

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.189
&gt;&gt; You remember this long list of post migrations, right?

02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199
migrations, right?

02:04:15.199 --> 02:04:15.589
migrations, right? &gt;&gt; Yep.

02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599
&gt;&gt; Yep.

02:04:15.599 --> 02:04:17.350
&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And one of them it's actually

02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And one of them it's actually

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And one of them it's actually doing this. So when you run migration

02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440
doing this. So when you run migration

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:21.830
doing this. So when you run migration you kind of don't need to additionally

02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840
you kind of don't need to additionally

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:25.109
you kind of don't need to additionally execute this uh config update config

02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119
execute this uh config update config

02:04:25.119 --> 02:04:27.189
execute this uh config update config command. But if you add for example this

02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199
command. But if you add for example this

02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:29.669
command. But if you add for example this line then this is not connected to any

02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679
line then this is not connected to any

02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:31.350
line then this is not connected to any migration or anything. You need to

02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360
migration or anything. You need to

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:33.109
migration or anything. You need to execute the commands to update config

02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119
execute the commands to update config

02:04:33.119 --> 02:04:34.229
execute the commands to update config and you're good to go.

02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239
and you're good to go.

02:04:34.239 --> 02:04:37.510
and you're good to go. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.830
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Sure.

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840
&gt;&gt; Sure.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.189
&gt;&gt; Sure. Uh okay. And uh I will show you now the

02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199
Uh okay. And uh I will show you now the

02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:46.070
Uh okay. And uh I will show you now the definition of this delete action. uh but

02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080
definition of this delete action. uh but

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.990
definition of this delete action. uh but I will not dig deeper because actually

02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000
I will not dig deeper because actually

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.189
I will not dig deeper because actually this operations functionality is part of

02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199
this operations functionality is part of

02:04:51.199 --> 02:04:53.350
this operations functionality is part of the workflows topic and we're going to

02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360
the workflows topic and we're going to

02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.270
the workflows topic and we're going to talk about it in the details in the

02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280
talk about it in the details in the

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:58.149
talk about it in the details in the workflow topic that will be next week.

02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159
workflow topic that will be next week.

02:04:58.159 --> 02:05:02.070
workflow topic that will be next week. Uh so just to show you uh how

02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:02.080
Uh so just to show you uh how

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:04.310
Uh so just to show you uh how basically it looks we have this

02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320
basically it looks we have this

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:07.270
basically it looks we have this functionality called operations. So here

02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280
functionality called operations. So here

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.830
functionality called operations. So here we have a list of operations and those

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840
we have a list of operations and those

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:14.629
we have a list of operations and those are some definitions for um

02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639
are some definitions for um

02:05:14.639 --> 02:05:18.310
are some definitions for um interaction with user and basically all

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320
interaction with user and basically all

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.510
interaction with user and basically all each operation at the end renders some

02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520
each operation at the end renders some

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.270
each operation at the end renders some button that you can click and do

02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280
button that you can click and do

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.510
button that you can click and do something. Uh so why does delete action

02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520
something. Uh so why does delete action

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:30.870
something. Uh so why does delete action can will appear on every data grid and

02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880
can will appear on every data grid and

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.750
can will appear on every data grid and for every entity view page because this

02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760
for every entity view page because this

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:35.750
for every entity view page because this operations

02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760
operations

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:38.310
operations this operation has option to specify it

02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320
this operation has option to specify it

02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:41.350
this operation has option to specify it and here we have for all entities for

02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360
and here we have for all entities for

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:44.229
and here we have for all entities for all data grids. If we specify it to true

02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239
all data grids. If we specify it to true

02:05:44.239 --> 02:05:48.790
all data grids. If we specify it to true this action uh will try to render it for

02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800
this action uh will try to render it for

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.430
this action uh will try to render it for every entity on the view page and for

02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440
every entity on the view page and for

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:54.229
every entity on the view page and for all data grids. Yeah, for all data

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239
all data grids. Yeah, for all data

02:05:54.239 --> 02:05:56.629
all data grids. Yeah, for all data grids, uh there are other options you

02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639
grids, uh there are other options you

02:05:56.639 --> 02:05:58.629
grids, uh there are other options you can specify that not for all entities

02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639
can specify that not for all entities

02:05:58.639 --> 02:06:00.870
can specify that not for all entities but only for some specific ones and so

02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880
but only for some specific ones and so

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.350
but only for some specific ones and so on. I will show you all those options

02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360
on. I will show you all those options

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.070
on. I will show you all those options during the workflows topic. Uh and then

02:06:06.070 --> 02:06:06.080
during the workflows topic. Uh and then

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.750
during the workflows topic. Uh and then the important part for us is this

02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760
the important part for us is this

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.830
the important part for us is this preconditions. So whenever they are met

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840
preconditions. So whenever they are met

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.629
preconditions. So whenever they are met the button will be rendered and here we

02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639
the button will be rendered and here we

02:06:12.639 --> 02:06:14.870
the button will be rendered and here we have actually two preconditions. So we

02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880
have actually two preconditions. So we

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.470
have actually two preconditions. So we can either put this uh name route or

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480
can either put this uh name route or

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.629
can either put this uh name route or also specify the grid name. So this is

02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639
also specify the grid name. So this is

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:23.830
also specify the grid name. So this is the second way uh to do it. Uh it will

02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840
the second way uh to do it. Uh it will

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.430
the second way uh to do it. Uh it will be hard for me to show you the example

02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440
be hard for me to show you the example

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.189
be hard for me to show you the example because basically we're using the first

02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199
because basically we're using the first

02:06:27.199 --> 02:06:30.790
because basically we're using the first condition like in 99% of percent of our

02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800
condition like in 99% of percent of our

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.790
condition like in 99% of percent of our entities. Um so

02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800
entities. Um so

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:37.830
entities. Um so this condition this precondition is met

02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840
this condition this precondition is met

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.550
this condition this precondition is met because we

02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560
because we

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:43.910
because we added this to our config and because of

02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920
added this to our config and because of

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:46.069
added this to our config and because of that and the fact that we have for all

02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079
that and the fact that we have for all

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:48.550
that and the fact that we have for all entities true and for all data grid true

02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560
entities true and for all data grid true

02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.709
entities true and for all data grid true that this delete button will appear on

02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719
that this delete button will appear on

02:06:50.719 --> 02:06:53.830
that this delete button will appear on your data grid and on the entity view

02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840
your data grid and on the entity view

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.790
your data grid and on the entity view page and will be working and this will

02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800
page and will be working and this will

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.950
page and will be working and this will all happen for free. All you need to do

02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960
all happen for free. All you need to do

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.669
all happen for free. All you need to do is specify this part and this should be

02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679
is specify this part and this should be

02:07:01.679 --> 02:07:06.390
is specify this part and this should be route name for your index page.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:11.189
Okay.

02:07:11.199 --> 02:07:13.750
Um the second part it's about

02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760
Um the second part it's about

02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:17.910
Um the second part it's about validation. So this is nothing custom to

02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920
validation. So this is nothing custom to

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:20.550
validation. So this is nothing custom to Oro. We don't have anything totally

02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560
Oro. We don't have anything totally

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:23.510
Oro. We don't have anything totally nothing custom here. Uh we're using

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520
nothing custom here. Uh we're using

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.669
nothing custom here. Uh we're using everything that Sona gives us. It's

02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679
everything that Sona gives us. It's

02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:30.390
everything that Sona gives us. It's enough. So nothing custom.

02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400
enough. So nothing custom.

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.149
enough. So nothing custom. Uh so we use validation to validate

02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159
Uh so we use validation to validate

02:07:32.159 --> 02:07:35.109
Uh so we use validation to validate entities. Um and we can assign

02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119
entities. Um and we can assign

02:07:35.119 --> 02:07:37.430
entities. Um and we can assign validation constraints to whole entity

02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440
validation constraints to whole entity

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.669
validation constraints to whole entity or only for some fields. So for fields

02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679
or only for some fields. So for fields

02:07:39.679 --> 02:07:42.149
or only for some fields. So for fields you will have constraints like not blank

02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159
you will have constraints like not blank

02:07:42.159 --> 02:07:44.790
you will have constraints like not blank um length or something and for entities

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800
um length or something and for entities

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.950
um length or something and for entities you will have probably more complicated

02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960
you will have probably more complicated

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:49.750
you will have probably more complicated constraints. Uh if you need some custom

02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760
constraints. Uh if you need some custom

02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:53.350
constraints. Uh if you need some custom validation you can implement it and uh

02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360
validation you can implement it and uh

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:56.069
validation you can implement it and uh bind it to your entity.

02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079
bind it to your entity.

02:07:56.079 --> 02:07:58.870
bind it to your entity. Um this validation

02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880
Um this validation

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.149
Um this validation sits in resources config validation. As

02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159
sits in resources config validation. As

02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:03.910
sits in resources config validation. As you can see it's not inside or subd

02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920
you can see it's not inside or subd

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:05.750
you can see it's not inside or subd directory because this is not orura

02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760
directory because this is not orura

02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:08.950
directory because this is not orura functionality but this file you don't

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960
functionality but this file you don't

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.030
functionality but this file you don't need to load additionally like services

02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040
need to load additionally like services

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.709
need to load additionally like services or anything. Okay. This is some

02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719
or anything. Okay. This is some

02:08:12.719 --> 02:08:14.790
or anything. Okay. This is some validation yam configuration and

02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800
validation yam configuration and

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:18.149
validation yam configuration and symphony handles loading it. Okay. You

02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159
symphony handles loading it. Okay. You

02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:20.149
symphony handles loading it. Okay. You just need to create the file and symfony

02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159
just need to create the file and symfony

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:22.790
just need to create the file and symfony will load it for you.

02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800
will load it for you.

02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:26.470
will load it for you. um and uh whatever is specified here all

02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480
um and uh whatever is specified here all

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.550
um and uh whatever is specified here all the constraints they are automatically

02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560
the constraints they are automatically

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:31.669
the constraints they are automatically triggered on form submission. Okay. So

02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679
triggered on form submission. Okay. So

02:08:31.679 --> 02:08:35.589
triggered on form submission. Okay. So this uh validation will also happen uh

02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599
this uh validation will also happen uh

02:08:35.599 --> 02:08:38.790
this uh validation will also happen uh we will talk about API topic next week

02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800
we will talk about API topic next week

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.430
we will talk about API topic next week but our API it's actually when you do

02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440
but our API it's actually when you do

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.510
but our API it's actually when you do the post request and create some entity

02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520
the post request and create some entity

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.310
the post request and create some entity it's submitting it through the form so

02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320
it's submitting it through the form so

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:52.709
it's submitting it through the form so validation will also happen there. Um

02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719
validation will also happen there. Um

02:08:52.719 --> 02:08:56.709
validation will also happen there. Um but if you're adding your entity from

02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719
but if you're adding your entity from

02:08:56.719 --> 02:08:59.990
but if you're adding your entity from the custom code some some I don't know

02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000
the custom code some some I don't know

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.189
the custom code some some I don't know PHP class helper whatever uh and you

02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199
PHP class helper whatever uh and you

02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:05.270
PHP class helper whatever uh and you want to validate it then remember that

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280
want to validate it then remember that

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.669
want to validate it then remember that there is this validator service and you

02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679
there is this validator service and you

02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:10.950
there is this validator service and you can always use it to manually validate

02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960
can always use it to manually validate

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.750
can always use it to manually validate um your entity in case you're not

02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760
um your entity in case you're not

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:16.470
um your entity in case you're not submitting it through the form

02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480
submitting it through the form

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.709
submitting it through the form and how does validation looks

02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:22.950
Okay, so validation YAML file. Then you

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960
Okay, so validation YAML file. Then you

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.870
Okay, so validation YAML file. Then you need to put the fully qualified class

02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880
need to put the fully qualified class

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:27.350
need to put the fully qualified class name of your entity. Then we have two

02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360
name of your entity. Then we have two

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.589
name of your entity. Then we have two sections, constraints and properties.

02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599
sections, constraints and properties.

02:09:29.599 --> 02:09:31.430
sections, constraints and properties. Inside constraints, you put the

02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440
Inside constraints, you put the

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.990
Inside constraints, you put the constraints for the whole entity.

02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000
constraints for the whole entity.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.510
constraints for the whole entity. Uh and in the properties we have it per

02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520
Uh and in the properties we have it per

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:39.990
Uh and in the properties we have it per field. Okay. So my contact has a first

02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000
field. Okay. So my contact has a first

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.910
field. Okay. So my contact has a first name, last name, gender, birthday and so

02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920
name, last name, gender, birthday and so

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.109
name, last name, gender, birthday and so on. And uh those are constraints like

02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119
on. And uh those are constraints like

02:09:45.119 --> 02:09:48.390
on. And uh those are constraints like length etc. uh all the constraints those

02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400
length etc. uh all the constraints those

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.550
length etc. uh all the constraints those short names they are coming from

02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560
short names they are coming from

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.470
short names they are coming from Symphona so we don't need to put the

02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480
Symphona so we don't need to put the

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.750
Symphona so we don't need to put the whole path because Symphona handles it

02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760
whole path because Symphona handles it

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.310
whole path because Symphona handles it just by name uh but as you can see if

02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320
just by name uh but as you can see if

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.229
just by name uh but as you can see if you create your custom constraint then

02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239
you create your custom constraint then

02:10:00.239 --> 02:10:02.229
you create your custom constraint then you need to put the whole path to your

02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239
you need to put the whole path to your

02:10:02.239 --> 02:10:05.669
you need to put the whole path to your constraint for this file to recognize it

02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679
constraint for this file to recognize it

02:10:05.679 --> 02:10:09.030
constraint for this file to recognize it okay there are plenty already um

02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040
okay there are plenty already um

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:15.510
okay there are plenty already um available constraints Yes.

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:19.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You wanted to ask a question?

02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You wanted to ask a question?

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.709
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You wanted to ask a question? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sorry was on mute. So this

02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sorry was on mute. So this

02:10:22.719 --> 02:10:26.149
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sorry was on mute. So this validation it happens on form level only

02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159
validation it happens on form level only

02:10:26.159 --> 02:10:30.550
validation it happens on form level only or on save level entity save level each

02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560
or on save level entity save level each

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.350
or on save level entity save level each time no matter if I have it in migration

02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360
time no matter if I have it in migration

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.830
time no matter if I have it in migration or whatever.

02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840
or whatever.

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:39.990
or whatever. &gt;&gt; No only on form validation. It's not

02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000
&gt;&gt; No only on form validation. It's not

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.350
&gt;&gt; No only on form validation. It's not bound to uh entity manager. So it's not

02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360
bound to uh entity manager. So it's not

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:48.229
bound to uh entity manager. So it's not bound to persist or anything like that.

02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239
bound to persist or anything like that.

02:10:48.239 --> 02:10:51.030
bound to persist or anything like that. It's bound to form.

02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040
It's bound to form.

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.229
It's bound to form. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

02:10:54.239 --> 02:10:59.189
Uh okay.

02:10:59.199 --> 02:11:01.910
Yes. Uh I was saying that you have a lot

02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920
Yes. Uh I was saying that you have a lot

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.790
Yes. Uh I was saying that you have a lot of already existing constraints like

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800
of already existing constraints like

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:07.109
of already existing constraints like those default ones like length, choice,

02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119
those default ones like length, choice,

02:11:07.119 --> 02:11:09.589
those default ones like length, choice, not blank etc.

02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599
not blank etc.

02:11:09.599 --> 02:11:12.390
not blank etc. uh then we can also here validate

02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400
uh then we can also here validate

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.470
uh then we can also here validate relations. So my contact has some

02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480
relations. So my contact has some

02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.470
relations. So my contact has some addresses and this is collection of

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480
addresses and this is collection of

02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.510
addresses and this is collection of addresses and this there is this special

02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520
addresses and this there is this special

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.430
addresses and this there is this special validator. So if you want to make sure

02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440
validator. So if you want to make sure

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:27.109
validator. So if you want to make sure that whenever you save the contact

02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119
that whenever you save the contact

02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:29.270
that whenever you save the contact we will also validate this address

02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280
we will also validate this address

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:31.910
we will also validate this address entity itself. Then you use this

02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920
entity itself. Then you use this

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:34.149
entity itself. Then you use this constraint called valid without any

02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159
constraint called valid without any

02:11:34.159 --> 02:11:35.589
constraint called valid without any parameters. This is just telling you

02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599
parameters. This is just telling you

02:11:35.599 --> 02:11:38.069
parameters. This is just telling you that the address itself as an entity

02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079
that the address itself as an entity

02:11:38.079 --> 02:11:41.270
that the address itself as an entity will be validated whenever you save the

02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280
will be validated whenever you save the

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:43.589
will be validated whenever you save the contact entity

02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599
contact entity

02:11:43.599 --> 02:11:47.990
contact entity and some other additional constraints.

02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000
and some other additional constraints.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.990
and some other additional constraints. Uh how to create this constraint?

02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000
Uh how to create this constraint?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.589
Uh how to create this constraint? This is also not sure if we have here

02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599
This is also not sure if we have here

02:11:55.599 --> 02:11:57.669
This is also not sure if we have here link to anywhere. No, because this is

02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679
link to anywhere. No, because this is

02:11:57.679 --> 02:12:01.910
link to anywhere. No, because this is symfony. So I I didn't give you a link

02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920
symfony. So I I didn't give you a link

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.910
symfony. So I I didn't give you a link here. But basically

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.550
basically

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.430
okay

02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440
okay

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.510
okay uh we have

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520
uh we have

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.589
uh we have constraint called has contact

02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599
constraint called has contact

02:12:17.599 --> 02:12:19.189
constraint called has contact information

02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199
information

02:12:19.199 --> 02:12:21.830
information and we have a validator that is used to

02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840
and we have a validator that is used to

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.109
and we have a validator that is used to validate this constraint. Okay. The

02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119
validate this constraint. Okay. The

02:12:25.119 --> 02:12:27.750
validate this constraint. Okay. The constraint needs to extend constraint

02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760
constraint needs to extend constraint

02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:30.629
constraint needs to extend constraint class from Symphona validator component.

02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639
class from Symphona validator component.

02:12:30.639 --> 02:12:36.550
class from Symphona validator component. And here will be um message that will be

02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560
And here will be um message that will be

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:39.750
And here will be um message that will be displayed for this

02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760
displayed for this

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:42.149
displayed for this if we'll have an error and here get

02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159
if we'll have an error and here get

02:12:42.159 --> 02:12:44.709
if we'll have an error and here get targets. Uh so this can be either a

02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719
targets. Uh so this can be either a

02:12:44.719 --> 02:12:51.030
targets. Uh so this can be either a class constraint or this can be

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.350
property. Okay, in our case, this is

02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360
property. Okay, in our case, this is

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.950
property. Okay, in our case, this is going to be a constraint that it's

02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960
going to be a constraint that it's

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.870
going to be a constraint that it's checking uh the whole entity. That's why

02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880
checking uh the whole entity. That's why

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.510
checking uh the whole entity. That's why we marked it as

02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520
we marked it as

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:04.069
we marked it as class constraint.

02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079
class constraint.

02:13:04.079 --> 02:13:06.870
class constraint. And then uh by default it will be

02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880
And then uh by default it will be

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:09.189
And then uh by default it will be validated by the validator that's name

02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199
validated by the validator that's name

02:13:09.199 --> 02:13:11.350
validated by the validator that's name is the same like has contact information

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360
is the same like has contact information

02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.910
is the same like has contact information validator.

02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920
validator.

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.270
validator. This is also a symphony rule that it

02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280
This is also a symphony rule that it

02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.669
This is also a symphony rule that it will look for basically validator named

02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679
will look for basically validator named

02:13:19.679 --> 02:13:22.629
will look for basically validator named the same way with validator postfix. And

02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639
the same way with validator postfix. And

02:13:22.639 --> 02:13:25.350
the same way with validator postfix. And here we need to specify the validate

02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360
here we need to specify the validate

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:27.109
here we need to specify the validate method in which you basically are

02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119
method in which you basically are

02:13:27.119 --> 02:13:29.589
method in which you basically are checking for something and then adding

02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599
checking for something and then adding

02:13:29.599 --> 02:13:32.790
checking for something and then adding an error adding violation in case

02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800
an error adding violation in case

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.310
an error adding violation in case something is wrong. Okay. And this

02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320
something is wrong. Okay. And this

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.750
something is wrong. Okay. And this constraint validator needs to implement

02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760
constraint validator needs to implement

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.830
constraint validator needs to implement constraint violating from the symphony

02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840
constraint violating from the symphony

02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:45.189
constraint violating from the symphony validator component.

02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199
validator component.

02:13:45.199 --> 02:13:55.030
validator component. Uh and

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.750
and our constraint needs to be

02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760
and our constraint needs to be

02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.069
and our constraint needs to be registered in the DI container.

02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079
registered in the DI container.

02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:04.950
registered in the DI container. Uh ah no, it doesn't need to be anymore.

02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960
Uh ah no, it doesn't need to be anymore.

02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:09.350
Uh ah no, it doesn't need to be anymore. That's why I was

02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:15.270
Yeah, it doesn't need to.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:21.750
be registered anymore.

02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:24.550
So our constraint validator, remember

02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560
So our constraint validator, remember

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.790
So our constraint validator, remember naming is important, needs to be the

02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800
naming is important, needs to be the

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:31.990
naming is important, needs to be the same. And that's pretty much it. And

02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000
same. And that's pretty much it. And

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.069
same. And that's pretty much it. And then you need to use the path to the

02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079
then you need to use the path to the

02:14:34.079 --> 02:14:35.990
then you need to use the path to the constraint

02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000
constraint

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.950
constraint inside

02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960
inside

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.990
inside our validators uh validation YAML file.

02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000
our validators uh validation YAML file.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.109
our validators uh validation YAML file. Okay.

02:14:47.119 --> 02:14:50.550
And the last element is a search that

02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560
And the last element is a search that

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:52.470
And the last element is a search that will Yes.

02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480
will Yes.

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.109
will Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh sir, can you explain the

02:14:57.119 --> 02:14:58.870
uh can you explain the idea of that

02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880
uh can you explain the idea of that

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:01.830
uh can you explain the idea of that constraint file? I didn't get it. Why do

02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840
constraint file? I didn't get it. Why do

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:05.270
constraint file? I didn't get it. Why do we need that? If we have validation,

02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280
we need that? If we have validation,

02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.750
we need that? If we have validation, what is constraint then?

02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760
what is constraint then?

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.950
what is constraint then? &gt;&gt; Constraint is uh it's a check. You

02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960
&gt;&gt; Constraint is uh it's a check. You

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:18.390
&gt;&gt; Constraint is uh it's a check. You you're checking your entity against some

02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400
you're checking your entity against some

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.149
you're checking your entity against some rules

02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159
rules

02:15:20.159 --> 02:15:23.830
rules and this is basically called constraint.

02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840
and this is basically called constraint.

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:29.910
and this is basically called constraint. But the validation isn't the same.

02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920
But the validation isn't the same.

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:33.510
But the validation isn't the same. &gt;&gt; Uh first you define a constraint. So uh

02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520
&gt;&gt; Uh first you define a constraint. So uh

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.830
&gt;&gt; Uh first you define a constraint. So uh the the the check and then you specify

02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840
the the the check and then you specify

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:40.790
the the the check and then you specify in the validator you specify the details

02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800
in the validator you specify the details

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:43.270
in the validator you specify the details of this check. So this will be just the

02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280
of this check. So this will be just the

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.229
of this check. So this will be just the name we want to check if has if this

02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239
name we want to check if has if this

02:15:46.239 --> 02:15:48.870
name we want to check if has if this entity has contact information and this

02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880
entity has contact information and this

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.470
entity has contact information and this constraint

02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480
constraint

02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:52.870
constraint uh the validator for this particular

02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880
uh the validator for this particular

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:55.430
uh the validator for this particular constraint. So for this particular check

02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440
constraint. So for this particular check

02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.589
constraint. So for this particular check rule I don't know the synonym for the

02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599
rule I don't know the synonym for the

02:15:57.599 --> 02:15:59.430
rule I don't know the synonym for the constraint word to be honest.

02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440
constraint word to be honest.

02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:03.669
constraint word to be honest. &gt;&gt; So uh I mean if constraint is not uh set

02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679
&gt;&gt; So uh I mean if constraint is not uh set

02:16:03.679 --> 02:16:06.229
&gt;&gt; So uh I mean if constraint is not uh set for the data will not work or what

02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239
for the data will not work or what

02:16:06.239 --> 02:16:09.109
for the data will not work or what &gt;&gt; you need both. So we need a constraint.

02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119
&gt;&gt; you need both. So we need a constraint.

02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:11.750
&gt;&gt; you need both. So we need a constraint. So the and then you'll say in your

02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760
So the and then you'll say in your

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.189
So the and then you'll say in your entity that you want to validate your

02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199
entity that you want to validate your

02:16:15.199 --> 02:16:17.430
entity that you want to validate your entity against this particular

02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440
entity against this particular

02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:19.830
entity against this particular constraint and this constraint cannot

02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840
constraint and this constraint cannot

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.470
constraint and this constraint cannot leave uh standalone. The constraint

02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480
leave uh standalone. The constraint

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:25.109
leave uh standalone. The constraint needs to have a validator behind it that

02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119
needs to have a validator behind it that

02:16:25.119 --> 02:16:27.830
needs to have a validator behind it that is basically doing all the job.

02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840
is basically doing all the job.

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.910
is basically doing all the job. &gt;&gt; So to have this you need actually both.

02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920
&gt;&gt; So to have this you need actually both.

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:31.669
&gt;&gt; So to have this you need actually both. First you need to have a constraint and

02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679
First you need to have a constraint and

02:16:31.679 --> 02:16:33.910
First you need to have a constraint and then a validator that is basically doing

02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920
then a validator that is basically doing

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:35.110
then a validator that is basically doing the job.

02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120
the job.

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:39.349
the job. Um could you open abstract constraint

02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359
Um could you open abstract constraint

02:16:39.359 --> 02:16:41.589
Um could you open abstract constraint just to see what method does it

02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599
just to see what method does it

02:16:41.599 --> 02:16:44.469
just to see what method does it providing? What is it?

02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479
providing? What is it?

02:16:44.479 --> 02:16:46.870
providing? What is it? &gt;&gt; Uh

02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880
&gt;&gt; Uh

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.150
&gt;&gt; Uh this one.

02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160
this one.

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.750
this one. &gt;&gt; Yeah,

02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:53.429
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just uh

02:16:53.439 --> 02:16:55.669
why do I need normalize? Oh yeah. Okay.

02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679
why do I need normalize? Oh yeah. Okay.

02:16:55.679 --> 02:16:59.429
why do I need normalize? Oh yeah. Okay. Normal it can be used to normalize

02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439
Normal it can be used to normalize

02:16:59.439 --> 02:17:01.990
Normal it can be used to normalize data before validation. All right, got

02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000
data before validation. All right, got

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:07.669
data before validation. All right, got it.

02:17:07.679 --> 02:17:09.190
Do you want me to open the base class

02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200
Do you want me to open the base class

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.870
Do you want me to open the base class for validator too?

02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880
for validator too?

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:13.190
for validator too? &gt;&gt; Um, no. Thank you.

02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200
&gt;&gt; Um, no. Thank you.

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.389
&gt;&gt; Um, no. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay.

02:17:18.399 --> 02:17:19.750
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:22.629
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, I just want to double check. So,

02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639
&gt;&gt; Uh, I just want to double check. So,

02:17:22.639 --> 02:17:25.509
&gt;&gt; Uh, I just want to double check. So, constraint is specifically used for the

02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519
constraint is specifically used for the

02:17:25.519 --> 02:17:29.910
constraint is specifically used for the validation uh of uh purpose of showing

02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920
validation uh of uh purpose of showing

02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:32.950
validation uh of uh purpose of showing some validation message. How what's the

02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960
some validation message. How what's the

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:36.950
some validation message. How what's the basic purpose of this?

02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960
basic purpose of this?

02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:39.270
basic purpose of this? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So constraint is basically to

02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So constraint is basically to

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.349
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So constraint is basically to validate your entity against something

02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359
validate your entity against something

02:17:41.359 --> 02:17:44.150
validate your entity against something to check something and if this check is

02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160
to check something and if this check is

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:47.429
to check something and if this check is not met you're adding a violation and

02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439
not met you're adding a violation and

02:17:47.439 --> 02:17:49.270
not met you're adding a violation and passing a message then this message

02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280
passing a message then this message

02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:51.910
passing a message then this message whenever you submit the form and this

02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920
whenever you submit the form and this

02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:53.429
whenever you submit the form and this check

02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439
check

02:17:53.439 --> 02:17:56.790
check will be executed but it will not match.

02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800
will be executed but it will not match.

02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:58.549
will be executed but it will not match. You will have this error message

02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559
You will have this error message

02:17:58.559 --> 02:18:05.030
You will have this error message displayed on the page.

02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:07.910
Okay.

02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920
Okay.

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:17.349
Okay. Okay.

02:18:17.359 --> 02:18:24.309
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:18:24.319 --> 02:18:29.030
Uh okay. So search

02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040
Uh okay. So search

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.509
Uh okay. So search we have separate search index for the

02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519
we have separate search index for the

02:18:31.519 --> 02:18:33.589
we have separate search index for the storefront and for the back office. So

02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599
storefront and for the back office. So

02:18:33.599 --> 02:18:35.830
storefront and for the back office. So whenever you see website search think

02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840
whenever you see website search think

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.990
whenever you see website search think about storefront. Whenever you see just

02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000
about storefront. Whenever you see just

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.790
about storefront. Whenever you see just search think about back office also

02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800
search think about back office also

02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:43.589
search think about back office also gathering data to the search index. It's

02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599
gathering data to the search index. It's

02:18:43.599 --> 02:18:45.830
gathering data to the search index. It's totally different there. It's much

02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840
totally different there. It's much

02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:48.549
totally different there. It's much easier for the back office.

02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559
easier for the back office.

02:18:48.559 --> 02:18:52.389
easier for the back office. Uh so in general um in the search index

02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399
Uh so in general um in the search index

02:18:52.399 --> 02:18:54.469
Uh so in general um in the search index we have our entities and then we're able

02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479
we have our entities and then we're able

02:18:54.479 --> 02:18:57.270
we have our entities and then we're able to uh

02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280
to uh

02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:01.190
to uh search for them. Uh so we specify

02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200
search for them. Uh so we specify

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.030
search for them. Uh so we specify uh what entities do we want to add to

02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040
uh what entities do we want to add to

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:04.790
uh what entities do we want to add to the search index. We need to specify

02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800
the search index. We need to specify

02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:07.750
the search index. We need to specify what fields of the entities and also we

02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760
what fields of the entities and also we

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.509
what fields of the entities and also we can uh index some relations.

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519
can uh index some relations.

02:19:11.519 --> 02:19:14.629
can uh index some relations. Um also in back office all the

02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639
Um also in back office all the

02:19:14.639 --> 02:19:18.230
Um also in back office all the autocomplete fields are using search.

02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240
autocomplete fields are using search.

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.190
autocomplete fields are using search. Okay. And all this definition sits

02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200
Okay. And all this definition sits

02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.910
Okay. And all this definition sits inside search young file.

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:31.509
And how to define this search file? It's

02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519
And how to define this search file? It's

02:19:31.519 --> 02:19:34.070
And how to define this search file? It's inside resources config oro. So it will

02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080
inside resources config oro. So it will

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.870
inside resources config oro. So it will be autoloaded for you. Then in the

02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880
be autoloaded for you. Then in the

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.429
be autoloaded for you. Then in the search name space we specify fully

02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439
search name space we specify fully

02:19:39.439 --> 02:19:42.709
search name space we specify fully qualified class name. And then we can

02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719
qualified class name. And then we can

02:19:42.719 --> 02:19:45.030
qualified class name. And then we can have some aliases.

02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040
have some aliases.

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:47.429
have some aliases. Uh

02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439
Uh

02:19:47.439 --> 02:19:50.230
Uh about this I will talk in a moment

02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240
about this I will talk in a moment

02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.469
about this I will talk in a moment because I will need to show you how this

02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479
because I will need to show you how this

02:19:52.479 --> 02:19:55.750
because I will need to show you how this work for you to know where this goes to.

02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760
work for you to know where this goes to.

02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:57.670
work for you to know where this goes to. But then basically we have a definition

02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680
But then basically we have a definition

02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:00.550
But then basically we have a definition of our fields and we can index as many

02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560
of our fields and we can index as many

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.190
of our fields and we can index as many fields as we want. definition is really

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200
fields as we want. definition is really

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:04.950
fields as we want. definition is really simple but because first we need to

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960
simple but because first we need to

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.870
simple but because first we need to specify the name. This will be the name

02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880
specify the name. This will be the name

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:10.469
specify the name. This will be the name of this field in our search engine.

02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479
of this field in our search engine.

02:20:10.479 --> 02:20:13.910
of this field in our search engine. Then uh

02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920
Then uh

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:16.950
Then uh type of our field name it's text and

02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960
type of our field name it's text and

02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:21.510
type of our field name it's text and then target fields. So the

02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520
then target fields. So the

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.630
then target fields. So the the field uh on our entity.

02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640
the field uh on our entity.

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:29.750
the field uh on our entity. Uh so basically you just specify the

02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760
Uh so basically you just specify the

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.309
Uh so basically you just specify the list of fields that you want to index

02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319
list of fields that you want to index

02:20:32.319 --> 02:20:35.670
list of fields that you want to index and and

02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680
and and

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:37.349
and and that's it actually the opposite this is

02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359
that's it actually the opposite this is

02:20:37.359 --> 02:20:39.670
that's it actually the opposite this is the name and the type in the index and

02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680
the name and the type in the index and

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:43.030
the name and the type in the index and this is the name on your entity. So with

02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040
this is the name on your entity. So with

02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:46.710
this is the name on your entity. So with those two parameters you can for example

02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720
those two parameters you can for example

02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:49.030
those two parameters you can for example um

02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040
um

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.270
um you can have different name on your

02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280
you can have different name on your

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:53.990
you can have different name on your entity and different name

02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000
entity and different name

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.990
entity and different name in the index or you can for example

02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000
in the index or you can for example

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.990
in the index or you can for example create a field in index called full name

02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000
create a field in index called full name

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.750
create a field in index called full name and index prefix first name and all

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760
and index prefix first name and all

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:09.110
and index prefix first name and all those five variables into the same uh

02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120
those five variables into the same uh

02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:11.830
those five variables into the same uh field in index. Okay. So this gives you

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840
field in index. Okay. So this gives you

02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:15.830
field in index. Okay. So this gives you options.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:19.110
Okay. Uh what about relations? So let's

02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120
Okay. Uh what about relations? So let's

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:21.750
Okay. Uh what about relations? So let's talk uh on the phones example. They all

02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760
talk uh on the phones example. They all

02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:24.870
talk uh on the phones example. They all look pretty much the same. So this is my

02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880
look pretty much the same. So this is my

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:28.790
look pretty much the same. So this is my contact. Contact has multiple phones and

02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800
contact. Contact has multiple phones and

02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:32.150
contact. Contact has multiple phones and phone is a standalone entity.

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160
phone is a standalone entity.

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.950
phone is a standalone entity. Uh but we don't want to index

02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960
Uh but we don't want to index

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:37.750
Uh but we don't want to index everything. We only want to index the

02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760
everything. We only want to index the

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.750
everything. We only want to index the phone number from this phone entity. So

02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760
phone number from this phone entity. So

02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:41.830
phone number from this phone entity. So my phone entity can probably has a

02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840
my phone entity can probably has a

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:45.030
my phone entity can probably has a label, phone number and some other

02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040
label, phone number and some other

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:48.950
label, phone number and some other fields. And I only want to index phone

02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960
fields. And I only want to index phone

02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.870
fields. And I only want to index phone number. Phone number is actually under

02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880
number. Phone number is actually under

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:53.190
number. Phone number is actually under the phone variable.

02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200
the phone variable.

02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.990
the phone variable. Uh and I want to index it into contact

02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:56.000
Uh and I want to index it into contact

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.389
Uh and I want to index it into contact phones. So right now in the search index

02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399
phones. So right now in the search index

02:21:58.399 --> 02:22:00.790
phones. So right now in the search index for my contact, I will have contact

02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800
for my contact, I will have contact

02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:03.750
for my contact, I will have contact phones field that will be filled in with

02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760
phones field that will be filled in with

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:06.950
phones field that will be filled in with all the phone numbers.

02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960
all the phone numbers.

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:11.429
all the phone numbers. And this is how to do it.

02:22:11.439 --> 02:22:15.830
Okay. Uh

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.670
now I would like to show you how this

02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680
now I would like to show you how this

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:20.630
now I would like to show you how this looks uh in the UI

02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640
looks uh in the UI

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:23.190
looks uh in the UI to be able to tell you where this part

02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200
to be able to tell you where this part

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:25.110
to be able to tell you where this part goes to.

02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120
goes to.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:27.990
goes to. So uh we have the search available here

02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000
So uh we have the search available here

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.389
So uh we have the search available here at the top left and we can search for

02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399
at the top left and we can search for

02:22:30.399 --> 02:22:36.389
at the top left and we can search for something. Let's search for Deborah.

02:22:36.399 --> 02:22:37.990
And as you can see now we have search

02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000
And as you can see now we have search

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.830
And as you can see now we have search results. Uh so this search result is

02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840
results. Uh so this search result is

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:43.830
results. Uh so this search result is rendered with a template. So we will

02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840
rendered with a template. So we will

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:47.190
rendered with a template. So we will have HTML tweak template behind this and

02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200
have HTML tweak template behind this and

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:51.190
have HTML tweak template behind this and it is rendering some result and it also

02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200
it is rendering some result and it also

02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:55.110
it is rendering some result and it also has a link to the view page here

02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120
has a link to the view page here

02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:58.070
has a link to the view page here and this goes exactly to this. First we

02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080
and this goes exactly to this. First we

02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:01.110
and this goes exactly to this. First we define where is the HTML tweak that is

02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120
define where is the HTML tweak that is

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:04.070
define where is the HTML tweak that is responsible for displaying a search

02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080
responsible for displaying a search

02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:07.030
responsible for displaying a search result for my contact entity and then

02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040
result for my contact entity and then

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:10.389
result for my contact entity and then the route is used by my search template

02:23:10.389 --> 02:23:10.399
the route is used by my search template

02:23:10.399 --> 02:23:12.950
the route is used by my search template to generate the link for the view page.

02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960
to generate the link for the view page.

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:15.110
to generate the link for the view page. So we need to pass the route name for

02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120
So we need to pass the route name for

02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:17.830
So we need to pass the route name for our view action and we need to pass the

02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840
our view action and we need to pass the

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:20.710
our view action and we need to pass the ID parameter because our view action

02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720
ID parameter because our view action

02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:25.110
ID parameter because our view action requires uh view uh id. So this route

02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120
requires uh view uh id. So this route

02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:27.030
requires uh view uh id. So this route will be generated and our search

02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040
will be generated and our search

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:31.349
will be generated and our search template will use it to display here

02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359
template will use it to display here

02:23:31.359 --> 02:23:33.830
template will use it to display here next to some other data is to display

02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840
next to some other data is to display

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:36.870
next to some other data is to display the link to the view page of our uh

02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880
the link to the view page of our uh

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:40.150
the link to the view page of our uh entity. Okay. So this is where this part

02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160
entity. Okay. So this is where this part

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:43.590
entity. Okay. So this is where this part goes to.

02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:45.429
Uh

02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439

&gt;&gt; Yep.

02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:51.910
&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Uh can we see what the template looks

02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920
&gt;&gt; Uh can we see what the template looks

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:54.230
&gt;&gt; Uh can we see what the template looks like? I'm just curious. Yeah, I'm just

02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240
like? I'm just curious. Yeah, I'm just

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.750
like? I'm just curious. Yeah, I'm just going to show you this now.

&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for this template, you also don't

02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680
So, for this template, you also don't

02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:05.110
So, for this template, you also don't need to create it from scratch. Uh you

02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120
need to create it from scratch. Uh you

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:06.790
need to create it from scratch. Uh you just need to pass some particular

02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800
just need to pass some particular

02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:09.910
just need to pass some particular variables extend our base template and

02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920
variables extend our base template and

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.950
variables extend our base template and this base template will render all this

02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960
this base template will render all this

02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:15.830
this base template will render all this uh for you in this format. But so you

02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840
uh for you in this format. But so you

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.469
uh for you in this format. But so you need to pass the URL uh you need to pass

02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479
need to pass the URL uh you need to pass

02:24:18.479 --> 02:24:21.030
need to pass the URL uh you need to pass this information data. This is the

02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040
this information data. This is the

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:22.550
this information data. This is the entity type. So there are a few

02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560
entity type. So there are a few

02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:25.349
entity type. So there are a few parameters that you need to pass there.

02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359
parameters that you need to pass there.

02:24:25.359 --> 02:24:28.950
parameters that you need to pass there. So uh there is also parameter to uh show

02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960
So uh there is also parameter to uh show

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:30.790
So uh there is also parameter to uh show image or not because sometimes we have

02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800
image or not because sometimes we have

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:33.910
image or not because sometimes we have avatar sometimes not.

02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920
avatar sometimes not.

02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:38.150
avatar sometimes not. Uh then in all our templates you'll see

02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160
Uh then in all our templates you'll see

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:40.389
Uh then in all our templates you'll see also those hints that because this is a

02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399
also those hints that because this is a

02:24:40.399 --> 02:24:43.590
also those hints that because this is a search result template you will by

02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600
search result template you will by

02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:46.150
search result template you will by default have two variables inside your

02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160
default have two variables inside your

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.349
default have two variables inside your entity and basically the item taken from

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359
entity and basically the item taken from

02:24:51.359 --> 02:24:54.870
entity and basically the item taken from the search index. Okay. So the record

02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880
the search index. Okay. So the record

02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:57.349
the search index. Okay. So the record URL will be in uh taken from the search

02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359
URL will be in uh taken from the search

02:24:57.359 --> 02:24:59.910
URL will be in uh taken from the search index and this goes back to this route

02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920
index and this goes back to this route

02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:02.230
index and this goes back to this route which will be generated and this uh will

02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240
which will be generated and this uh will

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.790
which will be generated and this uh will be used to display the view link. Okay.

02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800
be used to display the view link. Okay.

02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.590
be used to display the view link. Okay. Then we have some title

02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600
Then we have some title

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.870
Then we have some title entity type.

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880
entity type.

02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:15.990
entity type. Not sure where is title to be honest. I

02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000
Not sure where is title to be honest. I

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.830
Not sure where is title to be honest. I would need to check it. This is entity

02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840
would need to check it. This is entity

02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:20.950
would need to check it. This is entity type.

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.910
Title may be used to render the name for

02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920
Title may be used to render the name for

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.630
Title may be used to render the name for the link basically.

02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640
the link basically.

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:29.750
the link basically. And then we have entity info and entity

02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760
And then we have entity info and entity

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:32.630
And then we have entity info and entity info this is in this case an array

02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640
info this is in this case an array

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:34.870
info this is in this case an array because this displays this created at

02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880
because this displays this created at

02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:38.550
because this displays this created at and updated at. So we have label value

02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560
and updated at. So we have label value

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:41.830
and updated at. So we have label value pipe label value and this goes directly

02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840
pipe label value and this goes directly

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:43.750
pipe label value and this goes directly to

02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760
to

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:46.870
to this is a label under the title variable

02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880
this is a label under the title variable

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:49.110
this is a label under the title variable we have a label.

02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120
we have a label.

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.910
we have a label. Then we have value which is created at

02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920
Then we have value which is created at

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.790
Then we have value which is created at or n a and then we have second

02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800
or n a and then we have second

02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.630
or n a and then we have second which is displaying updated at. So we

02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640
which is displaying updated at. So we

02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:02.710
which is displaying updated at. So we have two elements and they will are

02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720
have two elements and they will are

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:08.469
have two elements and they will are displayed here divided by a pipe.

02:26:08.479 --> 02:26:10.710
So basically you need to pass this part

02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720
So basically you need to pass this part

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:13.670
So basically you need to pass this part this part.

02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680
this part.

02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:17.190
this part. This is very good example to follow

02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200
This is very good example to follow

02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:19.030
This is very good example to follow and the base template will just take

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040
and the base template will just take

02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.429
and the base template will just take those uh

02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439
those uh

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:24.950
those uh parameters and display it in this nice

02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960
parameters and display it in this nice

02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:27.429
parameters and display it in this nice way like here you'll have the same

02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439
way like here you'll have the same

02:26:27.439 --> 02:26:30.389
way like here you'll have the same styling etc. So always use the base

02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399
styling etc. So always use the base

02:26:30.399 --> 02:26:32.870
styling etc. So always use the base template it has all the classes and all

02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880
template it has all the classes and all

02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.870
template it has all the classes and all those divs spans and etc there. So your

02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880
those divs spans and etc there. So your

02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:43.510
those divs spans and etc there. So your record will be rendered in similar way.

02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:47.190
Okay.

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.870
Uh okay. So in the UI you already saw

02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880
Uh okay. So in the UI you already saw

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.790
Uh okay. So in the UI you already saw that uh in the

02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800
that uh in the

02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:56.950
that uh in the autocomplete.

02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960
autocomplete.

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:00.550
autocomplete. Okay. In the autocomplete

02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560
Okay. In the autocomplete

02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:05.590
Okay. In the autocomplete let's check this customer create.

02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:08.150
Okay, this is

02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160
Okay, this is

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.710
Okay, this is autocomplete

02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720
autocomplete

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:14.150
autocomplete that is coming from the search.

02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160
that is coming from the search.

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.349
that is coming from the search. Okay, and also this whole element uh

02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359
Okay, and also this whole element uh

02:27:19.359 --> 02:27:22.469
Okay, and also this whole element uh it's a form type called

02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479
it's a form type called

02:27:22.479 --> 02:27:26.790
it's a form type called create and select or and create inline

something. I will show you in a moment

02:27:28.399 --> 02:27:30.230
something. I will show you in a moment exactly what's the name for this form

02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240
exactly what's the name for this form

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:31.830
exactly what's the name for this form type.

02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840
type.

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:33.830
type. uh and you will see this particular

02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840
uh and you will see this particular

02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.910
uh and you will see this particular element in many places like here I

02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920
element in many places like here I

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:38.230
element in many places like here I already have two they always have

02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240
already have two they always have

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:40.309
already have two they always have autocomplete coming from the search

02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319
autocomplete coming from the search

02:27:40.319 --> 02:27:43.270
autocomplete coming from the search index but then you also have a burger

02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280
index but then you also have a burger

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.429
index but then you also have a burger which opens data grid and this comes

02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439
which opens data grid and this comes

02:27:45.439 --> 02:27:48.230
which opens data grid and this comes directly from your database so you can

02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240
directly from your database so you can

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:50.309
directly from your database so you can have situation when something it's not

02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319
have situation when something it's not

02:27:50.319 --> 02:27:53.510
have situation when something it's not indexed yet you will not have it on the

02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520
indexed yet you will not have it on the

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.270
indexed yet you will not have it on the autocomplete but you will have it here

02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280
autocomplete but you will have it here

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.030
autocomplete but you will have it here because this data grid it's taken

02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040
because this data grid it's taken

02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:00.230
because this data grid it's taken directly from the database

02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240
directly from the database

02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:02.630
directly from the database and then we have also this plus I icon

02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640
and then we have also this plus I icon

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.550
and then we have also this plus I icon that is basically opening the create

02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560
that is basically opening the create

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.510
that is basically opening the create page for us in a popup. Okay. So we can

02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520
page for us in a popup. Okay. So we can

02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:10.630
page for us in a popup. Okay. So we can in the same moment create and select

02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640
in the same moment create and select

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:15.670
in the same moment create and select this entity for my customer

02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680
this entity for my customer

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:18.230
this entity for my customer um

02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240
um

02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:20.309
um database structure. So in case we're not

02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319
database structure. So in case we're not

02:28:20.319 --> 02:28:22.309
database structure. So in case we're not using uh elastic search but we use

02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319
using uh elastic search but we use

02:28:22.319 --> 02:28:24.950
using uh elastic search but we use database. I think I already shown you

02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960
database. I think I already shown you

02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:29.030
database. I think I already shown you that on the first day but why not show

02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040
that on the first day but why not show

02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.270
that on the first day but why not show you again

02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:31.280
you again

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:36.630
you again search. Okay. So we have search um item

02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640
search. Okay. So we have search um item

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:40.469
search. Okay. So we have search um item here we are telling what entity we are

02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479
here we are telling what entity we are

02:28:40.479 --> 02:28:43.190
here we are telling what entity we are indexing and exactly which one because

02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200
indexing and exactly which one because

02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:46.389
indexing and exactly which one because this is the ID of my in this case email

02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399
this is the ID of my in this case email

02:28:46.399 --> 02:28:50.870
this is the ID of my in this case email user and then for each item

02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880
user and then for each item

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:55.429
user and then for each item we can uh index multiple values and they

02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439
we can uh index multiple values and they

02:28:55.439 --> 02:28:57.750
we can uh index multiple values and they have all different tables. So we have

02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760
have all different tables. So we have

02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.550
have all different tables. So we have separate table for text integer decimal

02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560
separate table for text integer decimal

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:03.190
separate table for text integer decimal and and date time and inside we just

02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200
and and date time and inside we just

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.630
and and date time and inside we just have item id that goes directly to this

02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640
have item id that goes directly to this

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:09.510
have item id that goes directly to this one row for example

02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520
one row for example

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:14.469
one row for example and the field name and index value.

02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479
and the field name and index value.

02:29:14.479 --> 02:29:16.790
and the field name and index value. So in case you're using database which

02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800
So in case you're using database which

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:18.870
So in case you're using database which is true for the training repository

02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880
is true for the training repository

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:21.510
is true for the training repository because it's community edition. Uh so

02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520
because it's community edition. Uh so

02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:23.270
because it's community edition. Uh so there are the tables in the database for

02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280
there are the tables in the database for

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:25.429
there are the tables in the database for that.

02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439
that.

02:29:25.439 --> 02:29:27.990
that. uh then we have a command to run

02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000
uh then we have a command to run

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.910
uh then we have a command to run reindex. So out of the box when you go

02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920
reindex. So out of the box when you go

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:33.030
reindex. So out of the box when you go to the UI and edit some entity and you

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040
to the UI and edit some entity and you

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:36.070
to the UI and edit some entity and you click save there will be a message

02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080
click save there will be a message

02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.750
click save there will be a message pushed to the message queue that this

02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760
pushed to the message queue that this

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:40.389
pushed to the message queue that this entity needs reindex. So you need to

02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399
entity needs reindex. So you need to

02:29:40.399 --> 02:29:43.030
entity needs reindex. So you need to have consumers running in order for this

02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040
have consumers running in order for this

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:44.710
have consumers running in order for this to

02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720
to

02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.110
to uh happen.

02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120
uh happen.

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.830
uh happen. Um

02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840
Um

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.110
Um but if you'd like to reindex everything

02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120
but if you'd like to reindex everything

02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.750
but if you'd like to reindex everything or even some particular entities but

02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760
or even some particular entities but

02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.270
or even some particular entities but you'd like to do it from the command

02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280
you'd like to do it from the command

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.750
you'd like to do it from the command line uh there is a command called oral

02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760
line uh there is a command called oral

02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:03.270
line uh there is a command called oral search reindex. If you execute it like

02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280
search reindex. If you execute it like

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:06.469
search reindex. If you execute it like this uh

02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479
this uh

02:30:06.479 --> 02:30:09.590
this uh the application will be reindexed. So in

02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600
the application will be reindexed. So in

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:13.990
the application will be reindexed. So in my case it's local and I know that my

02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000
my case it's local and I know that my

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.150
my case it's local and I know that my application is really small. So I will

02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160
application is really small. So I will

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.710
application is really small. So I will just execute it and

02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720
just execute it and

02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:20.550
just execute it and it will probably finish. Yeah, it

02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560
it will probably finish. Yeah, it

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:22.309
it will probably finish. Yeah, it already did. But never do this on

02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319
already did. But never do this on

02:30:22.319 --> 02:30:24.630
already did. But never do this on production because you can have a lot of

02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640
production because you can have a lot of

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:28.070
production because you can have a lot of data there. Uh so for this we have the

02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080
data there. Uh so for this we have the

02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:31.190
data there. Uh so for this we have the scheduled switch. Uh so basically this

02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200
scheduled switch. Uh so basically this

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:34.230
scheduled switch. Uh so basically this tells that we want to go do it through

02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240
tells that we want to go do it through

02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:37.349
tells that we want to go do it through the message Q. So if I use the switch

02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359
the message Q. So if I use the switch

02:30:37.359 --> 02:30:39.750
the message Q. So if I use the switch the reindex will not happen instantly

02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760
the reindex will not happen instantly

02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:42.230
the reindex will not happen instantly but the message that we want to reindex

02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240
but the message that we want to reindex

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:44.309
but the message that we want to reindex everything will be pushed to message Q

02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319
everything will be pushed to message Q

02:30:44.319 --> 02:30:47.030
everything will be pushed to message Q and then message Q will just process it

02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040
and then message Q will just process it

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.270
and then message Q will just process it uh part by part.

02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:49.280
uh part by part.

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.349
uh part by part. So in the background it will just

02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359
So in the background it will just

02:30:51.359 --> 02:30:54.469
So in the background it will just probably take take long time but it can

02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479
probably take take long time but it can

02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:58.230
probably take take long time but it can since it's through the message key.

02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240
since it's through the message key.

02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:00.469
since it's through the message key. uh and uh just as an information because

02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479
uh and uh just as an information because

02:31:00.479 --> 02:31:03.510
uh and uh just as an information because we haven't uh ACL

02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520
we haven't uh ACL

02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:07.590
we haven't uh ACL we we haven't spoke about ACL uh yet but

02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600
we we haven't spoke about ACL uh yet but

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:10.150
we we haven't spoke about ACL uh yet but inside the search whenever I search for

02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160
inside the search whenever I search for

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:13.030
inside the search whenever I search for some entity here it's also prefiltered

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040
some entity here it's also prefiltered

02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:16.150
some entity here it's also prefiltered by my ACL so for example I might not

02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160
by my ACL so for example I might not

02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:19.990
by my ACL so for example I might not have access to view some entity

02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000
have access to view some entity

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.790
have access to view some entity and the search query that is used here

02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800
and the search query that is used here

02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:25.190
and the search query that is used here in the background it's actually in the

02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200
in the background it's actually in the

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.670
in the background it's actually in the background applying my ACL permission

02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680
background applying my ACL permission

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:31.990
background applying my ACL permission ions and they are applied uh with ACL

02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000
ions and they are applied uh with ACL

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.190
ions and they are applied uh with ACL helper service. So in case you would

02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200
helper service. So in case you would

02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:38.150
helper service. So in case you would like to do it manually or basically to

02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160
like to do it manually or basically to

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.429
like to do it manually or basically to know the service name that is

02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439
know the service name that is

02:31:39.439 --> 02:31:43.190
know the service name that is responsible for applying ACL rules on

02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200
responsible for applying ACL rules on

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:46.790
responsible for applying ACL rules on top of for example this search query uh

02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800
top of for example this search query uh

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:51.030
top of for example this search query uh this is the guy that does it.

02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040
this is the guy that does it.

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:54.389
this is the guy that does it. Uh and coming back to this autocomplete

02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399
Uh and coming back to this autocomplete

02:31:54.399 --> 02:31:58.469
Uh and coming back to this autocomplete uh as you saw here

02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479
uh as you saw here

02:31:58.479 --> 02:32:04.870
uh as you saw here I have actually example for

02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:19.429
contact.

02:32:19.439 --> 02:32:23.110
So let it be this way. So this

02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120
So let it be this way. So this

02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:26.870
So let it be this way. So this autocomplete uh that you see here for

02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880
autocomplete uh that you see here for

02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:29.429
autocomplete uh that you see here for the account here for the group it's

02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439
the account here for the group it's

02:32:29.439 --> 02:32:32.950
the account here for the group it's using um search index. So this is

02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960
using um search index. So this is

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:35.030
using um search index. So this is actually some specific form type that

02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040
actually some specific form type that

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:37.750
actually some specific form type that it's filled with search index results

02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760
it's filled with search index results

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:40.950
it's filled with search index results and the form type for it

02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960
and the form type for it

02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:42.790
and the form type for it it's really simple in case you want to

02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800
it's really simple in case you want to

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:45.190
it's really simple in case you want to create something similar. So we're

02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200
create something similar. So we're

02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.750
create something similar. So we're creating just some form type uh symphony

02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760
creating just some form type uh symphony

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:50.790
creating just some form type uh symphony form type and extending u default

02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800
form type and extending u default

02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:53.750
form type and extending u default symfony abstract type.

02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760
symfony abstract type.

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.110
symfony abstract type. Uh then our parent will be in this case

02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120
Uh then our parent will be in this case

02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:00.309
Uh then our parent will be in this case or entity select or create inline type

02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319
or entity select or create inline type

02:33:00.319 --> 02:33:02.230
or entity select or create inline type and this is this long name that I

02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240
and this is this long name that I

02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:05.910
and this is this long name that I couldn't remember a second ago. Uh so

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:05.920
couldn't remember a second ago. Uh so

02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:07.830
couldn't remember a second ago. Uh so you want to extend some parent form type

02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840
you want to extend some parent form type

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:11.030
you want to extend some parent form type that is basically there for you and uh

02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040
that is basically there for you and uh

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:13.030
that is basically there for you and uh just by the name I can tell that this is

02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040
just by the name I can tell that this is

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:15.349
just by the name I can tell that this is exactly this because we are selecting or

02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359
exactly this because we are selecting or

02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:18.150
exactly this because we are selecting or inline creating right so we are either

02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160
inline creating right so we are either

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:24.230
inline creating right so we are either selecting or inline creating something

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:26.469
uh get name get block prefix standard

02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479
uh get name get block prefix standard

02:33:26.479 --> 02:33:31.030
uh get name get block prefix standard symfony form type elements uh

02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040
symfony form type elements uh

02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:33.349
symfony form type elements uh and then the only thing you need to do

02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359
and then the only thing you need to do

02:33:33.359 --> 02:33:36.389
and then the only thing you need to do inside the configure options s uh is to

02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399
inside the configure options s uh is to

02:33:36.399 --> 02:33:40.230
inside the configure options s uh is to put some defaults. Uh so first of all uh

02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240
put some defaults. Uh so first of all uh

02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:43.030
put some defaults. Uh so first of all uh it needs an autocomplete alias. You need

02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040
it needs an autocomplete alias. You need

02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:46.630
it needs an autocomplete alias. You need to create this service. I will show you

02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640
to create this service. I will show you

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:49.429
to create this service. I will show you in a moment how to create this service.

02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439
in a moment how to create this service.

02:33:49.439 --> 02:33:52.230
in a moment how to create this service. But uh this tells you that there is some

02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240
But uh this tells you that there is some

02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:55.429
But uh this tells you that there is some search handler with this alias and this

02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439
search handler with this alias and this

02:33:55.439 --> 02:33:58.309
search handler with this alias and this search handler is returning results from

02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319
search handler is returning results from

02:33:58.319 --> 02:34:01.429
search handler is returning results from search index to your form type. Okay. So

02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439
search index to your form type. Okay. So

02:34:01.439 --> 02:34:04.790
search index to your form type. Okay. So behind this alias there is a service PHP

02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800
behind this alias there is a service PHP

02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:08.150
behind this alias there is a service PHP class that it's taking contacts from

02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160
class that it's taking contacts from

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:10.790
class that it's taking contacts from elastic search or any other search index

02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800
elastic search or any other search index

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:14.389
elastic search or any other search index database for example and uh putting it

02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399
database for example and uh putting it

02:34:14.399 --> 02:34:18.070
database for example and uh putting it to this form. Then because this is also

02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080
to this form. Then because this is also

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.790
to this form. Then because this is also inline create we need to specify the

02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800
inline create we need to specify the

02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:23.110
inline create we need to specify the route for the create action and this

02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120
route for the create action and this

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.270
route for the create action and this will go to your controller create

02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280
will go to your controller create

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.710
will go to your controller create action. This will be this name and some

02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720
action. This will be this name and some

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:31.349
action. This will be this name and some additional elements.

02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359
additional elements.

02:34:31.359 --> 02:34:35.510
additional elements. for the UI basically. So placeholder.

02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520
for the UI basically. So placeholder.

02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:38.070
for the UI basically. So placeholder. So here we have choose an account and

02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080
So here we have choose an account and

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.230
So here we have choose an account and then we have two templates for the

02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240
then we have two templates for the

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:42.710
then we have two templates for the result and selection. So whenever one

02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720
result and selection. So whenever one

02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:46.950
result and selection. So whenever one template will be this one second if I

02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960
template will be this one second if I

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:52.309
template will be this one second if I select it probably it's almost the same.

02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319
select it probably it's almost the same.

02:34:52.319 --> 02:34:54.630
select it probably it's almost the same. Uh and

02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640
Uh and

02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:57.670
Uh and that's it. So basically you just need to

02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680
that's it. So basically you just need to

02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:59.830
that's it. So basically you just need to extend our parent

02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840
extend our parent

02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:02.070
extend our parent specify the route to create page for

02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080
specify the route to create page for

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.110
specify the route to create page for your entity and the most important part

02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120
your entity and the most important part

02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:08.070
your entity and the most important part create the search handler that will uh

02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080
create the search handler that will uh

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.710
create the search handler that will uh return uh in this particular case

02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720
return uh in this particular case

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:13.670
return uh in this particular case contacts to the select type. So how to

02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680
contacts to the select type. So how to

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:17.830
contacts to the select type. So how to create the search handler

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:19.429
here? Actually you don't need to

02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439
here? Actually you don't need to

02:35:19.439 --> 02:35:21.830
here? Actually you don't need to implement PHP class you just need to re

02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840
implement PHP class you just need to re

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:24.710
implement PHP class you just need to re register service because there is a uh

02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720
register service because there is a uh

02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:27.270
register service because there is a uh PHP class

02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280
PHP class

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:30.469
PHP class or from autocomplete search handler this

02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479
or from autocomplete search handler this

02:35:30.479 --> 02:35:32.389
or from autocomplete search handler this one

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399
one

02:35:32.399 --> 02:35:37.270
one uh it's inside our bundles and you can

02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280
uh it's inside our bundles and you can

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.910
uh it's inside our bundles and you can just basically use it so in Symphfony

02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920
just basically use it so in Symphfony

02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:43.030
just basically use it so in Symphfony you don't need to create like empty PHP

02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040
you don't need to create like empty PHP

02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:45.670
you don't need to create like empty PHP class say that it extends from parent

02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:45.680
class say that it extends from parent

02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:47.830
class say that it extends from parent but it will be totally empty. So

02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840
but it will be totally empty. So

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:49.990
but it will be totally empty. So Symphony allows us not to create those

02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000
Symphony allows us not to create those

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.990
Symphony allows us not to create those empty classes but just to register your

02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000
empty classes but just to register your

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.110
empty classes but just to register your custom service say that parents it's

02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120
custom service say that parents it's

02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:59.030
custom service say that parents it's some other class. This is just basically

02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040
some other class. This is just basically

02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:00.790
some other class. This is just basically inheritance.

02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800
inheritance.

02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:03.830
inheritance. Uh and now we have our handler

02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840
Uh and now we have our handler

02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:05.830
Uh and now we have our handler from the symphony point of view. This is

02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840
from the symphony point of view. This is

02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:08.870
from the symphony point of view. This is separate service. It just doesn't have

02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880
separate service. It just doesn't have

02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:11.190
separate service. It just doesn't have uh it has implementation in parent

02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200
uh it has implementation in parent

02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:14.710
uh it has implementation in parent class. It doesn't have it its own class.

02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720
class. It doesn't have it its own class.

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.590
class. It doesn't have it its own class. And our parent class uh requires you to

02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600
And our parent class uh requires you to

02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.710
And our parent class uh requires you to pass two parameters.

02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720
pass two parameters.

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.030
pass two parameters. What entity you want to look for? So

02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040
What entity you want to look for? So

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:25.110
What entity you want to look for? So we're searching we're returning the list

02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120
we're searching we're returning the list

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.870
we're searching we're returning the list of contacts and in which fields you're

02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880
of contacts and in which fields you're

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.110
of contacts and in which fields you're going to search

02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:36.630
this whatever type here let's say test.

02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640
this whatever type here let's say test.

02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:41.590
this whatever type here let's say test. So this search query

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.990
I want to search name prefix first name

02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000
I want to search name prefix first name

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.070
I want to search name prefix first name middle name last name and name safic

02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080
middle name last name and name safic

02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.630
middle name last name and name safic fields of contact

02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640
fields of contact

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:51.190
fields of contact against this uh sorry against this query

02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200
against this uh sorry against this query

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:55.510
against this uh sorry against this query and return proper results here. Okay so

02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520
and return proper results here. Okay so

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.990
and return proper results here. Okay so what entity inside which fields who

02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000
what entity inside which fields who

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.550
what entity inside which fields who we're searching and that's it. This is

02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560
we're searching and that's it. This is

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:03.270
we're searching and that's it. This is the only part that our parent class

02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280
the only part that our parent class

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.270
the only part that our parent class needs to work and it will return you the

02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280
needs to work and it will return you the

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.349
needs to work and it will return you the appropriate list of contacts all of them

02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359
appropriate list of contacts all of them

02:37:07.359 --> 02:37:11.429
appropriate list of contacts all of them or filtered by some query

02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439
or filtered by some query

02:37:11.439 --> 02:37:14.790
or filtered by some query from those uh fields and this search

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800
from those uh fields and this search

02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.270
from those uh fields and this search handler needs to be tagged as a form

02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280
handler needs to be tagged as a form

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.429
handler needs to be tagged as a form autocomplete search handler. So our

02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439
autocomplete search handler. So our

02:37:19.439 --> 02:37:23.030
autocomplete search handler. So our application needs to know that this

02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040
application needs to know that this

02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:26.469
application needs to know that this service is a search handler and you need

02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:26.479
service is a search handler and you need

02:37:26.479 --> 02:37:28.550
service is a search handler and you need to specify an alias. This is very

02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560
to specify an alias. This is very

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:30.309
to specify an alias. This is very important part because this is exactly

02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319
important part because this is exactly

02:37:30.319 --> 02:37:34.230
important part because this is exactly the alias that now we are passing here.

02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240
the alias that now we are passing here.

02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.270
the alias that now we are passing here. Okay. So autocomplete alias

02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280
Okay. So autocomplete alias

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.110
Okay. So autocomplete alias this form will use this particular

02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120
this form will use this particular

02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.750
this form will use this particular handler to get the results from index

02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760
handler to get the results from index

02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:47.830
handler to get the results from index engine

02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840
engine

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.750
engine and yes you can protect it with ACL

02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760
and yes you can protect it with ACL

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:52.309
and yes you can protect it with ACL resource. So we will talk about ACL like

02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319
resource. So we will talk about ACL like

02:37:52.319 --> 02:37:57.590
resource. So we will talk about ACL like it's our next topic so tomorrow.

02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:00.630
Okay. And that's basically it. Some

02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640
Okay. And that's basically it. Some

02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:02.710
Okay. And that's basically it. Some configuration uh sorry documentation for

02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720
configuration uh sorry documentation for

02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:05.110
configuration uh sorry documentation for future reference

02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120
future reference

02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:07.590
future reference uh and just best best practice uh for

02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600
uh and just best best practice uh for

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.309
uh and just best best practice uh for the whole like crowd and index

02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319
the whole like crowd and index

02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:12.550
the whole like crowd and index everything. Make sure that uh you

02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560
everything. Make sure that uh you

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:15.510
everything. Make sure that uh you translate values and that you also

02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520
translate values and that you also

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:17.910
translate values and that you also localize some values like display date

02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920
localize some values like display date

02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:20.790
localize some values like display date times in nice format based on

02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800
times in nice format based on

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.389
times in nice format based on localization because we have different

02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399
localization because we have different

02:38:22.399 --> 02:38:25.830
localization because we have different format for USA different for for me for

02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840
format for USA different for for me for

02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:29.270
format for USA different for for me for Poland we have different order in month

02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280
Poland we have different order in month

02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:32.230
Poland we have different order in month and and and day for example so make sure

02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240
and and and day for example so make sure

02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:35.190
and and and day for example so make sure all this fits the current localization

02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200
all this fits the current localization

02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.710
all this fits the current localization so this is why we have all those

02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720
so this is why we have all those

02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:39.190
so this is why we have all those translations etc. So whenever I change

02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200
translations etc. So whenever I change

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.830
translations etc. So whenever I change my uh language here in the back office,

02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840
my uh language here in the back office,

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:43.910
my uh language here in the back office, everything will actually uh be

02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920
everything will actually uh be

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:46.309
everything will actually uh be translated and my date format will be

02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319
translated and my date format will be

02:38:46.319 --> 02:38:49.429
translated and my date format will be also displayed like

02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439
also displayed like

02:38:49.439 --> 02:38:52.950
also displayed like in the way that this particular language

02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960
in the way that this particular language

02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:56.870
in the way that this particular language uses it.

02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:02.550
Okay, that's that's it.

02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.510
Uh yeah, any questions, additional ones?

02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520
Uh yeah, any questions, additional ones?

02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.349
Uh yeah, any questions, additional ones? Oh, I have a question related to the

02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359
Oh, I have a question related to the

02:39:09.359 --> 02:39:12.389
Oh, I have a question related to the exercise, the data grid one we did. Um,

02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399
exercise, the data grid one we did. Um,

02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:14.630
exercise, the data grid one we did. Um, in the slide it showed, you know, you

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640
in the slide it showed, you know, you

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.070
in the slide it showed, you know, you talked about the optional piece with the

02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080
talked about the optional piece with the

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:17.910
talked about the optional piece with the template and then in the screenshot it

02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920
template and then in the screenshot it

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:20.550
template and then in the screenshot it showed like the ID was in the format

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560
showed like the ID was in the format

02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:23.270
showed like the ID was in the format column. Do you have the code that does

02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280
column. Do you have the code that does

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:25.830
column. Do you have the code that does that? I'm just curious how you were able

02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840
that? I'm just curious how you were able

02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:28.550
that? I'm just curious how you were able to how you're able to access the entity

02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560
to how you're able to access the entity

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.389
to how you're able to access the entity information in another field.

02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399
information in another field.

02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:35.750
information in another field. &gt;&gt; Yep. Sure. So

02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760
&gt;&gt; Yep. Sure. So

02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:38.070
&gt;&gt; Yep. Sure. So when you specify the template in the

02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080
when you specify the template in the

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:39.270
when you specify the template in the data grid

02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280
data grid

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:39.910
data grid &gt;&gt; mhm

02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920
&gt;&gt; mhm

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.030
&gt;&gt; mhm &gt;&gt; in the background or it's fetching uh

02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040
&gt;&gt; in the background or it's fetching uh

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.710
&gt;&gt; in the background or it's fetching uh some information for you and this would

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720
some information for you and this would

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:47.830
some information for you and this would be the template.

02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840
be the template.

02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:48.309
be the template. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

02:39:48.319 --> 02:39:50.469
&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; To those template that are used in data

02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479
&gt;&gt; To those template that are used in data

02:39:50.479 --> 02:39:53.990
&gt;&gt; To those template that are used in data grid we always inject two elements. One

02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000
grid we always inject two elements. One

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.710
grid we always inject two elements. One is the two variables where one is the

02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720
is the two variables where one is the

02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:58.950
is the two variables where one is the value and this is basically the value of

02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960
value and this is basically the value of

02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:01.110
value and this is basically the value of the cell. So this is the format and

02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120
the cell. So this is the format and

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:02.870
the cell. So this is the format and second you have access to record and

02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880
second you have access to record and

02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:04.230
second you have access to record and this is the whole row.

02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240
this is the whole row.

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:04.790
this is the whole row. &gt;&gt; Okay.

02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:07.750
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And on the row you can use the get value

02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760
&gt;&gt; And on the row you can use the get value

02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:11.590
&gt;&gt; And on the row you can use the get value here you can in our case pass id title

02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600
here you can in our case pass id title

02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.349
here you can in our case pass id title right because this is whole row and you

02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359
right because this is whole row and you

02:40:13.359 --> 02:40:16.389
right because this is whole row and you can display other fields.

02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399
can display other fields.

02:40:16.399 --> 02:40:18.150
can display other fields. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah I was looking trying to

02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah I was looking trying to

02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:19.670
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah I was looking trying to figure it out and I found there was like

02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680
figure it out and I found there was like

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:21.349
figure it out and I found there was like a context you can pass but that's

02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359
a context you can pass but that's

02:40:21.359 --> 02:40:23.670
a context you can pass but that's static. So and then you can use a method

02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680
static. So and then you can use a method

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.030
static. So and then you can use a method to pass it but I thought that was a

02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040
to pass it but I thought that was a

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:27.190
to pass it but I thought that was a little overboard but yeah this makes

02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200
little overboard but yeah this makes

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.510
little overboard but yeah this makes sense. It's very simple.

02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520
sense. It's very simple.

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:32.710
sense. It's very simple. Yeah. So we we have it here so you can

02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720
Yeah. So we we have it here so you can

02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:33.670
Yeah. So we we have it here so you can just use it.

02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680
just use it.

02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:41.349
just use it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

02:40:41.359 --> 02:40:44.870
&gt;&gt; Uh okay we have like half an hour to

02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880
&gt;&gt; Uh okay we have like half an hour to

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:48.469
&gt;&gt; Uh okay we have like half an hour to finish. So

02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479
finish. So

02:40:48.479 --> 02:40:51.910
finish. So uh I will

02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920
uh I will

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.230
uh I will &gt;&gt; I have a question. Um can you um tell me

02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240
&gt;&gt; I have a question. Um can you um tell me

02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:59.910
&gt;&gt; I have a question. Um can you um tell me maybe example of the uh complex

02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920
maybe example of the uh complex

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.590
maybe example of the uh complex uh complex save action when two forms

02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600
uh complex save action when two forms

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:08.070
uh complex save action when two forms are saved at the same time. Um how how

02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080
are saved at the same time. Um how how

02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:10.230
are saved at the same time. Um how how this case is resolved. Example, if you

02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:10.240
this case is resolved. Example, if you

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.990
this case is resolved. Example, if you have address customer and address

02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000
have address customer and address

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:20.790
have address customer and address um how it is saved then

02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:28.469
&gt;&gt; uh

02:41:28.479 --> 02:41:33.590
you're asking me about something like

02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:39.349
that I have

02:41:39.359 --> 02:41:41.990
uh where I can have it actually we can

02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000
uh where I can have it actually we can

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.830
uh where I can have it actually we can check the customer and address so let's

02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840
check the customer and address so let's

02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:48.070
check the customer and address so let's go here

02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080
go here

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:50.070
go here and we have our customer and also

02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080
and we have our customer and also

02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:53.110
and we have our customer and also addresses saved right this is what you

02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120
addresses saved right this is what you

02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:53.510
addresses saved right this is what you mean

02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520
mean

02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:54.710

&gt;&gt; right right yeah &gt;&gt; so yeah behind this there is a

02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920
&gt;&gt; so yeah behind this there is a

02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:00.230
&gt;&gt; so yeah behind this there is a controller that is doing all this it

02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240
controller that is doing all this it

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:02.389
controller that is doing all this it doesn't have this default handler this

02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399
doesn't have this default handler this

02:42:02.399 --> 02:42:05.429
doesn't have this default handler this is some additional form handler and yay

02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439
is some additional form handler and yay

02:42:05.439 --> 02:42:08.150
is some additional form handler and yay I can totally find the code that is

02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160
I can totally find the code that is

02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:11.510
I can totally find the code that is responsible for the for this and share

02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520
responsible for the for this and share

02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:14.070
responsible for the for this and share uh the links to appropriate classes but

02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080
uh the links to appropriate classes but

02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:15.590
uh the links to appropriate classes but I will not do it right now because I

02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600
I will not do it right now because I

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:17.270

&gt;&gt; I will come back to you with an list of

02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:29.510
&gt;&gt; I will come back to you with an list of classes responsible for saying that

02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.510
I will do it once you'll be doing the

02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520
I will do it once you'll be doing the

02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:34.870
I will do it once you'll be doing the practice. So I have some time then.

02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880
practice. So I have some time then.

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:36.950
practice. So I have some time then. Okay. uh since we have still half an

02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960
Okay. uh since we have still half an

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:39.510
Okay. uh since we have still half an hour so let me do this way that I will

02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520
hour so let me do this way that I will

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:42.950
hour so let me do this way that I will explain you the practice part and then

02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960
explain you the practice part and then

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:46.469
explain you the practice part and then basically you can start today

02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479
basically you can start today

02:42:46.479 --> 02:42:48.230
basically you can start today uh but basically we're going to do this

02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240
uh but basically we're going to do this

02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:51.990
uh but basically we're going to do this practice tomorrow because it's already

02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000
practice tomorrow because it's already

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.510
practice tomorrow because it's already almost over today's session. So let me

02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520
almost over today's session. So let me

02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:05.510
almost over today's session. So let me just explain the practice and

02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.110
Uh okay. So here uh in the practice we

02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120
Uh okay. So here uh in the practice we

02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:11.270
Uh okay. So here uh in the practice we will only create the view page. We don't

02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.280
will only create the view page. We don't

02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.910
will only create the view page. We don't have enough time to create the whole CR

02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920
have enough time to create the whole CR

02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:16.950
have enough time to create the whole CR and we will do this uh one element to

02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960
and we will do this uh one element to

02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.550
and we will do this uh one element to have this delete uh button on the view

02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560
have this delete uh button on the view

02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:23.030
have this delete uh button on the view page and in our data grid. So you

02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040
page and in our data grid. So you

02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:24.469
page and in our data grid. So you already have index page, you already

02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479
already have index page, you already

02:43:24.479 --> 02:43:27.429
already have index page, you already have controller uh you have data grid.

02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439
have controller uh you have data grid.

02:43:27.439 --> 02:43:29.270
have controller uh you have data grid. So right now we want to create a view

02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:29.280
So right now we want to create a view

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:31.670
So right now we want to create a view page and on this view page the only

02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680
page and on this view page the only

02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:33.670
page and on this view page the only thing that we want to render is title

02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:33.680
thing that we want to render is title

02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:35.590
thing that we want to render is title and format.

02:43:35.590 --> 02:43:35.600
and format.

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:39.110
and format. The optional part will be grid of users

02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120
The optional part will be grid of users

02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:41.190
The optional part will be grid of users uh who use this format. So this will be

02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200
uh who use this format. So this will be

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:44.309
uh who use this format. So this will be the way uh that I explained to you in

02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319
the way uh that I explained to you in

02:43:44.319 --> 02:43:47.510
the way uh that I explained to you in here. So those are grid of some entities

02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520
here. So those are grid of some entities

02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:51.110
here. So those are grid of some entities prefiltered by our entity ID.

02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120
prefiltered by our entity ID.

02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:53.750
prefiltered by our entity ID. But this is optional. So to create the

02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760
But this is optional. So to create the

02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:56.469
But this is optional. So to create the view page, we already have a controller

02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479
view page, we already have a controller

02:43:56.479 --> 02:43:58.150
view page, we already have a controller because we created it for the index

02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160
because we created it for the index

02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:00.710
because we created it for the index action. So we only need to create a view

02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720
action. So we only need to create a view

02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.670
action. So we only need to create a view action and to create a view template.

02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680
action and to create a view template.

02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:06.870
action and to create a view template. And for this you have examples for

02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880
And for this you have examples for

02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:11.910
And for this you have examples for example here. So this is for the view

02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920
example here. So this is for the view

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:15.110
example here. So this is for the view action

02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.469
and

02:44:18.479 --> 02:44:22.150
sorry

02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:24.070
you can use the last one. Then you will

02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080
you can use the last one. Then you will

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.710
you can use the last one. Then you will have example for optional part two.

02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720
have example for optional part two.

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:29.510
have example for optional part two. Actually optional part is selected here

02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520
Actually optional part is selected here

02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:32.469
Actually optional part is selected here and nonoptional part like the normal

02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479
and nonoptional part like the normal

02:44:32.479 --> 02:44:34.950
and nonoptional part like the normal part it's here at the top. Okay. So we

02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960
part it's here at the top. Okay. So we

02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:38.469
part it's here at the top. Okay. So we want to render in our case it's title

02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479
want to render in our case it's title

02:44:38.479 --> 02:44:40.950
want to render in our case it's title and format. Okay. So this is how you

02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960
and format. Okay. So this is how you

02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:44.630
and format. Okay. So this is how you will render it. Import UI render first

02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640
will render it. Import UI render first

02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:46.550
will render it. Import UI render first property for us. This will be title.

02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560
property for us. This will be title.

02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:50.150
property for us. This will be title. Here will be format and then push it to

02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160
Here will be format and then push it to

02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:54.389
Here will be format and then push it to the first block as a first sub block.

02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399
the first block as a first sub block.

02:44:54.399 --> 02:44:57.910
the first block as a first sub block. Then give it some ID

02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920
Then give it some ID

02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:00.950
Then give it some ID set data call parent and that's it. So

02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960
set data call parent and that's it. So

02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:04.070
set data call parent and that's it. So for the um normal nonoptional part

02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080
for the um normal nonoptional part

02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:06.309
for the um normal nonoptional part actually all the not selected elements

02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319
actually all the not selected elements

02:45:06.319 --> 02:45:09.429
actually all the not selected elements is what you want to do for the optional

02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439
is what you want to do for the optional

02:45:09.439 --> 02:45:13.429
is what you want to do for the optional part. So for displaying a grid

02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439
part. So for displaying a grid

02:45:13.439 --> 02:45:17.670
part. So for displaying a grid uh like this plus this or this plus

02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680
uh like this plus this or this plus

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:19.830
uh like this plus this or this plus this. So we only want one grid here in

02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840
this. So we only want one grid here in

02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.750
this. So we only want one grid here in the example you have actually two grids

02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:21.760
the example you have actually two grids

02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:23.269
the example you have actually two grids right

02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279
right

02:45:23.279 --> 02:45:25.670
right and you uh of course need to create this

02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680
and you uh of course need to create this

02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:30.070
and you uh of course need to create this grid first. So uh controller action view

02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080
grid first. So uh controller action view

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:33.990
grid first. So uh controller action view HTML tweak and you're done. Uh then we

02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000
HTML tweak and you're done. Uh then we

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.429
HTML tweak and you're done. Uh then we want to add uh view

02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439
want to add uh view

02:45:37.439 --> 02:45:41.190
want to add uh view row action to the grid. So we already

02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200
row action to the grid. So we already

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:44.630
row action to the grid. So we already have a grid of our usernaming types.

02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640
have a grid of our usernaming types.

02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:47.030
have a grid of our usernaming types. We have it here on the index page. And

02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040
We have it here on the index page. And

02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:49.349
We have it here on the index page. And you want to have this view icon here.

02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359
you want to have this view icon here.

02:45:49.359 --> 02:45:51.830
you want to have this view icon here. This view action. How to add a view

02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840
This view action. How to add a view

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.790
This view action. How to add a view action

02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800
action

02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:57.349
action and make it row action. So how to add a

02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359
and make it row action. So how to add a

02:45:57.359 --> 02:45:59.429
and make it row action. So how to add a view action? You will need to go back to

02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439
view action? You will need to go back to

02:45:59.439 --> 02:46:08.230
view action? You will need to go back to previous topic and search.

02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:10.870
Uh no

02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880
Uh no

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:12.630
Uh no I thought I given you a link on the

02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640
I thought I given you a link on the

02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:15.830
I thought I given you a link on the practice but I didn't.

02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840
practice but I didn't.

02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.750
practice but I didn't. Okay. We have here the simple grid

02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760
Okay. We have here the simple grid

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:20.309
Okay. We have here the simple grid example. So we need to add a view action

02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319
example. So we need to add a view action

02:46:20.319 --> 02:46:22.790
example. So we need to add a view action here and you can pick how to do it in

02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800
here and you can pick how to do it in

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:24.790
here and you can pick how to do it in here. So in the action section we add a

02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800
here. So in the action section we add a

02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:28.150
here. So in the action section we add a view action. Uh it's of type navigate

02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160
view action. Uh it's of type navigate

02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:30.309
view action. Uh it's of type navigate you need to give it some label. We have

02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319
you need to give it some label. We have

02:46:30.319 --> 02:46:33.030
you need to give it some label. We have some default translations. So in our uh

02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040
some default translations. So in our uh

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:36.790
some default translations. So in our uh oro uh data grid bundle we have this

02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800
oro uh data grid bundle we have this

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.790
oro uh data grid bundle we have this translation. So we can use exactly this

02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800
translation. So we can use exactly this

02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:40.790
translation. So we can use exactly this one.

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800
one.

02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.950
one. Uh no resource yet. Uh I icon always we

02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960
Uh no resource yet. Uh I icon always we

02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:48.150
Uh no resource yet. Uh I icon always we have I icon there. Uh row make it row

02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160
have I icon there. Uh row make it row

02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:50.630
have I icon there. Uh row make it row action. This will mean that uh whenever

02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640
action. This will mean that uh whenever

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:53.590
action. This will mean that uh whenever I click on this data grid, I don't need

02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600
I click on this data grid, I don't need

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.990
I click on this data grid, I don't need to click exactly this icon. I can click

02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000
to click exactly this icon. I can click

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.190
to click exactly this icon. I can click any place in the row and view will be

02:46:59.190 --> 02:46:59.200
any place in the row and view will be

02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.510
any place in the row and view will be the row action. So I will go to the view

02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520
the row action. So I will go to the view

02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:05.110
the row action. So I will go to the view page. Okay. So this is it and the most

02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120
page. Okay. So this is it and the most

02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:06.790
page. Okay. So this is it and the most important part the view link. But the

02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800
important part the view link. But the

02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:08.710
important part the view link. But the view link is actually an attribute

02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720
view link is actually an attribute

02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:11.750
view link is actually an attribute property that is created from some other

02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760
property that is created from some other

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:13.510
property that is created from some other properties. So you will need to have

02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520
properties. So you will need to have

02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:16.150
properties. So you will need to have also the properties section

02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160
also the properties section

02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.230
also the properties section uh view link that is a URL. This is your

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240
uh view link that is a URL. This is your

02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:23.269
uh view link that is a URL. This is your route name to the view page.

02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279
route name to the view page.

02:47:23.279 --> 02:47:25.110
route name to the view page. The one that you created in previous

02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120
The one that you created in previous

02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:27.750
The one that you created in previous point in this first point we created a

02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:27.760
point in this first point we created a

02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:30.790
point in this first point we created a view action in controller.

02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800
view action in controller.

02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:33.590
view action in controller. So this is the one and then parameter is

02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600
So this is the one and then parameter is

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:36.469
So this is the one and then parameter is ID because the view page needs to have

02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479
ID because the view page needs to have

02:47:36.479 --> 02:47:37.990
ID because the view page needs to have Yep.

02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000
Yep.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.070
Yep. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. One quick question. So

02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute. One quick question. So

02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:45.030
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute. One quick question. So row action two means it is that that

02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040
row action two means it is that that

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.590
row action two means it is that that link will be available for wall row. If

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600
link will be available for wall row. If

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:51.030
link will be available for wall row. If you want to target for only icon level

02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040
you want to target for only icon level

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:52.550
you want to target for only icon level target

02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560
target

02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.349
target when I click on that icon then only I

02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359
when I click on that icon then only I

02:47:55.359 --> 02:47:58.870
when I click on that icon then only I want to allow them to edit it. Do we

02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880
want to allow them to edit it. Do we

02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:03.030
want to allow them to edit it. Do we have such options?

02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:05.110
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I understood you

02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I understood you

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.429
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I understood you correctly. Are you asking me for

02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439
correctly. Are you asking me for

02:48:09.439 --> 02:48:13.110
correctly. Are you asking me for &gt;&gt; actions? So right now there is a I icon

02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120
&gt;&gt; actions? So right now there is a I icon

02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:14.070
&gt;&gt; actions? So right now there is a I icon right?

02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080
right?

02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:14.469
right? &gt;&gt; Yes.

02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:48:14.479 --> 02:48:15.990
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So

02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000
&gt;&gt; So

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.110
&gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; whether I click on I icon or the

02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120
&gt;&gt; whether I click on I icon or the

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:22.150
&gt;&gt; whether I click on I icon or the anywhere in that means same action but I

02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:22.160
anywhere in that means same action but I

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.349
anywhere in that means same action but I just want to allow a action clicking up

02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359
just want to allow a action clicking up

02:48:25.359 --> 02:48:28.150
just want to allow a action clicking up on I I icon only not the wall row

02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160
on I I icon only not the wall row

02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:29.349
on I I icon only not the wall row action.

02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359
action.

02:48:29.359 --> 02:48:31.510
action. &gt;&gt; So you don't put this row action to

02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520
&gt;&gt; So you don't put this row action to

02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.830
&gt;&gt; So you don't put this row action to true. Like for example here for the

02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840
true. Like for example here for the

02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:36.230
true. Like for example here for the update we don't have it. We can

02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240
update we don't have it. We can

02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:38.790
update we don't have it. We can basically have only one row action.

02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800
basically have only one row action.

02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:39.830
basically have only one row action. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So

02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:42.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So &gt;&gt; yes, we just don't put it.

02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080
&gt;&gt; yes, we just don't put it.

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:44.870
&gt;&gt; yes, we just don't put it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that parameter we can just

02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. So that parameter we can just

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:46.150
&gt;&gt; Okay. So that parameter we can just ignore it.

02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160
ignore it.

02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:49.830
ignore it. &gt;&gt; Yes. But actually the task was telling

02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840
&gt;&gt; Yes. But actually the task was telling

02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.910
&gt;&gt; Yes. But actually the task was telling you to

02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920
you to

02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:54.230
you to uh make it also as a row action. That's

02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240
uh make it also as a row action. That's

02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:56.469
uh make it also as a row action. That's why I explained it also to you. So you

02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479
why I explained it also to you. So you

02:48:56.479 --> 02:49:00.070
why I explained it also to you. So you will know how to u say that this action

02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080
will know how to u say that this action

02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:02.070
will know how to u say that this action should be row action. So if you don't it

02:49:02.070 --> 02:49:02.080
should be row action. So if you don't it

02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:04.950
should be row action. So if you don't it will just not do it.

02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960
will just not do it.

02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:07.910
will just not do it. &gt;&gt; That's okay. So coming back to the view

02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920
&gt;&gt; That's okay. So coming back to the view

02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.429
&gt;&gt; That's okay. So coming back to the view link uh yeah this is URL and it's going

02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439
link uh yeah this is URL and it's going

02:49:11.439 --> 02:49:13.590
link uh yeah this is URL and it's going to be generated based on some route and

02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600
to be generated based on some route and

02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:17.030
to be generated based on some route and you also need to pass ID uh yeah because

02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040
you also need to pass ID uh yeah because

02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:20.150
you also need to pass ID uh yeah because when we click here

02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160
when we click here

02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:22.710
when we click here here we need to open some particular uh

02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720
here we need to open some particular uh

02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.150
here we need to open some particular uh entity uh and this ID also needs to be

02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160
entity uh and this ID also needs to be

02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:29.030
entity uh and this ID also needs to be declared here as a property but for the

02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040
declared here as a property but for the

02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.190
declared here as a property but for the ID you only put tilda and this will

02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200
ID you only put tilda and this will

02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.510
ID you only put tilda and this will basically go directly to your select so

02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520
basically go directly to your select so

02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:36.790
basically go directly to your select so make sure you're selecting ID also

02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800
make sure you're selecting ID also

02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:38.950
make sure you're selecting ID also This will be matched with this ID and it

02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960
This will be matched with this ID and it

02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:41.830
This will be matched with this ID and it will be used to generate the URL and the

02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840
will be used to generate the URL and the

02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:44.550
will be used to generate the URL and the URL will be used in your view action to

02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560
URL will be used in your view action to

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.510
URL will be used in your view action to basically go somewhere. Right? So this

02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520
basically go somewhere. Right? So this

02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.190
basically go somewhere. Right? So this part

02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200
part

02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:53.590
part and this part

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:58.150
okay and then add delete row action. So

02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160
okay and then add delete row action. So

02:49:58.160 --> 02:49:59.670
okay and then add delete row action. So uh

02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680
uh

02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:03.429
uh how to get this delete button for free

02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439
how to get this delete button for free

02:50:03.439 --> 02:50:05.990
how to get this delete button for free almost for free and the delete here on

02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000
almost for free and the delete here on

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.550
almost for free and the delete here on the view page will also appear to do

02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560
the view page will also appear to do

02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.070
the view page will also appear to do this inside our usernaming type entity

02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:12.080
this inside our usernaming type entity

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:16.790
this inside our usernaming type entity uh you need to add

02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:19.670
this part. So in the config section just

02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680
this part. So in the config section just

02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:25.349
this part. So in the config section just add route name and fill it with the um

02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359
add route name and fill it with the um

02:50:25.359 --> 02:50:28.309
add route name and fill it with the um route name of your index page. Right? So

02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319
route name of your index page. Right? So

02:50:28.319 --> 02:50:32.950
route name of your index page. Right? So for us actually for me this is the route

02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960
for us actually for me this is the route

02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:35.830
for us actually for me this is the route name for my index is training usernaming

02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840
name for my index is training usernaming

02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:38.389
name for my index is training usernaming index. Okay. And you can also check it

02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399
index. Okay. And you can also check it

02:50:38.399 --> 02:50:41.110
index. Okay. And you can also check it in the controller.

02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120
in the controller.

02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:44.870
in the controller. Uh yeah and that's basically all for the

02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880
Uh yeah and that's basically all for the

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:47.429
Uh yeah and that's basically all for the nonoptional part. Then we have first

02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439
nonoptional part. Then we have first

02:50:47.439 --> 02:50:50.389
nonoptional part. Then we have first optional part which may not be so

02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399
optional part which may not be so

02:50:50.399 --> 02:50:52.389
optional part which may not be so interesting as the second. So I will

02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399
interesting as the second. So I will

02:50:52.399 --> 02:50:54.950
interesting as the second. So I will start from the second uh because second

02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:54.960
start from the second uh because second

02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:58.469
start from the second uh because second is actually to add our usernaming type

02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479
is actually to add our usernaming type

02:50:58.479 --> 02:51:00.790
is actually to add our usernaming type to the search index because right now if

02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800
to the search index because right now if

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:03.510
to the search index because right now if you try to search for it here you will

02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520
you try to search for it here you will

02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:05.590
you try to search for it here you will not have it yet.

02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600
not have it yet.

02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:07.590
not have it yet. So in case you'll have some more time

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600
So in case you'll have some more time

02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:10.389
So in case you'll have some more time you can start from this instead of this.

02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399
you can start from this instead of this.

02:51:10.399 --> 02:51:13.110
you can start from this instead of this. Okay. So you have all the hints here. uh

02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120
Okay. So you have all the hints here. uh

02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.950
Okay. So you have all the hints here. uh how to create the search YAML file

02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:14.960
how to create the search YAML file

02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:16.389
how to create the search YAML file because you need to create the search

02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399
because you need to create the search

02:51:16.399 --> 02:51:20.150
because you need to create the search YAML file. Uh create a template for the

02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160
YAML file. Uh create a template for the

02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:22.150
YAML file. Uh create a template for the search result.

02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160
search result.

02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:33.030
search result. Execute uh this method.

02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:35.670
Execute this or search index and you're

02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680
Execute this or search index and you're

02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:39.030
Execute this or search index and you're done. Okay. So basically only the

02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:39.040
done. Okay. So basically only the

02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:41.750
done. Okay. So basically only the definition and we want to index only

02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760
definition and we want to index only

02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:44.389
definition and we want to index only title field. So our definition will be

02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399
title field. So our definition will be

02:51:44.399 --> 02:51:46.309
title field. So our definition will be super short

02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319
super short

02:51:46.319 --> 02:51:49.349
super short uh template definition template execute

02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359
uh template definition template execute

02:51:49.359 --> 02:51:51.670
uh template definition template execute command to the index and you should see

02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680
command to the index and you should see

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:53.990
command to the index and you should see it in the search

02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000
it in the search

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.950
it in the search and this goes back actually totally not

02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960
and this goes back actually totally not

02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:59.510
and this goes back actually totally not related to or uh this is just a tweak

02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520
related to or uh this is just a tweak

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:02.070
related to or uh this is just a tweak extension. Okay. So in Oro internal in

02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080
extension. Okay. So in Oro internal in

02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:05.670
extension. Okay. So in Oro internal in Oro we use tweak templates. So uh this

02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680
Oro we use tweak templates. So uh this

02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:08.230
Oro we use tweak templates. So uh this is just to add a tweak extension to

02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240
is just to add a tweak extension to

02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:10.790
is just to add a tweak extension to render something. So it's up to you if

02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800
render something. So it's up to you if

02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:13.030
render something. So it's up to you if you prefer to create create a filter or

02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040
you prefer to create create a filter or

02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:16.630
you prefer to create create a filter or function. It doesn't matter. Uh and how

02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640
function. It doesn't matter. Uh and how

02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:21.110
function. It doesn't matter. Uh and how to create a tweak extension.

02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120
to create a tweak extension.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.590
to create a tweak extension. I've sent you a link to documentation

02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:23.600
I've sent you a link to documentation

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.910
I've sent you a link to documentation from Symphony because basically that's

02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920
from Symphony because basically that's

02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:28.550
from Symphony because basically that's really not Oro. uh so we don't have

02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560
really not Oro. uh so we don't have

02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:30.950
really not Oro. uh so we don't have anything in our documentation for it uh

02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960
anything in our documentation for it uh

02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:33.590
anything in our documentation for it uh because it's not our functionality

02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600
because it's not our functionality

02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:38.309
because it's not our functionality and here you have it and I think that

02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319
and here you have it and I think that

02:52:38.319 --> 02:52:42.230
and here you have it and I think that tweak was also somewhere

02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240
tweak was also somewhere

02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:45.110
tweak was also somewhere in this topic number three extending

02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120
in this topic number three extending

02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:48.710
in this topic number three extending functionality with bundles.

02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720
functionality with bundles.

02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:50.790
functionality with bundles. Yeah, here we had some tweak extension.

02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800
Yeah, here we had some tweak extension.

02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:54.070
Yeah, here we had some tweak extension. So you have a link to the example but

02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080
So you have a link to the example but

02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:56.790
So you have a link to the example but probably following documentation will be

02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800
probably following documentation will be

02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:00.389
probably following documentation will be much simpler.

02:53:00.399 --> 02:53:02.309
Okay.

02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319
Okay.

02:53:02.319 --> 02:53:06.230
Okay. Uh so guys uh I think we can finish for

02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240
Uh so guys uh I think we can finish for

02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:09.349
Uh so guys uh I think we can finish for today or you can start if you have still

02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359
today or you can start if you have still

02:53:09.359 --> 02:53:12.630
today or you can start if you have still some energy or whatever. Uh but we

02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:12.640
some energy or whatever. Uh but we

02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:14.630
some energy or whatever. Uh but we didn't have a lot of breaks today and

02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640
didn't have a lot of breaks today and

02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:18.309
didn't have a lot of breaks today and basically yeah

02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319
basically yeah

02:53:18.319 --> 02:53:20.550
basically yeah so let's finish for today. Tomorrow

02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560
so let's finish for today. Tomorrow

02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:24.469
so let's finish for today. Tomorrow we'll start from this practice um this

02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479
we'll start from this practice um this

02:53:24.479 --> 02:53:27.269
we'll start from this practice um this practice

02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279
practice

02:53:27.279 --> 02:53:29.110
practice and

02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120
and

02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:33.429
and &gt;&gt; so last question not related to this uh

02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439
&gt;&gt; so last question not related to this uh

02:53:33.439 --> 02:53:34.790
&gt;&gt; so last question not related to this uh topic.

02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800
topic.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:38.389
topic. &gt;&gt; So I I'm seeing we are uh going through

02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399
&gt;&gt; So I I'm seeing we are uh going through

02:53:38.399 --> 02:53:40.710
&gt;&gt; So I I'm seeing we are uh going through all the customization on the back end

02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720
all the customization on the back end

02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:43.510
all the customization on the back end level. So are you doing any any

02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520
level. So are you doing any any

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:45.990
level. So are you doing any any customization or any template level

02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000
customization or any template level

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.030
customization or any template level content level template updates?

02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040
content level template updates?

02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:51.830
content level template updates? No, there's no storefront theme uh topic

02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840
No, there's no storefront theme uh topic

02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:54.950
No, there's no storefront theme uh topic in this uh in this training.

02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960
in this uh in this training.

02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:56.469
in this uh in this training. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

02:53:56.469 --> 02:53:56.479
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

02:53:56.479 --> 02:53:58.950
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; We do have some additional so you can

02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960
&gt;&gt; We do have some additional so you can

02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:01.590
&gt;&gt; We do have some additional so you can request it from I don't know actually

02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600
request it from I don't know actually

02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:04.950
request it from I don't know actually who if it was Rulo or somebody else that

02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960
who if it was Rulo or somebody else that

02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:07.030
who if it was Rulo or somebody else that set up this training so you can reach

02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040
set up this training so you can reach

02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:08.469
set up this training so you can reach out to them.

02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479
out to them.

02:54:08.479 --> 02:54:11.110
out to them. &gt;&gt; Uh but basically the scope of this

02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120
&gt;&gt; Uh but basically the scope of this

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:12.870
&gt;&gt; Uh but basically the scope of this training

02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880
training

02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:15.990
training uh has a lot of elements but layouts are

02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000
uh has a lot of elements but layouts are

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.070
uh has a lot of elements but layouts are not one of them.

02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080
not one of them.

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:18.870
not one of them. Yeah, you know

02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880
Yeah, you know

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.830
Yeah, you know &gt;&gt; we still have ACL import a lot of things

02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840
&gt;&gt; we still have ACL import a lot of things

02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:25.030
&gt;&gt; we still have ACL import a lot of things to talk about.

02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040
to talk about.

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:26.950
to talk about. &gt;&gt; Definitely this session is definitely

02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960
&gt;&gt; Definitely this session is definitely

02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:29.910
&gt;&gt; Definitely this session is definitely helpful for expand enhancing the

02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920
helpful for expand enhancing the

02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.230
helpful for expand enhancing the features or expanding the new features

02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:34.240
features or expanding the new features

02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:37.830
features or expanding the new features on the back end level. But you know 60

02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840
on the back end level. But you know 60

02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:41.590
on the back end level. But you know 60 or 70% of clients are

02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600
or 70% of clients are

02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:44.150
or 70% of clients are uh they they do not much worry about the

02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160
uh they they do not much worry about the

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:46.469
uh they they do not much worry about the back end. they need a front level

02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479
back end. they need a front level

02:54:46.479 --> 02:54:50.469
back end. they need a front level solution to design or get some something

02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479
solution to design or get some something

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:53.110
solution to design or get some something fresh from the back end and list out on

02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:53.120
fresh from the back end and list out on

02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:56.790
fresh from the back end and list out on the front end. So if we could have this

02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800
the front end. So if we could have this

02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:58.550
the front end. So if we could have this type of documentation available

02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560
type of documentation available

02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:01.990
type of documentation available somewhere uh then also it would work

02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000
somewhere uh then also it would work

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.630
somewhere uh then also it would work otherwise I can definitely check with

02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640
otherwise I can definitely check with

02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:06.710
otherwise I can definitely check with our

02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720
our

02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:10.150
our our internal team who set up this uh

02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160
our internal team who set up this uh

02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:13.510
our internal team who set up this uh training for everyone. So sit

02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520
training for everyone. So sit

02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:16.469
training for everyone. So sit &gt;&gt; I mean we don't have such a training uh

02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479
&gt;&gt; I mean we don't have such a training uh

02:55:16.479 --> 02:55:19.269
&gt;&gt; I mean we don't have such a training uh like right now but yeah we can show you

02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279
like right now but yeah we can show you

02:55:19.279 --> 02:55:21.590
like right now but yeah we can show you something but that's need to be

02:55:21.590 --> 02:55:21.600
something but that's need to be

02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:24.790
something but that's need to be scheduled and for some time in the

02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800
scheduled and for some time in the

02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:25.980
scheduled and for some time in the future

02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:25.990
future

02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:27.269
future [Music]

02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279
[Music]

02:55:27.279 --> 02:55:31.349
[Music] &gt;&gt; and basically yes but um I don't really

02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359
&gt;&gt; and basically yes but um I don't really

02:55:31.359 --> 02:55:33.990
&gt;&gt; and basically yes but um I don't really agree that editing theme it's everything

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000
agree that editing theme it's everything

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.990
agree that editing theme it's everything because there you have just the styling

02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000
because there you have just the styling

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.150
because there you have just the styling and putting elements there but if you'd

02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160
and putting elements there but if you'd

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.750
and putting elements there but if you'd like to display additional uh element on

02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760
like to display additional uh element on

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:43.750
like to display additional uh element on the product view page for example you

02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760
the product view page for example you

02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.670
the product view page for example you need to first create this element so you

02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680
need to first create this element so you

02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:49.110
need to first create this element so you need to know this whole back end

02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120
need to know this whole back end

02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:50.710
need to know this whole back end information storefront is just

02:55:50.710 --> 02:55:50.720
information storefront is just

02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:53.670
information storefront is just displaying it but yes yes we using all

02:55:53.670 --> 02:55:53.680
displaying it but yes yes we using all

02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:55.349
displaying it but yes yes we using all oral layouts there this is totally

02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359
oral layouts there this is totally

02:55:55.359 --> 02:56:00.070
oral layouts there this is totally custom thing uh so I totally understand

02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080
custom thing uh so I totally understand

02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:02.630

you that you'd like to have some um training from this at least like one

02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:04.880
training from this at least like one

02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:06.870
training from this at least like one topic how to build theme and so on and

02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880
topic how to build theme and so on and

02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:11.910
topic how to build theme and so on and so on so this is more more back office

02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:11.920
so on so this is more more back office

02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:14.710
so on so this is more more back office for uh backend uh developers not for

02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720
for uh backend uh developers not for

02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:16.469
for uh backend uh developers not for front- end developers. This training is

02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479
front- end developers. This training is

02:56:16.479 --> 02:56:18.230
front- end developers. This training is yes more for back end developers than

02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240
yes more for back end developers than

02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:20.630
yes more for back end developers than front end developers.

02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640
front end developers.

02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:23.349
front end developers. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this training is absolutely

02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this training is absolutely

02:56:23.359 --> 02:56:27.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this training is absolutely helpful and clearing lots of question.

So that but I I was uh looking for some

02:56:31.439 --> 02:56:33.830
So that but I I was uh looking for some front end level options as well to

02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840
front end level options as well to

02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:38.150
front end level options as well to explore it and override something or

02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160
explore it and override something or

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:42.469
explore it and override something or design something uh beyond the limits.

02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479
