00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.430
Okay guys, let's start. Um,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.790
good morning, good afternoon, good

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
good morning, good afternoon, good

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.749
good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.470
Hope you are well.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.590
Uh, so I'm going to start from the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600
Uh, so I'm going to start from the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.070
Uh, so I'm going to start from the moment that we stopped yesterday. So we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080
moment that we stopped yesterday. So we

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.910
moment that we stopped yesterday. So we were actually almost at the end of this

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920
were actually almost at the end of this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.509
were actually almost at the end of this topic.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.229
uh and our topic was about entities and

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239
uh and our topic was about entities and

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.830
uh and our topic was about entities and migrations. So to summarize everything,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840
migrations. So to summarize everything,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.950
migrations. So to summarize everything, I've shown you how to create an entity.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960
I've shown you how to create an entity.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.950
I've shown you how to create an entity. Uh then the fact that we use entity

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
Uh then the fact that we use entity

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.510
Uh then the fact that we use entity repositories to fetch those data from

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520
repositories to fetch those data from

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.270
repositories to fetch those data from database

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
database

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.750
database uh how to do it properly, you have one

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760
uh how to do it properly, you have one

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.470
uh how to do it properly, you have one way to use manager registry and then

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480
way to use manager registry and then

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.189
way to use manager registry and then manager for class and repository for for

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
manager for class and repository for for

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830
manager for class and repository for for this class. or you can go with shortened

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
this class. or you can go with shortened

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510
this class. or you can go with shortened version just use another service

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
version just use another service

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.750
version just use another service doctrine helper for this and fetch

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760
doctrine helper for this and fetch

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.830
doctrine helper for this and fetch entity repository just with this one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
entity repository just with this one

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.670
entity repository just with this one method

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680
method

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.469
method uh then I've shown you uh how to how to

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479
uh then I've shown you uh how to how to

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.270
uh then I've shown you uh how to how to make your entity configurable and that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280
make your entity configurable and that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.149
make your entity configurable and that we can very easily uh turn on or off

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
we can very easily uh turn on or off

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.710
we can very easily uh turn on or off some functionalities for our entity

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
some functionalities for our entity

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830
some functionalities for our entity based on this entity configuration

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
based on this entity configuration

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230
based on this entity configuration uh and that we can do it from the UI and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
uh and that we can do it from the UI and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.350
uh and that we can do it from the UI and how to do it from code.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
how to do it from code.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.870
how to do it from code. Uh then uh we talked about extended

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880
Uh then uh we talked about extended

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.310
Uh then uh we talked about extended entities. Uh so how to make entity

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
entities. Uh so how to make entity

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.149
entities. Uh so how to make entity extendable

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
extendable

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.429
extendable uh and then

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439
uh and then

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.469
uh and then how to actually extend existing entities

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
how to actually extend existing entities

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.429
how to actually extend existing entities like core ones. So here you have uh

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439
like core ones. So here you have uh

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.550
like core ones. So here you have uh examples how to add a field to some

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
examples how to add a field to some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.749
examples how to add a field to some extended entity uh and how to add

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759
extended entity uh and how to add

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.230
extended entity uh and how to add relation

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
relation

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870
relation uh and a little bit about entity alias

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
uh and a little bit about entity alias

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550
uh and a little bit about entity alias is basically the fact that we're using

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
is basically the fact that we're using

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.350
is basically the fact that we're using them and they are generated based on

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
them and they are generated based on

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.510
them and they are generated based on some rules and that you can always

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520
some rules and that you can always

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.550
some rules and that you can always change it in entity. file if you want.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560
change it in entity. file if you want.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.710
change it in entity. file if you want. Uh then regarding the migrations we

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
Uh then regarding the migrations we

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.949
Uh then regarding the migrations we talked about this whole flow. So first

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
talked about this whole flow. So first

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.630
talked about this whole flow. So first of all we have four two elements uh for

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640
of all we have four two elements uh for

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.350
of all we have four two elements uh for the schema changes installer and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360
the schema changes installer and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.869
the schema changes installer and migrations

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879
migrations

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.670
migrations uh and actually about uh those two

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
uh and actually about uh those two

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.750
uh and actually about uh those two elements how to load data to database we

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
elements how to load data to database we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.990
elements how to load data to database we haven't spoken yet

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
haven't spoken yet

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.830
haven't spoken yet uh and regarding installer and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840
uh and regarding installer and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.150
uh and regarding installer and migrations we talked uh through the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
migrations we talked uh through the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.309
migrations we talked uh through the schema so

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319
schema so

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.589
schema so how this flow actually is happening from

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599
how this flow actually is happening from

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.509
how this flow actually is happening from the beginning when you create a bundle

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
the beginning when you create a bundle

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.110
the beginning when you create a bundle you have only installer then you have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
you have only installer then you have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.229
you have only installer then you have migration uh first second and so on and

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239
migration uh first second and so on and

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.470
migration uh first second and so on and so on.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
so on.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.070
so on. I've shown you where to put the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080
I've shown you where to put the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.270
I've shown you where to put the installer so it needs to be in migration

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
installer so it needs to be in migration

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.229
installer so it needs to be in migration schema uh and needs to implement

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239
schema uh and needs to implement

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.229
schema uh and needs to implement installation

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.750
and basically you have here the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760
and basically you have here the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.750
and basically you have here the complicated version of installer because

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
complicated version of installer because

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.830
complicated version of installer because the product bundle installer is a long

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
the product bundle installer is a long

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.229
the product bundle installer is a long one. So you'll have probably almost all

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239
one. So you'll have probably almost all

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.030
one. So you'll have probably almost all the examples inside here.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
the examples inside here.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.750
the examples inside here. Uh and then I've shown you where to put

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
Uh and then I've shown you where to put

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.149
Uh and then I've shown you where to put migrations. Okay. So also inside

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159
migrations. Okay. So also inside

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.710
migrations. Okay. So also inside migration schema uh then next directory

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
migration schema uh then next directory

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.750
migration schema uh then next directory it's migration version directory and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
it's migration version directory and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.430
it's migration version directory and file name is actually up to you. Uh and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440
file name is actually up to you. Uh and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.830
file name is actually up to you. Uh and here also you have example of some

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
here also you have example of some

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.270
here also you have example of some migration. the fact that we are using

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
migration. the fact that we are using

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.309
migration. the fact that we are using schema object here and

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319
schema object here and

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.270
schema object here and uh here is actually example how to add a

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
uh here is actually example how to add a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.869
uh here is actually example how to add a post query but on previous slide uh from

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879
post query but on previous slide uh from

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.869
post query but on previous slide uh from the installer you have example how to

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879
the installer you have example how to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.270
the installer you have example how to use the schema object so how to create a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280
use the schema object so how to create a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.750
use the schema object so how to create a table or get existing table and just add

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
table or get existing table and just add

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.869
table or get existing table and just add a column there uh and so on so basically

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879
a column there uh and so on so basically

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.070
a column there uh and so on so basically migration and installer inside they both

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080
migration and installer inside they both

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.429
migration and installer inside they both have this app method and inside here

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439
have this app method and inside here

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.750
have this app method and inside here they look exactly the Okay, just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760
they look exactly the Okay, just

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.630
they look exactly the Okay, just migrations are used to uh adjust

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640
migrations are used to uh adjust

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.710
migrations are used to uh adjust existing DB schema and in installer we

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720
existing DB schema and in installer we

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.070
existing DB schema and in installer we have the whole um structure for your

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080
have the whole um structure for your

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.910
have the whole um structure for your bundle

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
bundle

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.750
bundle and to load both installer and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760
and to load both installer and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.629
and to load both installer and migrations there is one command and it's

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
migrations there is one command and it's

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.830
migrations there is one command and it's called oruro migration load and this

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840
called oruro migration load and this

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.189
called oruro migration load and this command has a um safety switch. So if

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199
command has a um safety switch. So if

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.629
command has a um safety switch. So if you execute it like this uh it will not

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639
you execute it like this uh it will not

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.350
you execute it like this uh it will not do anything. you need to put the force

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360
do anything. you need to put the force

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.270
do anything. you need to put the force flag for it to be executed.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280
flag for it to be executed.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.990
flag for it to be executed. Uh okay. So last two elements. Uh so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
Uh okay. So last two elements. Uh so

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.629
Uh okay. So last two elements. Uh so basically now you know uh where to

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639
basically now you know uh where to

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.469
basically now you know uh where to create the installer and how this

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479
create the installer and how this

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.030
create the installer and how this installer can look like how to add a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
installer can look like how to add a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.870
installer can look like how to add a table, add a column etc.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880
table, add a column etc.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.909
table, add a column etc. Um and right now when you already have

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919
Um and right now when you already have

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.310
Um and right now when you already have tables you sometimes want to fill them

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
tables you sometimes want to fill them

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.710
tables you sometimes want to fill them with data. Sometimes those data will be

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720
with data. Sometimes those data will be

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.990
with data. Sometimes those data will be a demo data but sometimes those will be

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000
a demo data but sometimes those will be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.550
a demo data but sometimes those will be like some configuration or basically for

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560
like some configuration or basically for

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.030
like some configuration or basically for example product units. Okay. So product

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
example product units. Okay. So product

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.070
example product units. Okay. So product units are not demo data. They are just

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
units are not demo data. They are just

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.830
units are not demo data. They are just like a data that needs to be there

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840
like a data that needs to be there

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.350
like a data that needs to be there otherwise without product units

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360
otherwise without product units

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.870
otherwise without product units application will not work. We will not

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880
application will not work. We will not

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.590
application will not work. We will not be able to have prices etc. So we need

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600
be able to have prices etc. So we need

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.510
be able to have prices etc. So we need to have always some product units

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
to have always some product units

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.390
to have always some product units loaded. Uh so with those data fixtures

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400
loaded. Uh so with those data fixtures

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.590
loaded. Uh so with those data fixtures you can basically fill database with

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600
you can basically fill database with

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.350
you can basically fill database with some data uh and those are considered

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360
some data uh and those are considered

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.870
some data uh and those are considered like normal data not demo data.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880
like normal data not demo data.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.550
like normal data not demo data. So here we're using doctrine data

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
So here we're using doctrine data

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.670
So here we're using doctrine data fixtures. So nothing uh like installer

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
fixtures. So nothing uh like installer

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.590
fixtures. So nothing uh like installer and migration this was uh or way uh data

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600
and migration this was uh or way uh data

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.230
and migration this was uh or way uh data fixtures are doctrine way here we

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240
fixtures are doctrine way here we

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.070
fixtures are doctrine way here we actually interact with orum. So we're

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080
actually interact with orum. So we're

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.749
actually interact with orum. So we're going to create objects like new

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759
going to create objects like new

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.150
going to create objects like new something and then set values and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160
something and then set values and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.710
something and then set values and persist it to database.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
persist it to database.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.950
persist it to database. Um and migration sits inside migrations

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960
Um and migration sits inside migrations

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.790
Um and migration sits inside migrations data OM. Okay. So in this particular

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800
data OM. Okay. So in this particular

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.950
data OM. Okay. So in this particular particular directory

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960
particular directory

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.070
particular directory um we will search for uh data fixtures

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080
um we will search for uh data fixtures

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.070
um we will search for uh data fixtures and we'll load them all and the file

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080
and we'll load them all and the file

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.430
and we'll load them all and the file name is totally up to you.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440
name is totally up to you.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.550
name is totally up to you. uh example of this data fixture.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.189
So it's inside migrations data ORM and

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199
So it's inside migrations data ORM and

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.350
So it's inside migrations data ORM and this is basically loading product unit

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
this is basically loading product unit

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.469
this is basically loading product unit data. So we need to extend abstract

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479
data. So we need to extend abstract

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.510
data. So we need to extend abstract fixture from the doctrine

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520
fixture from the doctrine

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.390
fixture from the doctrine package and then basically we have a

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400
package and then basically we have a

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.309
package and then basically we have a load method in which we have the

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319
load method in which we have the

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.670
load method in which we have the manager. Okay. So we basically create an

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680
manager. Okay. So we basically create an

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.629
manager. Okay. So we basically create an object fill it with some data then

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639
object fill it with some data then

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.070
object fill it with some data then persist this object and then we need to

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080
persist this object and then we need to

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.749
persist this object and then we need to do flash to save this to database. Clear

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759
do flash to save this to database. Clear

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.830
do flash to save this to database. Clear it's not usually needed.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.749
Okay. What more

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759
Okay. What more

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.589
Okay. What more uh data fixtures can be dependent

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599
uh data fixtures can be dependent

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.430
uh data fixtures can be dependent ordered and versioned. Uh so if you have

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440
ordered and versioned. Uh so if you have

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.550
ordered and versioned. Uh so if you have data fixtures in multiple bundles and

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560
data fixtures in multiple bundles and

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.469
data fixtures in multiple bundles and you want to make sure that one fixture

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479
you want to make sure that one fixture

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.189
you want to make sure that one fixture will be executed after the other fixture

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199
will be executed after the other fixture

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.790
will be executed after the other fixture but they are not in the same bundle not

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800
but they are not in the same bundle not

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.070
but they are not in the same bundle not in the same directory. Uh so for this we

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080
in the same directory. Uh so for this we

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.110
in the same directory. Uh so for this we have dependent fixture interface. Uh and

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120
have dependent fixture interface. Uh and

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.070
have dependent fixture interface. Uh and this is basically an interface that will

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080
this is basically an interface that will

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.950
this is basically an interface that will force you to specify that your fixture

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960
force you to specify that your fixture

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.749
force you to specify that your fixture is dependent to some other. Okay, let's

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759
is dependent to some other. Okay, let's

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:39.189
is dependent to some other. Okay, let's uh

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:44.629
depend on fixture interface.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.510
Okay,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
Okay,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:08:01.430
Okay, let's say

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.550
maybe not in tests.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.749
Okay, it actually doesn't

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759
Okay, it actually doesn't

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.830
Okay, it actually doesn't doesn't matter. Uh, normally it looks

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840
doesn't matter. Uh, normally it looks

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.510
doesn't matter. Uh, normally it looks exactly the same. Um

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520
exactly the same. Um

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.830
exactly the same. Um so we want to make sure that this

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840
so we want to make sure that this

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.390
so we want to make sure that this particular fixture is loaded after after

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400
particular fixture is loaded after after

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.430
particular fixture is loaded after after some other. So for example users should

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440
some other. So for example users should

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.670
some other. So for example users should be loaded after organization because

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680
be loaded after organization because

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.350
be loaded after organization because user need to be assigned to some

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360
user need to be assigned to some

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.670
user need to be assigned to some organization. So if you want to create a

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680
organization. So if you want to create a

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.550
organization. So if you want to create a user uh you need to make sure that

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560
user uh you need to make sure that

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.709
user uh you need to make sure that organizations are already in place and

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719
organizations are already in place and

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:37.190
organizations are already in place and in this particular situation you'll your

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200
in this particular situation you'll your

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.269
in this particular situation you'll your fixture will implement dependent fixture

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279
fixture will implement dependent fixture

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.589
fixture will implement dependent fixture interface and this interface will force

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599
interface and this interface will force

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.070
interface and this interface will force you to specify dependencies and this is

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080
you to specify dependencies and this is

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.430
you to specify dependencies and this is basically an array of other fixtures

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440
basically an array of other fixtures

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.790
basically an array of other fixtures that needs to be loaded before this one.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800
that needs to be loaded before this one.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.269
that needs to be loaded before this one. Uh then we have ordered and this is

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279
Uh then we have ordered and this is

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:57.030
Uh then we have ordered and this is exactly the same as for uh migrations.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
exactly the same as for uh migrations.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.630
exactly the same as for uh migrations. So if you have multiple fixtures in one

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640
So if you have multiple fixtures in one

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.870
So if you have multiple fixtures in one directory in your bundle and you want to

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880
directory in your bundle and you want to

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.670
directory in your bundle and you want to make sure that they will be executed in

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680
make sure that they will be executed in

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.990
make sure that they will be executed in some particular order then you have

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000
some particular order then you have

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.190
some particular order then you have ordered fixture interface for this. Uh

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200
ordered fixture interface for this. Uh

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.590
ordered fixture interface for this. Uh and the third one is version fixture

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600
and the third one is version fixture

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.990
and the third one is version fixture interface and this is for you to be able

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000
interface and this is for you to be able

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.670
interface and this is for you to be able to load the same uh fixture multiple

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680
to load the same uh fixture multiple

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.350
to load the same uh fixture multiple times because by default it will be

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360
times because by default it will be

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.310
times because by default it will be loaded once. this fact will be uh noted

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320
loaded once. this fact will be uh noted

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.470
loaded once. this fact will be uh noted inside the database that this fixture

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480
inside the database that this fixture

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.550
inside the database that this fixture was already uh executed and uh you won't

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560
was already uh executed and uh you won't

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.509
was already uh executed and uh you won't be able to execute it again. Uh to do

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519
be able to execute it again. Uh to do

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:35.590
be able to execute it again. Uh to do that we have a ver version fixture

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600
that we have a ver version fixture

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:46.150
that we have a ver version fixture interface.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.070
Okay.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080
Okay.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.430
Okay. And basically for example for the email

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440
And basically for example for the email

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.710
And basically for example for the email templates. Okay. So we are loading email

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
templates. Okay. So we are loading email

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.190
templates. Okay. So we are loading email templates and then at some point your

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200
templates and then at some point your

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.990
templates and then at some point your customer might want to change the this

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000
customer might want to change the this

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.110
customer might want to change the this email template. Uh so you want to

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120
email template. Uh so you want to

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.870
email template. Uh so you want to basically

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880
basically

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.790
basically uh execute this particular fixture again

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800
uh execute this particular fixture again

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.110
uh execute this particular fixture again just change the um

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.870
the template for the email. Okay. So

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880
the template for the email. Okay. So

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.030
the template for the email. Okay. So this fixture is actually taking uh those

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
this fixture is actually taking uh those

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.509
this fixture is actually taking uh those files, those HTML twig files from here

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519
files, those HTML twig files from here

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.750
files, those HTML twig files from here and loading them. And this is my uh

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760
and loading them. And this is my uh

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.949
and loading them. And this is my uh email template. So when I do any change

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959
email template. So when I do any change

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.509
email template. So when I do any change here, I also need a way to be able to

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519
here, I also need a way to be able to

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.230
here, I also need a way to be able to execute this fixture once more. So for

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240
execute this fixture once more. So for

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.030
execute this fixture once more. So for this we have version fixture interface.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
this we have version fixture interface.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.590
this we have version fixture interface. Uh and here this interface forces you to

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600
Uh and here this interface forces you to

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.509
Uh and here this interface forces you to specify the get version method. And here

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519
specify the get version method. And here

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.910
specify the get version method. And here you just return one zero. Then if when

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920
you just return one zero. Then if when

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.470
you just return one zero. Then if when you change something in this template

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480
you change something in this template

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.110
you change something in this template you go to your fixture change it to one

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120
you go to your fixture change it to one

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.509
you go to your fixture change it to one one and then whenever you execute

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519
one and then whenever you execute

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:54.870
one and then whenever you execute appropriate command uh this fixture will

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880
appropriate command uh this fixture will

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.230
appropriate command uh this fixture will be loaded once more

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240
be loaded once more

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.590
be loaded once more and the command to load fixtures

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600
and the command to load fixtures

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.790
and the command to load fixtures is or migration data load. Uh this

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800
is or migration data load. Uh this

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.150
is or migration data load. Uh this command doesn't have any safe switch. So

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160
command doesn't have any safe switch. So

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.870
command doesn't have any safe switch. So it will be executed instantly whenever

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880
it will be executed instantly whenever

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.910
it will be executed instantly whenever you put it. But it also has this uh

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.750
dry run switch

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.750
run. Okay. So you can check what

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760
run. Okay. So you can check what

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.949
run. Okay. So you can check what fixtures will be executed if you execute

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959
fixtures will be executed if you execute

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:34.310
fixtures will be executed if you execute the command. none on my side because

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320
the command. none on my side because

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.750
the command. none on my side because everything is actually already executed

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760
everything is actually already executed

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.829
everything is actually already executed here.

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839
here.

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:43.269
here. Um and about demo data fixture idea is

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279
Um and about demo data fixture idea is

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:45.750
Um and about demo data fixture idea is exactly the same just the placing is

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760
exactly the same just the placing is

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.470
exactly the same just the placing is different and you need to execute the

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480
different and you need to execute the

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.350
different and you need to execute the command with this fixtures type demo

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360
command with this fixtures type demo

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.310
command with this fixtures type demo switch. Okay. So this will this command

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320
switch. Okay. So this will this command

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.870
switch. Okay. So this will this command will load your normal data fixtures and

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880
will load your normal data fixtures and

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.590
will load your normal data fixtures and if you want to load the demo data then

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600
if you want to load the demo data then

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.910
if you want to load the demo data then you need to specify this fixture type

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920
you need to specify this fixture type

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.110
you need to specify this fixture type demo switch and your uh demo data

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120
demo switch and your uh demo data

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.110
demo switch and your uh demo data fixtures uh needs to be inside

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120
fixtures uh needs to be inside

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.629
fixtures uh needs to be inside migrations data demo or okay so here we

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639
migrations data demo or okay so here we

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.829
migrations data demo or okay so here we had migrations data or and here we have

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
had migrations data or and here we have

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:18.069
had migrations data or and here we have migrations data demo or and file name is

00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079
migrations data demo or and file name is

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.990
migrations data demo or and file name is up to you

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000
up to you

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.629
up to you uh the the content of the data fixture

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639
uh the the content of the data fixture

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.470
uh the the content of the data fixture is exactly the same. It needs to extend

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480
is exactly the same. It needs to extend

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.870
is exactly the same. It needs to extend abstract fixture from doctrine and it

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880
abstract fixture from doctrine and it

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.590
abstract fixture from doctrine and it can have implement all those interfaces

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600
can have implement all those interfaces

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.710
can have implement all those interfaces too. Yeah.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720
too. Yeah.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.430
too. Yeah. Um I'm not sure

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440
Um I'm not sure

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.629
Um I'm not sure why this demo uh name space was added

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639
why this demo uh name space was added

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:45.990
why this demo uh name space was added uh why why it it exists

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000
uh why why it it exists

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.750
uh why why it it exists because you need to have two different

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760
because you need to have two different

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.990
because you need to have two different sets of fixtures. First are the normal

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000
sets of fixtures. First are the normal

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.949
sets of fixtures. First are the normal ones like when you want to install like

00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959
ones like when you want to install like

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.509
ones like when you want to install like clear aura application you still need to

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519
clear aura application you still need to

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:58.389
clear aura application you still need to have product units some default

00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399
have product units some default

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:01.750
have product units some default configuration options etc. But demo data

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760
configuration options etc. But demo data

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.430
configuration options etc. But demo data are those like additional data like here

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440
are those like additional data like here

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.829
are those like additional data like here on the training repository you installed

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839
on the training repository you installed

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:10.230
on the training repository you installed it with demo data and you have already

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240
it with demo data and you have already

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.150
it with demo data and you have already some customer users there some products

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160
some customer users there some products

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.030
some customer users there some products uh and that kind of data that in real

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040
uh and that kind of data that in real

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.790
uh and that kind of data that in real life when you start a project for your

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800
life when you start a project for your

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.230
life when you start a project for your client you will not want to have them.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240
client you will not want to have them.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.470
client you will not want to have them. Yeah. So um demo is installed only when

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480
Yeah. So um demo is installed only when

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.310
Yeah. So um demo is installed only when we

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320
we

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.829
we um

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839
um

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:32.710
um when we install with the demo data and

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720
when we install with the demo data and

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.750
when we install with the demo data and it's not executed otherwise

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760
it's not executed otherwise

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.870
it's not executed otherwise uh or if you manually load migrations

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880
uh or if you manually load migrations

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.269
uh or if you manually load migrations with this command and also add this

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279
with this command and also add this

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.269
with this command and also add this switch

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279
switch

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.509
switch so it will also load you so you can

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519
so it will also load you so you can

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.069
so it will also load you so you can install application without demo data

00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079
install application without demo data

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.590
install application without demo data and they say okay I may need demo data

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600
and they say okay I may need demo data

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.350
and they say okay I may need demo data so you exit execute this command with

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360
so you exit execute this command with

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.829
so you exit execute this command with this switch and then the demo data will

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839
this switch and then the demo data will

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.829
this switch and then the demo data will be added to your project.

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839
be added to your project.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.269
be added to your project. Yeah. And it will execute

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279
Yeah. And it will execute

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:04.629
Yeah. And it will execute uh migration for all bundles. So all

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639
uh migration for all bundles. So all

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.509
uh migration for all bundles. So all demo data of each bundle will be loaded.

00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519
demo data of each bundle will be loaded.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:07.910
demo data of each bundle will be loaded. Correct.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920
Correct.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.750
Correct. Mhm. Yes. Probably there is a switch to

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760
Mhm. Yes. Probably there is a switch to

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.069
Mhm. Yes. Probably there is a switch to uh specify

00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079
uh specify

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:17.189
uh specify for each of our commands. We also have a

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199
for each of our commands. We also have a

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:18.710
for each of our commands. We also have a help

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720
help

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.670
help switch. So you can specify bundles by

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680
switch. So you can specify bundles by

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.829
switch. So you can specify bundles by the bundle

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839
the bundle

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.389
the bundle uh switch like here. So you can also

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399
uh switch like here. So you can also

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.629
uh switch like here. So you can also load only from some particular bundle.

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639
load only from some particular bundle.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.949
load only from some particular bundle. For demo data from core this might not

00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959
For demo data from core this might not

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.910
For demo data from core this might not be the best idea because as I shown you

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920
be the best idea because as I shown you

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.870
be the best idea because as I shown you they are related to each other. They are

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
they are related to each other. They are

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.509
they are related to each other. They are dependent to each other. So in

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519
dependent to each other. So in

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:41.030
dependent to each other. So in organization bundle there will be

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040
organization bundle there will be

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.949
organization bundle there will be organization loaded and then in user

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959
organization loaded and then in user

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.870
organization loaded and then in user bundle there will be users loaded. So

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880
bundle there will be users loaded. So

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.949
bundle there will be users loaded. So maybe this is not the best idea, but for

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959
maybe this is not the best idea, but for

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.110
maybe this is not the best idea, but for your custom bundle,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120
your custom bundle,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.949
your custom bundle, there is always a way to execute only

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959
there is always a way to execute only

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:57.910
there is always a way to execute only demo data from some specific bundle

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.949
by default all bundles.

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:07.910
Okay.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920
Okay.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.389
Okay. uh documentation for the future

00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399
uh documentation for the future

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:13.350
uh documentation for the future reference uh to actually everything that

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360
reference uh to actually everything that

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.629
reference uh to actually everything that we talked about during this topic.

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639
we talked about during this topic.

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:21.910
we talked about during this topic. um and a little bit of best practices.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920
um and a little bit of best practices.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.069
um and a little bit of best practices. Uh so basically when you create a custom

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079
Uh so basically when you create a custom

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.230
Uh so basically when you create a custom entity and we'll do it dur during the

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240
entity and we'll do it dur during the

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.350
entity and we'll do it dur during the practice just create the the fields

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360
practice just create the the fields

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.430
practice just create the the fields normally right because you have access

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440
normally right because you have access

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.949
normally right because you have access to src you create the entity class so

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959
to src you create the entity class so

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:36.949
to src you create the entity class so basically all all those fields should be

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959
basically all all those fields should be

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:39.430
basically all all those fields should be just standard doctrine fields only if

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440
just standard doctrine fields only if

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.230
just standard doctrine fields only if you want to create a field on existing

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240
you want to create a field on existing

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.629
you want to create a field on existing entity in core then you cannot do it

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639
entity in core then you cannot do it

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:47.269
entity in core then you cannot do it this way. So only then use uh please use

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279
this way. So only then use uh please use

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.990
this way. So only then use uh please use the extended uh entities functionality.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000
the extended uh entities functionality.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.749
the extended uh entities functionality. Uh if you not need birectional relations

00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759
Uh if you not need birectional relations

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.590
Uh if you not need birectional relations also you can do it with extended

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600
also you can do it with extended

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.350
also you can do it with extended relations. So you remember that we have

00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360
relations. So you remember that we have

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.749
relations. So you remember that we have actually always two methods. Uh one is

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759
actually always two methods. Uh one is

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.310
actually always two methods. Uh one is to add relation and then to add inverse

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320
to add relation and then to add inverse

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.710
to add relation and then to add inverse relation. So remember that if you want

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720
relation. So remember that if you want

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.269
relation. So remember that if you want both ways then you need to actually

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279
both ways then you need to actually

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:13.509
both ways then you need to actually execute two methods.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:17.269
Uh this is some general uh best practice

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279
Uh this is some general uh best practice

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:20.790
Uh this is some general uh best practice maybe not for this topic actually but in

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800
maybe not for this topic actually but in

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.470
maybe not for this topic actually but in general uh for working with entities

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480
general uh for working with entities

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.030
general uh for working with entities uh working with entities can be because

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040
uh working with entities can be because

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.189
uh working with entities can be because we're using doctrine uh we're using

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199
we're using doctrine uh we're using

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:31.110
we're using doctrine uh we're using object hydration

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120
object hydration

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.590
object hydration uh there. So this can sometimes be slow.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600
uh there. So this can sometimes be slow.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.710
uh there. So this can sometimes be slow. Uh so for example for some imports when

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720
Uh so for example for some imports when

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.590
Uh so for example for some imports when there is a lot of data we sometimes

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600
there is a lot of data we sometimes

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.670
there is a lot of data we sometimes switch and use plain SQL there but I'm

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680
switch and use plain SQL there but I'm

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.269
switch and use plain SQL there but I'm not sure if you'll encounter this

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279
not sure if you'll encounter this

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:49.509
not sure if you'll encounter this situation anytime soon. So that's just

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519
situation anytime soon. So that's just

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.069
situation anytime soon. So that's just some general idea.

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079
some general idea.

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:55.430
some general idea. Uh so yes we use uh doctrine object

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440
Uh so yes we use uh doctrine object

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.430
Uh so yes we use uh doctrine object hydration. So the first step will be to

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440
hydration. So the first step will be to

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.629
hydration. So the first step will be to switch uh to array hydration

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639
switch uh to array hydration

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:03.829
switch uh to array hydration uh and then not even use this but use

00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839
uh and then not even use this but use

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:06.309
uh and then not even use this but use plain SQL if you still have performance

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319
plain SQL if you still have performance

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.710
plain SQL if you still have performance issues.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720
issues.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.829
issues. Uh and uh just as a reminder that if

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839
Uh and uh just as a reminder that if

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.590
Uh and uh just as a reminder that if you'd like to modify some doctrine

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600
you'd like to modify some doctrine

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.470
you'd like to modify some doctrine annotations, some doctrine metadata

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480
annotations, some doctrine metadata

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.470
annotations, some doctrine metadata uh and by doctrine annotations I'm

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480
uh and by doctrine annotations I'm

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.029
uh and by doctrine annotations I'm talking about all those elements

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.870
uh here. So those are doctrine

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880
uh here. So those are doctrine

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.710
uh here. So those are doctrine annotations entity table and those

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720
annotations entity table and those

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.390
annotations entity table and those columns

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400
columns

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.630
columns this if you'd like to change anything

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640
this if you'd like to change anything

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.270
this if you'd like to change anything from this inside existing object because

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280
from this inside existing object because

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.430
from this inside existing object because you cannot go to vendor files and edit

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440
you cannot go to vendor files and edit

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.390
you cannot go to vendor files and edit for example this file. So if you want to

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400
for example this file. So if you want to

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.710
for example this file. So if you want to uh change it you need to do it with a

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720
uh change it you need to do it with a

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.350
uh change it you need to do it with a listener and uh where's my last slide?

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360
listener and uh where's my last slide?

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.350
listener and uh where's my last slide? There is this load class metadata event

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360
There is this load class metadata event

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.070
There is this load class metadata event that will give you all the metadata for

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080
that will give you all the metadata for

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.909
that will give you all the metadata for this class. All doctrine metadata for

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919
this class. All doctrine metadata for

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.430
this class. All doctrine metadata for this class. So you'll be basically able

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440
this class. So you'll be basically able

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.870
this class. So you'll be basically able to change anything.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.830
Okay. Do you have any questions?

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.070
Okay. Now I have actually a question for

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080
Okay. Now I have actually a question for

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.909
Okay. Now I have actually a question for you. Uh so for today uh we have the

00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919
you. Uh so for today uh we have the

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:20.070
you. Uh so for today uh we have the first part will be the practice for this

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080
first part will be the practice for this

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.669
first part will be the practice for this topic that I just finished. Uh and it

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679
topic that I just finished. Uh and it

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.230
topic that I just finished. Uh and it will take like about two and a half up

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240
will take like about two and a half up

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.990
will take like about two and a half up to three hours and then we have one

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000
to three hours and then we have one

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.310
to three hours and then we have one theory topic about data grid index page

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320
theory topic about data grid index page

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.430
theory topic about data grid index page and many to do. Uh but basically we can

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440
and many to do. Uh but basically we can

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.590
and many to do. Uh but basically we can go one way or the other. So we can start

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600
go one way or the other. So we can start

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.909
go one way or the other. So we can start from practice and then at the very end

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919
from practice and then at the very end

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:45.029
from practice and then at the very end of today's training do the uh do the

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039
of today's training do the uh do the

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:47.909
of today's training do the uh do the theory or we can switch it if you prefer

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919
theory or we can switch it if you prefer

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.750
theory or we can switch it if you prefer and I can do the theory now and then

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760
and I can do the theory now and then

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.590
and I can do the theory now and then we'll just do the practice till the end

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600
we'll just do the practice till the end

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.590
we'll just do the practice till the end of the meeting. Uh why I'm asking

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600
of the meeting. Uh why I'm asking

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.110
of the meeting. Uh why I'm asking because that's actually totally up to

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120
because that's actually totally up to

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.990
because that's actually totally up to you. For me, both ways are fine. And I

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000
you. For me, both ways are fine. And I

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.669
you. For me, both ways are fine. And I also know that some of you uh from

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679
also know that some of you uh from

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.150
also know that some of you uh from Falcrum, you decided to do the practice

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160
Falcrum, you decided to do the practice

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.470
Falcrum, you decided to do the practice sessions on your site outside of the

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480
sessions on your site outside of the

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:14.070
sessions on your site outside of the training. So you can just then

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080
training. So you can just then

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.390
training. So you can just then go after I finish the theory session.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400
go after I finish the theory session.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.549
go after I finish the theory session. So guys, I need your decision. For me,

00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559
So guys, I need your decision. For me,

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:26.470
So guys, I need your decision. For me, it's both ways. It's fine.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.750
So I think hey so I think if you can

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760
So I think hey so I think if you can

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.470
So I think hey so I think if you can finish the theory session that would be

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480
finish the theory session that would be

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.909
finish the theory session that would be great because I want to join one other

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919
great because I want to join one other

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:39.669
great because I want to join one other other meeting uh in uh one and one one

00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679
other meeting uh in uh one and one one

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.310
other meeting uh in uh one and one one and a half an hour. So that would be

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320
and a half an hour. So that would be

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.870
and a half an hour. So that would be great if if everybody is fine then only.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880
great if if everybody is fine then only.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.750
great if if everybody is fine then only. Mhm. Okay. So we have two

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.270
Okay. So we have three votes for yes.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280
Okay. So we have three votes for yes.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.350
Okay. So we have three votes for yes. Okay. Democracy.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360
Okay. Democracy.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.070
Okay. Democracy. So let's do the theory.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080
So let's do the theory.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.590
So let's do the theory. Um

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600
Um

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.909
Um okay.

00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919
okay.

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:07.830
okay. So the theory topic will be kind of

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840
So the theory topic will be kind of

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.190
So the theory topic will be kind of continue this uh all this

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200
continue this uh all this

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.870
continue this uh all this uh so whenever we have our entity

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880
uh so whenever we have our entity

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.909
uh so whenever we have our entity uh then we want to display it somewhere

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919
uh then we want to display it somewhere

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.909
uh then we want to display it somewhere and the first part will be actually our

00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919
and the first part will be actually our

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:24.549
and the first part will be actually our index page. Uh so on the index page we

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559
index page. Uh so on the index page we

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:27.669
index page. Uh so on the index page we always have a list in back office

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679
always have a list in back office

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:29.909
always have a list in back office actually we always have a list of our

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919
actually we always have a list of our

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:32.630
actually we always have a list of our entities. So for this we will need to

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640
entities. So for this we will need to

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.750
entities. So for this we will need to have few elements. Uh first we need to

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760
have few elements. Uh first we need to

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.909
have few elements. Uh first we need to create this index page and for this we

00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919
create this index page and for this we

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:40.710
create this index page and for this we need a template we need controller and

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720
need a template we need controller and

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.590
need a template we need controller and action in this controller.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600
action in this controller.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.590
action in this controller. um

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600
um

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.750
um on this index page we need some

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760
on this index page we need some

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.830
on this index page we need some representation of the list and for this

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840
representation of the list and for this

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.029
representation of the list and for this this for us this will be data grid and

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039
this for us this will be data grid and

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:55.110
this for us this will be data grid and then to be able to access this index

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120
then to be able to access this index

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.310
then to be able to access this index page we need a menu element so we'll be

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320
page we need a menu element so we'll be

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.149
page we need a menu element so we'll be able just to click somewhere and not

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159
able just to click somewhere and not

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.549
able just to click somewhere and not type the URL

00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559
type the URL

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.789
type the URL uh so that's basically the whole idea of

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799
uh so that's basically the whole idea of

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.950
uh so that's basically the whole idea of this uh topic

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960
this uh topic

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.029
this uh topic so we're going to start from the data

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039
so we're going to start from the data

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.870
so we're going to start from the data grids

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880
grids

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.029
grids uh yeah so we already know that For us

00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039
uh yeah so we already know that For us

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:15.430
uh yeah so we already know that For us the data grid it's our representation of

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440
the data grid it's our representation of

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.190
the data grid it's our representation of a list of uh entities. So basically in

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200
a list of uh entities. So basically in

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.430
a list of uh entities. So basically in general data grid what's is implemented

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440
general data grid what's is implemented

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.669
general data grid what's is implemented the way that this can be uh a

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679
the way that this can be uh a

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:26.470
the way that this can be uh a representation of any data from any data

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480
representation of any data from any data

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.390
representation of any data from any data data source. So we have some default

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400
data source. So we have some default

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.710
data source. So we have some default data sources. This can be all RAM which

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720
data sources. This can be all RAM which

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.510
data sources. This can be all RAM which means database. So we're fetching

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520
means database. So we're fetching

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.149
means database. So we're fetching entities to our data grid from the

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159
entities to our data grid from the

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:39.590
entities to our data grid from the database. Uh then we have also search.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600
database. Uh then we have also search.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.110
database. Uh then we have also search. So we'll be fetching um entity store

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120
So we'll be fetching um entity store

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.430
So we'll be fetching um entity store data grid from the search index and this

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
data grid from the search index and this

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.669
data grid from the search index and this is exactly what's h what is happening on

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679
is exactly what's h what is happening on

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.390
is exactly what's h what is happening on the storefront the PLP so product list

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400
the storefront the PLP so product list

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.870
the storefront the PLP so product list page category pages search results

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
page category pages search results

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.110
page category pages search results everything this doesn't look like a data

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120
everything this doesn't look like a data

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.029
everything this doesn't look like a data grid that I will show you in a moment

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039
grid that I will show you in a moment

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.029
grid that I will show you in a moment but believe me behind this there is a

00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039
but believe me behind this there is a

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:01.430
but believe me behind this there is a data grid just very very much customized

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440
data grid just very very much customized

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.110
data grid just very very much customized one uh but behind this there is a data

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120
one uh but behind this there is a data

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.870
one uh but behind this there is a data grid that has a data source uh taken

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880
grid that has a data source uh taken

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.029
grid that has a data source uh taken from search index and then also you can

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039
from search index and then also you can

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.110
from search index and then also you can have a type array. So basically you can

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120
have a type array. So basically you can

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.190
have a type array. So basically you can pass any array there in displayed.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200
pass any array there in displayed.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.750
pass any array there in displayed. Um so this data grid uh has

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
Um so this data grid uh has

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.990
Um so this data grid uh has implementation in our or our data grid

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000
implementation in our or our data grid

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.950
implementation in our or our data grid bundle. Um so to be able to display it

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960
bundle. Um so to be able to display it

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.830
bundle. Um so to be able to display it you just need to pass the configuration.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840
you just need to pass the configuration.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.870
you just need to pass the configuration. So this data grid needs to know how to

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880
So this data grid needs to know how to

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.270
So this data grid needs to know how to for example for the ORAM source and for

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280
for example for the ORAM source and for

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.029
for example for the ORAM source and for the uh search needs to know how to build

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039
the uh search needs to know how to build

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:43.510
the uh search needs to know how to build the query to fetch the data to the data

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520
the query to fetch the data to the data

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.830
the query to fetch the data to the data grid. So we will have the query section

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840
grid. So we will have the query section

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.310
grid. So we will have the query section and also we will have sections uh for

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320
and also we will have sections uh for

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.909
and also we will have sections uh for example for the columns we need to

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919
example for the columns we need to

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.830
example for the columns we need to specify what columns will be in the data

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840
specify what columns will be in the data

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.549
specify what columns will be in the data grid what filters will be in the data

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559
grid what filters will be in the data

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:57.110
grid what filters will be in the data grid what sortters if you want to enable

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120
grid what sortters if you want to enable

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.070
grid what sortters if you want to enable disable pagionation and so on. And then

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080
disable pagionation and so on. And then

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.230
disable pagionation and so on. And then also on the data grid we have single

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240
also on the data grid we have single

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.110
also on the data grid we have single actions and mass actions. So let me show

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120
actions and mass actions. So let me show

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.789
actions and mass actions. So let me show you this contact grid.

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.870
So this is basically our data grid. This

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880
So this is basically our data grid. This

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.510
So this is basically our data grid. This is how it looks by default. Uh we have

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520
is how it looks by default. Uh we have

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.830
is how it looks by default. Uh we have columns. Uh we have filters here.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840
columns. Uh we have filters here.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.549
columns. Uh we have filters here. Based on the filter type it will be um

00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559
Based on the filter type it will be um

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.310
Based on the filter type it will be um different here when I click on it. So

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320
different here when I click on it. So

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.029
different here when I click on it. So this is a string. Uh so we have this way

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039
this is a string. Uh so we have this way

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:30.470
this is a string. Uh so we have this way of rendering it. But for tax we have

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480
of rendering it. But for tax we have

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.590
of rendering it. But for tax we have different for created at this state

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600
different for created at this state

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.310
different for created at this state time. So we have just different um box

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320
time. So we have just different um box

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.669
time. So we have just different um box rendered based on the filter type. Uh

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679
rendered based on the filter type. Uh

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:44.149
rendered based on the filter type. Uh then we have also sortters and sorters

00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159
then we have also sortters and sorters

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:46.950
then we have also sortters and sorters are here by clicking the

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960
are here by clicking the

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.549
are here by clicking the heater.

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559
heater.

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:51.510
heater. Obviously we have columns as you can see

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520
Obviously we have columns as you can see

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.990
Obviously we have columns as you can see we have pager here at the top. Uh we

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000
we have pager here at the top. Uh we

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.990
we have pager here at the top. Uh we have pages

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000
have pages

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.510
have pages records per page. We can hide show

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520
records per page. We can hide show

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.110
records per page. We can hide show filters. This is to refresh the grid but

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120
filters. This is to refresh the grid but

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.230
filters. This is to refresh the grid but according to current uh filtered

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240
according to current uh filtered

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.990
according to current uh filtered elements. So let's say

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000
elements. So let's say

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.390
elements. So let's say I will filter it and here I will just

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400
I will filter it and here I will just

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.390
I will filter it and here I will just refresh it. But with those filters if

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400
refresh it. But with those filters if

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.070
refresh it. But with those filters if you want to reset it to default state

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080
you want to reset it to default state

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.710
you want to reset it to default state then there is this third button here

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720
then there is this third button here

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.029
then there is this third button here says reset to default.

00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039
says reset to default.

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:25.510
says reset to default. And then for some data grids we have

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520
And then for some data grids we have

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.149
And then for some data grids we have really plenty of columns here but they

00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159
really plenty of columns here but they

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:30.789
really plenty of columns here but they are not all displayed

00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799
are not all displayed

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:32.870
are not all displayed right now otherwise this will look just

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880
right now otherwise this will look just

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.350
right now otherwise this will look just ugly and will be unreadable.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360
ugly and will be unreadable.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.269
ugly and will be unreadable. So we also have this configuration

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279
So we also have this configuration

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:39.510
So we also have this configuration section here where you have two tabs

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520
section here where you have two tabs

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.310
section here where you have two tabs grid and filters and for the grid you

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320
grid and filters and for the grid you

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.710
grid and filters and for the grid you can turn or on or off some additional

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720
can turn or on or off some additional

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.029
can turn or on or off some additional columns. So as you can see we have a lot

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039
columns. So as you can see we have a lot

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.710
columns. So as you can see we have a lot of them but not all of them are

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720
of them but not all of them are

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.909
of them but not all of them are displayed but I can start displaying

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919
displayed but I can start displaying

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:55.510
displayed but I can start displaying some column. Okay and it appeared here.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520
some column. Okay and it appeared here.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.909
some column. Okay and it appeared here. Uh same for filters. Usually we have a

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919
Uh same for filters. Usually we have a

00:24:57.919 --> 00:24:59.830
Uh same for filters. Usually we have a lot of filters configured for data grid

00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840
lot of filters configured for data grid

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.149
lot of filters configured for data grid but not all of them are rendered

00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159
but not all of them are rendered

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:04.710
but not all of them are rendered instantly. So we can always come here

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720
instantly. So we can always come here

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.830
instantly. So we can always come here and show some filter.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.430
Um okay and actions. Uh so our row

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440
Um okay and actions. Uh so our row

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.669
Um okay and actions. Uh so our row actions are here under those three dot

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679
actions are here under those three dot

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:18.230
actions are here under those three dot do dots. So it's usually view, edit and

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240
do dots. So it's usually view, edit and

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.909
do dots. So it's usually view, edit and delete. And also we have mass actions

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919
delete. And also we have mass actions

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:25.350
delete. And also we have mass actions that they are here on the hither level.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360
that they are here on the hither level.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.990
that they are here on the hither level. For the contact entity it's merge and

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000
For the contact entity it's merge and

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.149
For the contact entity it's merge and delete. And then you have check boxes

00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159
delete. And then you have check boxes

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:33.190
delete. And then you have check boxes here. So you can check multiple and for

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200
here. So you can check multiple and for

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.909
here. So you can check multiple and for all of them click for example delete.

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:39.909
Uh

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919
Uh

00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:42.870
Uh and we also have views. So you can

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880
and we also have views. So you can

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.149
and we also have views. So you can create views. Uh so basically the

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159
create views. Uh so basically the

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:48.549
create views. Uh so basically the default by default we see all the

00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559
default by default we see all the

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:51.029
default by default we see all the contacts but we can also switch to some

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039
contacts but we can also switch to some

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:56.070
contacts but we can also switch to some different uh contacts for for example um

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080
different uh contacts for for example um

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.430
different uh contacts for for example um I'm a salesman who only wants to see

00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440
I'm a salesman who only wants to see

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.269
I'm a salesman who only wants to see misery contacts. Okay. So I'm filtering

00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279
misery contacts. Okay. So I'm filtering

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:06.950
misery contacts. Okay. So I'm filtering it like here. So I don't need to every

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960
it like here. So I don't need to every

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.590
it like here. So I don't need to every day just come here and filter it by

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600
day just come here and filter it by

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.789
day just come here and filter it by state. I can switch the view by one

00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799
state. I can switch the view by one

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:15.029
state. I can switch the view by one click and that's it. And even more if

00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039
click and that's it. And even more if

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.269
click and that's it. And even more if I'm sure that that's my I even can make

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279
I'm sure that that's my I even can make

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:19.909
I'm sure that that's my I even can make this my default view. So here in the

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919
this my default view. So here in the

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:22.070
this my default view. So here in the options you can also set this as

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080
options you can also set this as

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.909
options you can also set this as default. Then whenever I enter the

00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919
default. Then whenever I enter the

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.549
default. Then whenever I enter the contacts grid I will always see this

00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559
contacts grid I will always see this

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:29.430
contacts grid I will always see this particular view.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440
particular view.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:37.269
particular view. Okay. I'll switch to all contacts. Uh

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:44.630
yeah, that's basically it.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.310
Okay.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320
Okay.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.190
Okay. Uh so how to create this grid? We will

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200
Uh so how to create this grid? We will

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.110
Uh so how to create this grid? We will have uh few sections. First part will be

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120
have uh few sections. First part will be

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.549
have uh few sections. First part will be or so. So here we will uh or query. So

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559
or so. So here we will uh or query. So

00:26:56.559 --> 00:27:00.549
or so. So here we will uh or query. So here we will specify uh what to select

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559
here we will specify uh what to select

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.110
here we will specify uh what to select from to our data grid. So we need to

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120
from to our data grid. So we need to

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.430
from to our data grid. So we need to select part from where group by or

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440
select part from where group by or

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.190
select part from where group by or whatever. Sometimes it will be just

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200
whatever. Sometimes it will be just

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.950
whatever. Sometimes it will be just select and from sometimes you will have

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960
select and from sometimes you will have

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.110
select and from sometimes you will have some word statement.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120
some word statement.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.909
some word statement. And then we will display columns and for

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919
And then we will display columns and for

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:16.470
And then we will display columns and for the column uh you need to specify the

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480
the column uh you need to specify the

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.070
the column uh you need to specify the label.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080
label.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.830
label. Label will be used for the heater of

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840
Label will be used for the heater of

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.269
Label will be used for the heater of this column.

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:30.310
Um and if you the label is enough then

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320
Um and if you the label is enough then

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.029
Um and if you the label is enough then we will just display in the cell the

00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039
we will just display in the cell the

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:36.230
we will just display in the cell the value for this particular field on your

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240
value for this particular field on your

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.510
value for this particular field on your entity. But you can also specify some

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520
entity. But you can also specify some

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.470
entity. But you can also specify some different front end type and instead of

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480
different front end type and instead of

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.870
different front end type and instead of displaying

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880
displaying

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.310
displaying just row value here you can for example

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320
just row value here you can for example

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.029
just row value here you can for example even display it with some HTML tweak

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039
even display it with some HTML tweak

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:53.430
even display it with some HTML tweak template. Right? So this can be not just

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440
template. Right? So this can be not just

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.070
template. Right? So this can be not just a value but this can be also displayed

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080
a value but this can be also displayed

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.630
a value but this can be also displayed with some custom template I mean the

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640
with some custom template I mean the

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.190
with some custom template I mean the cell I have example in here. So I will

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200
cell I have example in here. So I will

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.149
cell I have example in here. So I will show you in a moment how to do this. And

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159
show you in a moment how to do this. And

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:07.350
show you in a moment how to do this. And then we have a filter section and for

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360
then we have a filter section and for

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.430
then we have a filter section and for filters we need to specify the type for

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440
filters we need to specify the type for

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.750
filters we need to specify the type for the filter and data name. This is uh

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760
the filter and data name. This is uh

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.710
the filter and data name. This is uh the name of the

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720
the name of the

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.830
the name of the data that we will filter by.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840
data that we will filter by.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.110
data that we will filter by. So for example if we want to I will show

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120
So for example if we want to I will show

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.950
So for example if we want to I will show an example in a moment it will become

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960
an example in a moment it will become

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.909
an example in a moment it will become clearer for sorters uh the same we need

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919
clearer for sorters uh the same we need

00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:30.789
clearer for sorters uh the same we need to specify the data that we will sort by

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799
to specify the data that we will sort by

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.669
to specify the data that we will sort by and then uh here we can also specify the

00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679
and then uh here we can also specify the

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:37.510
and then uh here we can also specify the default sort for the data grid. Uh we

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520
default sort for the data grid. Uh we

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.750
default sort for the data grid. Uh we have also section for properties. They

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760
have also section for properties. They

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.350
have also section for properties. They can be used for example in actions. Uh

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360
can be used for example in actions. Uh

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.909
can be used for example in actions. Uh for example to display the view page of

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919
for example to display the view page of

00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:48.310
for example to display the view page of this particular record. We need to pass

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320
this particular record. We need to pass

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.870
this particular record. We need to pass the ID of this record right because when

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880
the ID of this record right because when

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.190
the ID of this record right because when I click and open view page um we need to

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200
I click and open view page um we need to

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.110
I click and open view page um we need to know exactly what record to view and we

00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120
know exactly what record to view and we

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.389
know exactly what record to view and we need its ID and this will need to be

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399
need its ID and this will need to be

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:05.830
need its ID and this will need to be specified inside the properties. And

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840
specified inside the properties. And

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.750
specified inside the properties. And then we have sections for single actions

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760
then we have sections for single actions

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.990
then we have sections for single actions and mass actions.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000
and mass actions.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.430
and mass actions. Uh yeah, I will show you now the simple

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440
Uh yeah, I will show you now the simple

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.510
Uh yeah, I will show you now the simple example of a data grid. Um and similar

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520
example of a data grid. Um and similar

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.430
example of a data grid. Um and similar very similar to the one that we'll do in

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440
very similar to the one that we'll do in

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.630
very similar to the one that we'll do in the practice session. So data grid

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640
the practice session. So data grid

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.510
the practice session. So data grid configuration sits inside data grid yam

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520
configuration sits inside data grid yam

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.190
configuration sits inside data grid yam file and it's inside resources config or

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200
file and it's inside resources config or

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.549
file and it's inside resources config or So because it's inside or

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559
So because it's inside or

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.190
So because it's inside or directory you can be sure that this is

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200
directory you can be sure that this is

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.350
directory you can be sure that this is automatically loaded

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360
automatically loaded

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.669
automatically loaded by one of our bundles actually or data

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679
by one of our bundles actually or data

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:43.029
by one of our bundles actually or data grid bundle. Um so all you need to do is

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039
grid bundle. Um so all you need to do is

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:45.110
grid bundle. Um so all you need to do is create this data grid yam file and put

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120
create this data grid yam file and put

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.549
create this data grid yam file and put the configuration there.

00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559
the configuration there.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:51.350
the configuration there. So let's see the example

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360
So let's see the example

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.830
So let's see the example inside this file

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840
inside this file

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.870
inside this file uh under the data grids name space then

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880
uh under the data grids name space then

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.950
uh under the data grids name space then we can specify the list of data grids.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960
we can specify the list of data grids.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.350
we can specify the list of data grids. So first line this is my data grid

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360
So first line this is my data grid

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.669
So first line this is my data grid identifier the name of my data grid this

00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679
identifier the name of my data grid this

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.830
identifier the name of my data grid this needs to be unique.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840
needs to be unique.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.710
needs to be unique. Um and as you can see we have some

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720
Um and as you can see we have some

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.310
Um and as you can see we have some naming conventions to make sure that

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320
naming conventions to make sure that

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.950
naming conventions to make sure that this is unique. Uh so for example I'm

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960
this is unique. Uh so for example I'm

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.549
this is unique. Uh so for example I'm sure that this will be just list of

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559
sure that this will be just list of

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.710
sure that this will be just list of payment terms.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720
payment terms.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.590
payment terms. Let's see payment terms.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.350
Okay. So as you can see this data grid

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360
Okay. So as you can see this data grid

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.070
Okay. So as you can see this data grid is indeed very

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080
is indeed very

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.710
is indeed very small. So we basically have a data grid

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720
small. So we basically have a data grid

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.750
small. So we basically have a data grid with one column, one sortter, one filter

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760
with one column, one sortter, one filter

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.789
with one column, one sortter, one filter and uh actions viewed and delete.

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799
and uh actions viewed and delete.

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.710
and uh actions viewed and delete. So to do this simple data grid we need

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720
So to do this simple data grid we need

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.669
So to do this simple data grid we need to specify the name of the data grid.

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679
to specify the name of the data grid.

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:52.230
to specify the name of the data grid. Then we didn't talk about ACL yet. We'll

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240
Then we didn't talk about ACL yet. We'll

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.789
Then we didn't talk about ACL yet. We'll have separate ACL topic. But for now

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799
have separate ACL topic. But for now

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:56.549
have separate ACL topic. But for now just for you to know that you can

00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559
just for you to know that you can

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:59.350
just for you to know that you can protect uh this data grid with some ACL.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360
protect uh this data grid with some ACL.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.350
protect uh this data grid with some ACL. And if I don't have this particular

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360
And if I don't have this particular

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.750
And if I don't have this particular permission I will not see this data

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760
permission I will not see this data

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.470
permission I will not see this data grid. And then the very important part

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480
grid. And then the very important part

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.789
grid. And then the very important part is extended entity name. So uh we are

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799
is extended entity name. So uh we are

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:13.269
is extended entity name. So uh we are saying that this grid this will be a

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279
saying that this grid this will be a

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:15.190
saying that this grid this will be a list of

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200
list of

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.269
list of those entities.

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279
those entities.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:21.269
those entities. Okay. And because of this later when you

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279
Okay. And because of this later when you

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.750
Okay. And because of this later when you extend the payment term entity and add

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760
extend the payment term entity and add

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.669
extend the payment term entity and add some fields on it this data grid will

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679
some fields on it this data grid will

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:29.990
some fields on it this data grid will out of the box have this additional

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000
out of the box have this additional

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.990
out of the box have this additional field for you too. So as you remember

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000
field for you too. So as you remember

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.590
field for you too. So as you remember from yesterday when I shown you the

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600
from yesterday when I shown you the

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.389
from yesterday when I shown you the migrations and the extended entities

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399
migrations and the extended entities

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.549
migrations and the extended entities functionality if you just create a

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559
functionality if you just create a

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:41.750
functionality if you just create a migration and add field specify is

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760
migration and add field specify is

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.389
migration and add field specify is extend true and owner custom a lot of

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399
extend true and owner custom a lot of

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.310
extend true and owner custom a lot of elements will be automatically generated

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320
elements will be automatically generated

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.750
elements will be automatically generated for you. One of them was that this field

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760
for you. One of them was that this field

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.470
for you. One of them was that this field will be visible as a column on a data

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480
will be visible as a column on a data

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.909
will be visible as a column on a data grid and for this you need to specify

00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919
grid and for this you need to specify

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:58.470
grid and for this you need to specify this extended entity name. Right now

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480
this extended entity name. Right now

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.509
this extended entity name. Right now this data grid is ready to display some

00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519
this data grid is ready to display some

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.789
this data grid is ready to display some dynamic fields for you.

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799
dynamic fields for you.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:08.549
dynamic fields for you. Uh we can use ORM hints, query hints, we

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559
Uh we can use ORM hints, query hints, we

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.110
Uh we can use ORM hints, query hints, we can use entity pageionation. The

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120
can use entity pageionation. The

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.830
can use entity pageionation. The important part source the most important

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840
important part source the most important

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.350
important part source the most important part.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360
part.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.789
part. Um so basically type is or this can be

00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799
Um so basically type is or this can be

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:22.149
Um so basically type is or this can be search this can be array and then we

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159
search this can be array and then we

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.350
search this can be array and then we have query section when we specify what

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360
have query section when we specify what

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.549
have query section when we specify what fields we want to select and from where

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559
fields we want to select and from where

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.870
fields we want to select and from where okay and from we define exactly this

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880
okay and from we define exactly this

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.990
okay and from we define exactly this way. So under the table you actually put

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000
way. So under the table you actually put

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.230
way. So under the table you actually put the fully qualified class name of our

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240
the fully qualified class name of our

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.190
the fully qualified class name of our entity and then you want to fetch it

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200
entity and then you want to fetch it

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.269
entity and then you want to fetch it with some alias. This alias now is used

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279
with some alias. This alias now is used

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:43.509
with some alias. This alias now is used in my select statement to fetch

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519
in my select statement to fetch

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:47.430
in my select statement to fetch appropriate fields from this entity.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440
appropriate fields from this entity.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.149
appropriate fields from this entity. Then in the columns section we have only

00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159
Then in the columns section we have only

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:53.269
Then in the columns section we have only one column and this looks weird because

00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279
one column and this looks weird because

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:54.789
one column and this looks weird because we have label label but this is

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799
we have label label but this is

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:56.710
we have label label but this is basically the name of the column. So if

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720
basically the name of the column. So if

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.310
basically the name of the column. So if this would be title or name or

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320
this would be title or name or

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.990
this would be title or name or something. So this will be it and this

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000
something. So this will be it and this

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.230
something. So this will be it and this goes directly to this

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240
goes directly to this

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.750
goes directly to this part from select. Then uh the label

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760
part from select. Then uh the label

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.669
part from select. Then uh the label variable inside the column this is

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679
variable inside the column this is

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:17.430
variable inside the column this is actually the column title.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440
actually the column title.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.509
actually the column title. So this here

00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519
So this here

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:23.830
So this here um okay

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840
um okay

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.909
um okay about properties in a second. Then we

00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919
about properties in a second. Then we

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:28.230
about properties in a second. Then we have sortters and we have we are

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240
have sortters and we have we are

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.909
have sortters and we have we are sorttering only sorting sorting only by

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919
sorttering only sorting sorting only by

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:35.830
sorttering only sorting sorting only by the label uh column

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840
the label uh column

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.070
the label uh column and uh source for the sorter it's this

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080
and uh source for the sorter it's this

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.389
and uh source for the sorter it's this part of the select. Okay. So this needs

00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399
part of the select. Okay. So this needs

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:45.350
part of the select. Okay. So this needs to be the same. By default we're sorting

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360
to be the same. By default we're sorting

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.029
to be the same. By default we're sorting ascending by a label. For the filters

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039
ascending by a label. For the filters

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:51.830
ascending by a label. For the filters same additional uh we need to pass the

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840
same additional uh we need to pass the

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.149
same additional uh we need to pass the type of filter. So basically label is a

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159
type of filter. So basically label is a

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.389
type of filter. So basically label is a string. So the filter it will be also

00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399
string. So the filter it will be also

00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:02.549
string. So the filter it will be also rendered as a string filter.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:05.269
Uh and then we have actions. As you can

00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279
Uh and then we have actions. As you can

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:07.190
Uh and then we have actions. As you can see we have delete button on the data

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200
see we have delete button on the data

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.950
see we have delete button on the data grid here.

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960
grid here.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.990
grid here. Uh but we don't have this action

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000
Uh but we don't have this action

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.990
Uh but we don't have this action specified

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000
specified

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.990
specified here in this file because this action

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000
here in this file because this action

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.270
here in this file because this action it's a global action and and I will show

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280
it's a global action and and I will show

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.349
it's a global action and and I will show you the details during the next topic.

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359
you the details during the next topic.

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:25.430
you the details during the next topic. Next topic will be about the whole crat.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440
Next topic will be about the whole crat.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.510
Next topic will be about the whole crat. So we're going to talk about remove

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520
So we're going to talk about remove

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.829
So we're going to talk about remove elements. So delete action there. And I

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839
elements. So delete action there. And I

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:33.349
elements. So delete action there. And I will show you how this is generated.

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359
will show you how this is generated.

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.869
will show you how this is generated. For now just remember that this is

00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879
For now just remember that this is

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.869
For now just remember that this is defined as a global action and it will

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879
defined as a global action and it will

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:41.430
defined as a global action and it will appear in some places.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440
appear in some places.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.669
appear in some places. Um so we want to specify the view action

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679
Um so we want to specify the view action

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.790
Um so we want to specify the view action and update action.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800
and update action.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.349
and update action. Um so type for view is navigate. Then it

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359
Um so type for view is navigate. Then it

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.669
Um so type for view is navigate. Then it has some label. It has some icon. As you

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679
has some label. It has some icon. As you

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.150
has some label. It has some icon. As you can see, we have the I icon here. When I

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160
can see, we have the I icon here. When I

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.109
can see, we have the I icon here. When I hover on it, it has some label.

00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119
hover on it, it has some label.

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:05.109
hover on it, it has some label. Um, also you can protect actions with

00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119
Um, also you can protect actions with

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:07.030
Um, also you can protect actions with ACL.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040
ACL.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.270
ACL. So you can show the whole data grid. But

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280
So you can show the whole data grid. But

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.910
So you can show the whole data grid. But for example, disable and hide some

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920
for example, disable and hide some

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.150
for example, disable and hide some actions only. Right? So I can go to view

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160
actions only. Right? So I can go to view

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.470
actions only. Right? So I can go to view but I cannot go to update for example.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480
but I cannot go to update for example.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.349
but I cannot go to update for example. uh then whenever you click anywhere on

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359
uh then whenever you click anywhere on

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:26.150
uh then whenever you click anywhere on this grid I don't need to go here and

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160
this grid I don't need to go here and

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.190
this grid I don't need to go here and click the view action I can assign this

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200
click the view action I can assign this

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.550
click the view action I can assign this action to be a row action so wherever I

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560
action to be a row action so wherever I

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.069
action to be a row action so wherever I click on this row this will do some

00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079
click on this row this will do some

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.390
click on this row this will do some action and if you want to mark a view

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400
action and if you want to mark a view

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.829
action and if you want to mark a view action to be this row action

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839
action to be this row action

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:44.150
action to be this row action this is how we do it so just row action

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160
this is how we do it so just row action

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.589
this is how we do it so just row action true

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:49.990
uh and the most actually important part

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000
uh and the most actually important part

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.270
uh and the most actually important part is the view link. So to be able to tell

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280
is the view link. So to be able to tell

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.109
is the view link. So to be able to tell data grid where to go, we need to

00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119
data grid where to go, we need to

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:59.190
data grid where to go, we need to generate the view link which consists of

00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200
generate the view link which consists of

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.390
generate the view link which consists of the route so the URL but also of the ID

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400
the route so the URL but also of the ID

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.550
the route so the URL but also of the ID parameter. So now we need to go back to

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560
parameter. So now we need to go back to

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.910
parameter. So now we need to go back to our property section. So we need to

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920
our property section. So we need to

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.190
our property section. So we need to first of all pass the ID as a property

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200
first of all pass the ID as a property

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.470
first of all pass the ID as a property for and now this uh ID is available. If

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480
for and now this uh ID is available. If

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.069
for and now this uh ID is available. If you just put tilda, this will

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079
you just put tilda, this will

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:21.510
you just put tilda, this will automatically try to match search for

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520
automatically try to match search for

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.870
automatically try to match search for this in your select. So it will go to

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880
this in your select. So it will go to

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.910
this in your select. So it will go to this part and then our view link

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920
this part and then our view link

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.349
this part and then our view link property it's URL where we pass a route.

00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359
property it's URL where we pass a route.

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:33.829
property it's URL where we pass a route. So this is a route to the view page of a

00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839
So this is a route to the view page of a

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:36.950
So this is a route to the view page of a per payment term. And this route needs

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960
per payment term. And this route needs

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.870
per payment term. And this route needs to uh we need to pass ID to this route,

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880
to uh we need to pass ID to this route,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.030
to uh we need to pass ID to this route, right? because this

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040
right? because this

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.109
right? because this when I click the URL this is the route

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119
when I click the URL this is the route

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:47.670
when I click the URL this is the route for my payment term view but here also

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680
for my payment term view but here also

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.589
for my payment term view but here also we have additional parameter based on

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599
we have additional parameter based on

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:53.910
we have additional parameter based on the payment term that I want to view.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920
the payment term that I want to view.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.270
the payment term that I want to view. So here is how you generate this URL

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280
So here is how you generate this URL

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.190
So here is how you generate this URL based on some route and we're passing

00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200
based on some route and we're passing

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.670
based on some route and we're passing the ID parameter that is defined at the

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680
the ID parameter that is defined at the

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.910
the ID parameter that is defined at the top and now this link can be used here

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920
top and now this link can be used here

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.710
top and now this link can be used here in the view action.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720
in the view action.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.430
in the view action. uh and basically similar thing for the

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440
uh and basically similar thing for the

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.470
uh and basically similar thing for the update. Okay, so we're just basically

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480
update. Okay, so we're just basically

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.109
update. Okay, so we're just basically generating it based on different route

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119
generating it based on different route

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:19.190
generating it based on different route both for view and for update we need to

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200
both for view and for update we need to

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.069
both for view and for update we need to pass the id and here as you can see this

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079
pass the id and here as you can see this

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.390
pass the id and here as you can see this is the representation this looks exactly

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400
is the representation this looks exactly

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.710
is the representation this looks exactly the same like this. So this is an array

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720
the same like this. So this is an array

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.870
the same like this. So this is an array and this is an array. This is YAML file.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880
and this is an array. This is YAML file.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.950
and this is an array. This is YAML file. So we can specify arrays in both ways.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.670
Okay.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680
Okay.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.510
Okay. Uh then here at this uh source part

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520
Uh then here at this uh source part

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.190
Uh then here at this uh source part um you can use just simple selects but

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200
um you can use just simple selects but

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.550
um you can use just simple selects but you can also use complicated selects. So

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560
you can also use complicated selects. So

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.270
you can also use complicated selects. So in case you need this is one of the most

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280
in case you need this is one of the most

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.630
in case you need this is one of the most complicated selects that I found uh in

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640
complicated selects that I found uh in

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.829
complicated selects that I found uh in core we don't put really complicated

00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839
core we don't put really complicated

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:02.630
core we don't put really complicated cases here. uh but yeah you can use case

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640
cases here. uh but yeah you can use case

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.069
cases here. uh but yeah you can use case when for example right so this is not um

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079
when for example right so this is not um

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:10.150
when for example right so this is not um restricted only to the simple part you

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160
restricted only to the simple part you

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.150
restricted only to the simple part you can also do some um more complicated SQL

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160
can also do some um more complicated SQL

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.910
can also do some um more complicated SQL statements here

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.630
and how to do this uh tweak type column

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640
and how to do this uh tweak type column

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.109
and how to do this uh tweak type column examples. So by default if you specify

00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119
examples. So by default if you specify

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.390
examples. So by default if you specify okay let me open this again. By default

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400
okay let me open this again. By default

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.030
okay let me open this again. By default if you specify just that you want to

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040
if you specify just that you want to

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.150
if you specify just that you want to display a label column you just need to

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160
display a label column you just need to

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.349
display a label column you just need to specify the heer title for the heer and

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359
specify the heer title for the heer and

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:39.030
specify the heer title for the heer and that's it. But uh in this case the value

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040
that's it. But uh in this case the value

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.750
that's it. But uh in this case the value will be the row value will be displayed

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760
will be the row value will be displayed

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.069
will be the row value will be displayed here. Okay. So we just have this row

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079
here. Okay. So we just have this row

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:46.069
here. Okay. So we just have this row value. In case you want it to be

00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079
value. In case you want it to be

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:48.069
value. In case you want it to be displayed some in some specific ways.

00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079
displayed some in some specific ways.

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:50.470
displayed some in some specific ways. For example, you want to add div or span

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480
For example, you want to add div or span

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.790
For example, you want to add div or span and then class and style it or make

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800
and then class and style it or make

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.470
and then class and style it or make element bold or anything.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480
element bold or anything.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.990
element bold or anything. Um, you can say that this particular

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000
Um, you can say that this particular

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.870
Um, you can say that this particular cell will be displayed with HTML tweak

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880
cell will be displayed with HTML tweak

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.990
cell will be displayed with HTML tweak template and doing it is really really

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000
template and doing it is really really

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.550
template and doing it is really really simple.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.910
I didn't open that yet.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920
I didn't open that yet.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.310
I didn't open that yet. So as you can see we have multiple

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320
So as you can see we have multiple

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.109
So as you can see we have multiple columns in this particular data grid and

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119
columns in this particular data grid and

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:22.150
columns in this particular data grid and the column user it's actually it's going

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160
the column user it's actually it's going

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.790
the column user it's actually it's going to have some header but then we're

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800
to have some header but then we're

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.230
to have some header but then we're actually going to display it with HTML

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240
actually going to display it with HTML

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.190
actually going to display it with HTML tweak. So we need to specify type tweak

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200
tweak. So we need to specify type tweak

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.910
tweak. So we need to specify type tweak front end type HTML and then you can

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920
front end type HTML and then you can

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.950
front end type HTML and then you can pass the template.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960
pass the template.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.270
pass the template. Okay. So this is the path to templates

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280
Okay. So this is the path to templates

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.109
Okay. So this is the path to templates this add notation that comes from uh

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119
this add notation that comes from uh

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:48.870
this add notation that comes from uh symfony

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.550
uh

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560
uh

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.510
uh and then inside

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520
and then inside

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.670
and then inside this template you have always two

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680
this template you have always two

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.829
this template you have always two variables. First of all, you have a

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839
variables. First of all, you have a

00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:01.670
variables. First of all, you have a value of this particular cell. But also

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680
value of this particular cell. But also

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.470
value of this particular cell. But also to those templates,

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480
to those templates,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.710
to those templates, uh we also always pass the whole row.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720
uh we also always pass the whole row.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.950
uh we also always pass the whole row. So,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960
So,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:21.829
So, where is my IDE?

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:33.349
Actually, not good example.

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:49.430
Let me just search for something.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:41:00.150
Okay. But this is

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.950
I want to find example with both

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960
I want to find example with both

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:14.150
I want to find example with both elements.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.950
Oh my god. Only so complicated ones.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960
Oh my god. Only so complicated ones.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.330
Oh my god. Only so complicated ones. Seriously,

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.790
[Music]

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800
[Music]

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.030
[Music] I'll get there. I promise. Just give me

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040
I'll get there. I promise. Just give me

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.790
I'll get there. I promise. Just give me a second.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800
a second.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.870
a second. Well, I will just show you

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.550
two examples or I will show you solution

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560
two examples or I will show you solution

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.910
two examples or I will show you solution from our practice.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.790
Okay.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.550
I will show you solutions from our

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560
I will show you solutions from our

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.670
I will show you solutions from our practice.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.230
Oh no, I have it. Okay. Uh so for those

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240
Oh no, I have it. Okay. Uh so for those

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.109
Oh no, I have it. Okay. Uh so for those uh HTML tweak templates, our data grid

00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119
uh HTML tweak templates, our data grid

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.190
uh HTML tweak templates, our data grid engine will always pass you two

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200
engine will always pass you two

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.829
engine will always pass you two elements. First will be access to

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839
elements. First will be access to

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:08.230
elements. First will be access to basically the cell value that will be

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240
basically the cell value that will be

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.230
basically the cell value that will be displayed here, but you will also have

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240
displayed here, but you will also have

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.190
displayed here, but you will also have access to the whole row. Okay. So in

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200
access to the whole row. Okay. So in

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.190
access to the whole row. Okay. So in this case and that's maybe not the best

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200
this case and that's maybe not the best

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.069
this case and that's maybe not the best situation but in this case if I'd like

00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079
situation but in this case if I'd like

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:22.470
situation but in this case if I'd like to display this particular cell with

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480
to display this particular cell with

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.670
to display this particular cell with HTML tweak template uh inside HTML tweak

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680
HTML tweak template uh inside HTML tweak

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.390
HTML tweak template uh inside HTML tweak template I'd have two variables one will

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400
template I'd have two variables one will

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.390
template I'd have two variables one will be the cell value so basically this

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400
be the cell value so basically this

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.270
be the cell value so basically this email and second will be record so this

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280
email and second will be record so this

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.829
email and second will be record so this whole row okay uh so if you want to

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839
whole row okay uh so if you want to

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:40.870
whole row okay uh so if you want to display uh the cell value you have it

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880
display uh the cell value you have it

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.390
display uh the cell value you have it under the value uh parameter variable

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400
under the value uh parameter variable

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.109
under the value uh parameter variable and then you have also record variable

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119
and then you have also record variable

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:50.390
and then you have also record variable which is the whole row. So you can say

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400
which is the whole row. So you can say

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.150
which is the whole row. So you can say get value and specify the any column

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160
get value and specify the any column

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.630
get value and specify the any column name that is in this row and this will

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640
name that is in this row and this will

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.510
name that is in this row and this will return you this other column name here

00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520
return you this other column name here

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.150
return you this other column name here too. Okay, so you have always two

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160
too. Okay, so you have always two

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:09.589
too. Okay, so you have always two elements cell value and the whole row.

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:12.390
Okay, I should probably add this example

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400
Okay, I should probably add this example

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.990
Okay, I should probably add this example to the slide.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.190
Uh, and how to customize data grid. Um,

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200
Uh, and how to customize data grid. Um,

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.470
Uh, and how to customize data grid. Um, so data grid yam file, it's going to be

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480
so data grid yam file, it's going to be

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.390
so data grid yam file, it's going to be merged based on the bundle loading

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400
merged based on the bundle loading

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.829
merged based on the bundle loading order. Okay. So if you just want to

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839
order. Okay. So if you just want to

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:34.470
order. Okay. So if you just want to override some existing grid, you need to

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480
override some existing grid, you need to

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.470
override some existing grid, you need to create data grid yam file in your

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480
create data grid yam file in your

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.990
create data grid yam file in your bundle.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000
bundle.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.349
bundle. uh find out the original grid name, put

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359
uh find out the original grid name, put

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:43.829
uh find out the original grid name, put it there and apply modifications. At the

00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839
it there and apply modifications. At the

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:46.309
it there and apply modifications. At the end, you will have everything from our

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319
end, you will have everything from our

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:47.910
end, you will have everything from our original

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920
original

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.069
original uh bundle and on top of it your changes

00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079
uh bundle and on top of it your changes

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:54.470
uh bundle and on top of it your changes assuming that your bundle it's loaded

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480
assuming that your bundle it's loaded

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.190
assuming that your bundle it's loaded after the core bundles. I assume that's

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200
after the core bundles. I assume that's

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.270
after the core bundles. I assume that's always true.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280
always true.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.150
always true. Uh then also you don't need to copy

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160
Uh then also you don't need to copy

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.069
Uh then also you don't need to copy paste the whole configuration of the

00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079
paste the whole configuration of the

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:06.230
paste the whole configuration of the data grid if you'll have uh two data

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240
data grid if you'll have uh two data

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.630
data grid if you'll have uh two data grids that are very similar one to the

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640
grids that are very similar one to the

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.790
grids that are very similar one to the other because you can create a data grid

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800
other because you can create a data grid

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.790
other because you can create a data grid and say that it extends some other grid.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800
and say that it extends some other grid.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.910
and say that it extends some other grid. Uh then also uh when the grid is built

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920
Uh then also uh when the grid is built

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.390
Uh then also uh when the grid is built uh we dispatch grid events. So we can

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400
uh we dispatch grid events. So we can

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.870
uh we dispatch grid events. So we can also create listener and listen to build

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880
also create listener and listen to build

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.950
also create listener and listen to build before build after or result before

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960
before build after or result before

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.910
before build after or result before result after. Um so first it's uh those

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920
result after. Um so first it's uh those

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.630
result after. Um so first it's uh those are events the builder events are when

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640
are events the builder events are when

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.190
are events the builder events are when the data grid is built based on the

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200
the data grid is built based on the

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.990
the data grid is built based on the configuration in our yam file and then

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000
configuration in our yam file and then

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.910
configuration in our yam file and then data source. So basically when the

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920
data source. So basically when the

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.550
data source. So basically when the results are taken for example from the

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560
results are taken for example from the

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.270
results are taken for example from the database. Okay. So you can also do some

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280
database. Okay. So you can also do some

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.349
database. Okay. So you can also do some modifications with the listeners in case

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359
modifications with the listeners in case

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:52.230
modifications with the listeners in case you need any complicated logic there

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240
you need any complicated logic there

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.630
you need any complicated logic there that it's impossible to put inside y

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640
that it's impossible to put inside y

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.390
that it's impossible to put inside y file.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400
file.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.349
file. Uh and uh just as an information that

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359
Uh and uh just as an information that

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:01.910
Uh and uh just as an information that some parts of a data grid uh not

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920
some parts of a data grid uh not

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.550
some parts of a data grid uh not everything sits in or data grid bundle.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560
everything sits in or data grid bundle.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.109
everything sits in or data grid bundle. Some parts are just divided to separate

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119
Some parts are just divided to separate

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:09.750
Some parts are just divided to separate bundles. For example, pagenation and

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760
bundles. For example, pagenation and

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.510
bundles. For example, pagenation and those are called grid extensions.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520
those are called grid extensions.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.190
those are called grid extensions. You can check a list of all the

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200
You can check a list of all the

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.750
You can check a list of all the extensions. Basically uh the idea is

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760
extensions. Basically uh the idea is

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.430
extensions. Basically uh the idea is that not everything sits in the data

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440
that not everything sits in the data

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.109
that not everything sits in the data grid bundle because it would be very

00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119
grid bundle because it would be very

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:22.710
grid bundle because it would be very very big and we have some

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720
very big and we have some

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.069
very big and we have some functionalities that can be like

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079
functionalities that can be like

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:26.150
functionalities that can be like standalone functionalities.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160
standalone functionalities.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.950
standalone functionalities. Uh so for example pager it's it's it's

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960
Uh so for example pager it's it's it's

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.109
Uh so for example pager it's it's it's in separate uh bundle

00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119
in separate uh bundle

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:37.349
in separate uh bundle uh okay and example of

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359
uh okay and example of

00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:40.710
uh okay and example of data grid listener uh for example this

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720
data grid listener uh for example this

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.190
data grid listener uh for example this listener listens to

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.190
listens to build before so before the

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200
listens to build before so before the

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.829
listens to build before so before the configuration is being been built that's

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839
configuration is being been built that's

00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:54.230
configuration is being been built that's why you have a config here and this

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240
why you have a config here and this

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.390
why you have a config here and this config as you can See we can fetch ORM

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400
config as you can See we can fetch ORM

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.069
config as you can See we can fetch ORM query add some select add sortters

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079
query add some select add sortters

00:46:00.079 --> 00:46:02.550
query add some select add sortters filters. This is exactly the same that

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560
filters. This is exactly the same that

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.309
filters. This is exactly the same that we have in um data grid y file here.

00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319
we have in um data grid y file here.

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:08.230
we have in um data grid y file here. Okay. So at the end you just get this

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240
Okay. So at the end you just get this

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.870
Okay. So at the end you just get this configuration in your PHP class and you

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880
configuration in your PHP class and you

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.870
configuration in your PHP class and you can change this configuration not in

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880
can change this configuration not in

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.950
can change this configuration not in YAML but in PHP class in case you prefer

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960
YAML but in PHP class in case you prefer

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.030
YAML but in PHP class in case you prefer this way or sometimes you want to for

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040
this way or sometimes you want to for

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.390
this way or sometimes you want to for example add a column or do something

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400
example add a column or do something

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.910
example add a column or do something based on some business cases. So you

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920
based on some business cases. So you

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.829
based on some business cases. So you cannot put ifs in the grit file but you

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839
cannot put ifs in the grit file but you

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:34.550
cannot put ifs in the grit file but you can totally do it in a PHP code. So in

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560
can totally do it in a PHP code. So in

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.950
can totally do it in a PHP code. So in this situation you also can use listener

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960
this situation you also can use listener

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.109
this situation you also can use listener and our pagionation extension. Basically

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119
and our pagionation extension. Basically

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:46.470
and our pagionation extension. Basically the file just specify how to

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480
the file just specify how to

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.030
the file just specify how to turn this on or off. Okay. So inside

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040
turn this on or off. Okay. So inside

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.069
turn this on or off. Okay. So inside options we have entity pagenation

00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079
options we have entity pagenation

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:54.230
options we have entity pagenation and this is probably everywhere. Inside

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240
and this is probably everywhere. Inside

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.710
and this is probably everywhere. Inside options we have entity pagenation.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720
options we have entity pagenation.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.870
options we have entity pagenation. Right. So we just specify how to turn

00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880
Right. So we just specify how to turn

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.150
Right. So we just specify how to turn some functionalities on or off uh for

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160
some functionalities on or off uh for

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.670
some functionalities on or off uh for our data grid.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.230
And one short exercise, I will actually

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240
And one short exercise, I will actually

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.150
And one short exercise, I will actually do it on my site. You can watch and

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160
do it on my site. You can watch and

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.390
do it on my site. You can watch and see that it's really easy to edit some

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400
see that it's really easy to edit some

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.870
see that it's really easy to edit some existing data grid and how to actually

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880
existing data grid and how to actually

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.670
existing data grid and how to actually find the data grid name. Uh so we would

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680
find the data grid name. Uh so we would

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.030
find the data grid name. Uh so we would like to disable first name filter from

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040
like to disable first name filter from

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.710
like to disable first name filter from contacts grid. Okay. So because my

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720
contacts grid. Okay. So because my

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.190
contacts grid. Okay. So because my bundle is loaded after the core bundles,

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200
bundle is loaded after the core bundles,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.829
bundle is loaded after the core bundles, all I need to do is create a databm file

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839
all I need to do is create a databm file

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:37.270
all I need to do is create a databm file in my bundle and override this little

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280
in my bundle and override this little

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.430
in my bundle and override this little element. So disable filter uh third time

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440
element. So disable filter uh third time

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.910
element. So disable filter uh third time filter. Okay, I don't need to copy paste

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920
filter. Okay, I don't need to copy paste

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.150
filter. Okay, I don't need to copy paste the whole grid because that grids file

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160
the whole grid because that grids file

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.630
the whole grid because that grids file are merged.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640
are merged.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.309
are merged. Uh okay. So let's

00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319
Uh okay. So let's

00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:55.349
Uh okay. So let's go to my contacts and not this

00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359
go to my contacts and not this

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:58.870
go to my contacts and not this environment. This environment

00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880
environment. This environment

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.950
environment. This environment customer contacts

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.230
refresh it

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240
refresh it

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.270
refresh it better. Okay. So here is my first name

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280
better. Okay. So here is my first name

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.470
better. Okay. So here is my first name filter and I would like just to remove

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480
filter and I would like just to remove

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.870
filter and I would like just to remove it from here

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880
it from here

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.790
it from here from the datagram file. You cannot

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800
from the datagram file. You cannot

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.790
from the datagram file. You cannot totally remove it. it will just not be

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800
totally remove it. it will just not be

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.470
totally remove it. it will just not be displayed here but it will be always

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480
displayed here but it will be always

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.829
displayed here but it will be always available here. If I switch I can show

00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839
available here. If I switch I can show

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:27.349
available here. If I switch I can show it again. Okay, this is what we will do.

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359
it again. Okay, this is what we will do.

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:28.870
it again. Okay, this is what we will do. Um

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880
Um

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.829
Um yeah so first how to find out the name

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839
yeah so first how to find out the name

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:34.710
yeah so first how to find out the name of this data grid.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720
of this data grid.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.109
of this data grid. I always do it from here. So whenever I

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119
I always do it from here. So whenever I

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:41.510
I always do it from here. So whenever I clicked anywhere on this data grid, I

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520
clicked anywhere on this data grid, I

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:49.750
clicked anywhere on this data grid, I just scroll a little bit up.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.829
Oh my gosh, I will disable this tweak

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839
Oh my gosh, I will disable this tweak

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.829
Oh my gosh, I will disable this tweak inspector. Sorry guys, but I just see

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839
inspector. Sorry guys, but I just see

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:58.309
inspector. Sorry guys, but I just see too many elements here and a lot of

00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319
too many elements here and a lot of

00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:01.910
too many elements here and a lot of those greens are not really helpful.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920
those greens are not really helpful.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.510
those greens are not really helpful. Okay, so we have heather

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520
Okay, so we have heather

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.430
Okay, so we have heather Um

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.190
and at some point we have grid

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200
and at some point we have grid

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.510
and at some point we have grid id grid context grid blah blah blah and

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520
id grid context grid blah blah blah and

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.069
id grid context grid blah blah blah and we have data page component name context

00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079
we have data page component name context

00:49:18.079 --> 00:49:20.470
we have data page component name context grid and this is data grid component.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480
grid and this is data grid component.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.630
grid and this is data grid component. Okay. So this component always has the

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640
Okay. So this component always has the

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.589
Okay. So this component always has the data grid name and this is the one. So

00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599
data grid name and this is the one. So

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:29.829
data grid name and this is the one. So this is my contacts grid

00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839
this is my contacts grid

00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:31.589
this is my contacts grid and this is the one that I'd like to

00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599
and this is the one that I'd like to

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:35.270
and this is the one that I'd like to overwrite and I'd like to disable uh

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280
overwrite and I'd like to disable uh

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.630
overwrite and I'd like to disable uh first name filter. So let's see the

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640
first name filter. So let's see the

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.630
first name filter. So let's see the original definition first.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.030
Okay.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040
Okay.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.510
Okay. Uh here all the definitions are finished

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520
Uh here all the definitions are finished

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.430
Uh here all the definitions are finished with a colon. So you can basically

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440
with a colon. So you can basically

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.870
with a colon. So you can basically search for the name of the grid and

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880
search for the name of the grid and

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.150
search for the name of the grid and colon and then we're here. So this is

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160
colon and then we're here. So this is

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.790
colon and then we're here. So this is the definition of my context grid and I

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800
the definition of my context grid and I

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.870
the definition of my context grid and I will just override the part of it. I

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880
will just override the part of it. I

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.990
will just override the part of it. I will override the filter section.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.670
Filter

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680
Filter

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.069
Filter first name, right? First name or last

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079
first name, right? First name or last

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:15.349
first name, right? First name or last name? What was it? First name. Cool.

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359
name? What was it? First name. Cool.

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:18.549
name? What was it? First name. Cool. Okay. So the column filter column name

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559
Okay. So the column filter column name

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:20.870
Okay. So the column filter column name is first name. and I just want to

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880
is first name. and I just want to

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.829
is first name. and I just want to disable it. So right now what I would do

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839
disable it. So right now what I would do

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:27.030
disable it. So right now what I would do I will go to my bundle in resources

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040
I will go to my bundle in resources

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.430
I will go to my bundle in resources config oro I need to create the data

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440
config oro I need to create the data

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.589
config oro I need to create the data grid yam file. I already have it but

00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599
grid yam file. I already have it but

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:35.990
grid yam file. I already have it but normally you will just create this file.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000
normally you will just create this file.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.270
normally you will just create this file. Then under the data grid name space I

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280
Then under the data grid name space I

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.430
Then under the data grid name space I need to specify what data grid I want to

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440
need to specify what data grid I want to

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.069
need to specify what data grid I want to modify or create. So I want to modify

00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079
modify or create. So I want to modify

00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:48.790
modify or create. So I want to modify this and I want to modify section filter

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800
this and I want to modify section filter

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.109
this and I want to modify section filter section. Those autocomplete hints are

00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119
section. Those autocomplete hints are

00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:54.870
section. Those autocomplete hints are coming from oral plug-in to PHP storm.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880
coming from oral plug-in to PHP storm.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.710
coming from oral plug-in to PHP storm. Uh then

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720
Uh then

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.870
Uh then columns then my

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880
columns then my

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.630
columns then my column name. So I have no hints here

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640
column name. So I have no hints here

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.510
column name. So I have no hints here because the column name is custom. And

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520
because the column name is custom. And

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:12.069
because the column name is custom. And this is the first name.

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:17.349
And uh here one and only super error

00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359
And uh here one and only super error

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:20.069
And uh here one and only super error that we have in our plug-in. If you do

00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079
that we have in our plug-in. If you do

00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:22.630
that we have in our plug-in. If you do enabled false, this will not work. You

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640
enabled false, this will not work. You

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.510
enabled false, this will not work. You need to do disable true. And this is uh

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520
need to do disable true. And this is uh

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.270
need to do disable true. And this is uh stated in documentation that it's

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280
stated in documentation that it's

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.630
stated in documentation that it's disabled true. Our plug-in is just being

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640
disabled true. Our plug-in is just being

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.670
disabled true. Our plug-in is just being updated. So I hope soon we will fix

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680
updated. So I hope soon we will fix

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.030
updated. So I hope soon we will fix those small um elements. But to be

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040
those small um elements. But to be

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.950
those small um elements. But to be honest for the data grown file that's

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960
honest for the data grown file that's

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:47.190
honest for the data grown file that's the only error that I found. So

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.470
true

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.829
and I don't need to clear cache

00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:58.309
and this filter is not here. Okay. So we

00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319
and this filter is not here. Okay. So we

00:51:58.319 --> 00:52:00.309
and this filter is not here. Okay. So we have last name previously we had here

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319
have last name previously we had here

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:02.870
have last name previously we had here the first name. Okay. So really changing

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880
the first name. Okay. So really changing

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.510
the first name. Okay. So really changing modifying something simple in already

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520
modifying something simple in already

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.349
modifying something simple in already existing grid it's as simple as adding

00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359
existing grid it's as simple as adding

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:14.630
existing grid it's as simple as adding this few configuration values here.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640
this few configuration values here.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:21.190
this few configuration values here. So this can be really really quick.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.950
Uh okay do you have any questions to

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960
Uh okay do you have any questions to

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:29.430
Uh okay do you have any questions to this data grid part?

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.589
So let's do the break. Uh let's say 15

00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599
So let's do the break. Uh let's say 15

00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:39.109
So let's do the break. Uh let's say 15 18 minutes 20 past my three whatever it

00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119
18 minutes 20 past my three whatever it

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:51.600
18 minutes 20 past my three whatever it will be on your side.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:58.309
[Music]

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:01.030
Okay guys, welcome after the break and

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040
Okay guys, welcome after the break and

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:09.349
Okay guys, welcome after the break and please let me know if you are here.

00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:21.270
Okay.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.510
Okay.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.549
So almost all of you said yes. So let's

00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559
So almost all of you said yes. So let's

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:31.910
So almost all of you said yes. So let's start. Uh two last elements to this

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920
start. Uh two last elements to this

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.870
start. Uh two last elements to this topic. Uh first will be basically the

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880
topic. Uh first will be basically the

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.790
topic. Uh first will be basically the index page which is the template is

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800
index page which is the template is

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.109
index page which is the template is really really simple if you use our base

00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119
really really simple if you use our base

00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:42.630
really really simple if you use our base templates.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640
templates.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.349
templates. Uh so first to display the index page we

00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359
Uh so first to display the index page we

00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:48.309
Uh so first to display the index page we already talked about data grid. So we

00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319
already talked about data grid. So we

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:51.190
already talked about data grid. So we have something to display there. Sorry

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200
have something to display there. Sorry

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.990
have something to display there. Sorry guys. Okay. Uh we have something to

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000
guys. Okay. Uh we have something to

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.589
guys. Okay. Uh we have something to display there. Uh and we need to create

00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599
display there. Uh and we need to create

00:53:57.599 --> 00:54:00.870
display there. Uh and we need to create now a controller with action and specify

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880
now a controller with action and specify

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.190
now a controller with action and specify this route. Route will be without

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200
this route. Route will be without

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.349
this route. Route will be without parameters because index page it's

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359
parameters because index page it's

00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:08.790
parameters because index page it's basically for us. Uh this is usually a

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800
basically for us. Uh this is usually a

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.549
basically for us. Uh this is usually a slash. So we're going to have some

00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559
slash. So we're going to have some

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:14.069
slash. So we're going to have some prefix defining in the routing y file.

00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079
prefix defining in the routing y file.

00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:16.870
prefix defining in the routing y file. But then this is basically just a route

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880
But then this is basically just a route

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.430
But then this is basically just a route without any parameters.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440
without any parameters.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.630
without any parameters. Uh we usually have this data grid there

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640
Uh we usually have this data grid there

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.510
Uh we usually have this data grid there and uh also some additional actions for

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520
and uh also some additional actions for

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.230
and uh also some additional actions for example import export buttons

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240
example import export buttons

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.870
example import export buttons uh create button or something like that.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880
uh create button or something like that.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.589
uh create button or something like that. And here we will also need to create the

00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599
And here we will also need to create the

00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:38.309
And here we will also need to create the index template. So first will be our

00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319
index template. So first will be our

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:41.990
index template. So first will be our controller.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.150
Okay. Uh and uh here to create

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160
Okay. Uh and uh here to create

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.109
Okay. Uh and uh here to create controller we basically always put it

00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119
controller we basically always put it

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.829
controller we basically always put it inside the controller directory just to

00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839
inside the controller directory just to

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:54.069
inside the controller directory just to have some order in the bundle not have

00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079
have some order in the bundle not have

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.630
have some order in the bundle not have it everything inside. So we you'll see

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640
it everything inside. So we you'll see

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.510
it everything inside. So we you'll see that in or all our core bundles we have

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520
that in or all our core bundles we have

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.670
that in or all our core bundles we have this controller directory and put we put

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680
this controller directory and put we put

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.990
this controller directory and put we put all the controllers there. Uh then uh

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000
all the controllers there. Uh then uh

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.390
all the controllers there. Uh then uh this going to be a controller for the

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400
this going to be a controller for the

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.150
this going to be a controller for the payment term entity.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.750
Uh so payment ter controller it needs to

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760
Uh so payment ter controller it needs to

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.510
Uh so payment ter controller it needs to extend the actually it doesn't need to

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520
extend the actually it doesn't need to

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.790
extend the actually it doesn't need to but if you'd like to use uh some methods

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800
but if you'd like to use uh some methods

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.950
but if you'd like to use uh some methods from abstract controller from symphon

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960
from abstract controller from symphon

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.349
from abstract controller from symphon framework bundle then you will need to

00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359
framework bundle then you will need to

00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:29.829
framework bundle then you will need to for example to display uh to create a

00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839
for example to display uh to create a

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:32.309
for example to display uh to create a form there are many nice actions in this

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319
form there are many nice actions in this

00:55:32.319 --> 00:55:35.190
form there are many nice actions in this controller. So for the simple controller

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200
controller. So for the simple controller

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.750
controller. So for the simple controller that just has this index action, we

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760
that just has this index action, we

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.309
that just has this index action, we don't need to even extend it. But later

00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319
don't need to even extend it. But later

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:42.470
don't need to even extend it. But later on at some point you will figure out

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480
on at some point you will figure out

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.750
on at some point you will figure out that you actually want this.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760
that you actually want this.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.710
that you actually want this. Uh then

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720
Uh then

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.829
Uh then the syntax action is very simple because

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839
the syntax action is very simple because

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:54.390
the syntax action is very simple because all that we need to pass to our template

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400
all that we need to pass to our template

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.190
all that we need to pass to our template is the entity class uh parameter and

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200
is the entity class uh parameter and

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.950
is the entity class uh parameter and this is basically the class of our

00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960
this is basically the class of our

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.430
this is basically the class of our entity that we will uh want to display.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440
entity that we will uh want to display.

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.270
entity that we will uh want to display. uh we define uh routes as annotations.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280
uh we define uh routes as annotations.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.589
uh we define uh routes as annotations. So we have this at route annotation that

00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599
So we have this at route annotation that

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:13.270
So we have this at route annotation that it's included here

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280
it's included here

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.030
it's included here and in here you just specify the the URL

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040
and in here you just specify the the URL

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.829
and in here you just specify the the URL so only slash and every route needs to

00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839
so only slash and every route needs to

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:22.390
so only slash and every route needs to have a name uh name needs to be unique

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400
have a name uh name needs to be unique

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.950
have a name uh name needs to be unique and we have this convention that it's

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960
and we have this convention that it's

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.349
and we have this convention that it's like we are in oro payment term bundle

00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359
like we are in oro payment term bundle

00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:30.309
like we are in oro payment term bundle and we're displaying payment term index

00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319
and we're displaying payment term index

00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:32.789
and we're displaying payment term index so it's going to be oruro payment term

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799
so it's going to be oruro payment term

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:35.510
so it's going to be oruro payment term index then for the view route we will

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520
index then for the view route we will

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.910
index then for the view route we will have oro payment term view. So basically

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920
have oro payment term view. So basically

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.230
have oro payment term view. So basically the route name also tell tells us

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240
the route name also tell tells us

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.030
the route name also tell tells us something and this is up to you but we

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040
something and this is up to you but we

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.349
something and this is up to you but we do have this naming convention. So you

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359
do have this naming convention. So you

00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:47.990
do have this naming convention. So you can also follow this

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000
can also follow this

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.349
can also follow this uh about ICL. We'll talk in next topics.

00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359
uh about ICL. We'll talk in next topics.

00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:52.950
uh about ICL. We'll talk in next topics. Uh

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960
Uh

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.829
Uh okay. So this is controller.

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839
okay. So this is controller.

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:59.349
okay. So this is controller. This is how we specify the route. Uh we

00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359
This is how we specify the route. Uh we

00:56:59.359 --> 00:57:03.430
This is how we specify the route. Uh we still need the routing y file.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440
still need the routing y file.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.829
still need the routing y file. Uh so let me show you. This is

00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839
Uh so let me show you. This is

00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:11.430
Uh so let me show you. This is exactly same as for symfony. We just put

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440
exactly same as for symfony. We just put

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.309
exactly same as for symfony. We just put it in different place inside resources

00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319
it in different place inside resources

00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:18.069
it in different place inside resources config orura. Here is the routing y file

00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079
config orura. Here is the routing y file

00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:20.950
config orura. Here is the routing y file and you'll see plenty of examples in a

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960
and you'll see plenty of examples in a

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.630
and you'll see plenty of examples in a lot of our bundles. And uh basically the

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640
lot of our bundles. And uh basically the

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.030
lot of our bundles. And uh basically the definition here is always like this. So

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040
definition here is always like this. So

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.270
definition here is always like this. So we have some item it needs to have some

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280
we have some item it needs to have some

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.150
we have some item it needs to have some identifier. Then under resource we put a

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160
identifier. Then under resource we put a

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:36.309
identifier. Then under resource we put a path with exactly this uh format to our

00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319
path with exactly this uh format to our

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:39.430
path with exactly this uh format to our controller class. And then we define

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440
controller class. And then we define

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.589
controller class. And then we define routes with the annotation

00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599
routes with the annotation

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:51.670
routes with the annotation with

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.910
with those annotations.

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920
with those annotations.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.150
with those annotations. So in our routing we specify type

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160
So in our routing we specify type

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.109
So in our routing we specify type annotation and if you want uh this whole

00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119
annotation and if you want uh this whole

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:01.430
annotation and if you want uh this whole controller actions to be to have some

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440
controller actions to be to have some

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.870
controller actions to be to have some prefix uh you can also specify it here.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880
prefix uh you can also specify it here.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.270
prefix uh you can also specify it here. So it will be payment term. This will be

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280
So it will be payment term. This will be

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.270
So it will be payment term. This will be for the index. Then for the view will be

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280
for the index. Then for the view will be

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.750
for the index. Then for the view will be payment term and

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760
payment term and

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.750
payment term and view and ID. Right? For the create

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760
view and ID. Right? For the create

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.309
view and ID. Right? For the create action this will be payment slash term

00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319
action this will be payment slash term

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:22.710
action this will be payment slash term slashcreate and so on. So if you want to

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720
slashcreate and so on. So if you want to

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.950
slashcreate and so on. So if you want to have some prefix before those

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960
have some prefix before those

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.630
have some prefix before those definitions here uh you can define it in

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640
definitions here uh you can define it in

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.109
definitions here uh you can define it in here. Okay. So basically annotation

00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119
here. Okay. So basically annotation

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:34.870
here. Okay. So basically annotation prefix if you want it and uh path to our

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880
prefix if you want it and uh path to our

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.630
prefix if you want it and uh path to our controller file. That's it.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640
controller file. That's it.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.230
controller file. That's it. And now in our controller

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240
And now in our controller

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.950
And now in our controller uh we need to specify also the template.

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960
uh we need to specify also the template.

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.390
uh we need to specify also the template. We also need do it with annotations.

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400
We also need do it with annotations.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.670
We also need do it with annotations. uh and you can specify the path to HTML

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680
uh and you can specify the path to HTML

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.670
uh and you can specify the path to HTML tweak template but if you don't

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680
tweak template but if you don't

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.270
tweak template but if you don't Symphfony will do it by some pattern and

00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280
Symphfony will do it by some pattern and

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.829
Symphfony will do it by some pattern and actually where it will look inside our

00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839
actually where it will look inside our

00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:04.710
actually where it will look inside our bundle inside resources

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.470
views

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480
views

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.030
views okay and relative to this it will try to

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040
okay and relative to this it will try to

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.910
okay and relative to this it will try to find the directory that uh is built from

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920
find the directory that uh is built from

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.230
find the directory that uh is built from the controller name without the

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240
the controller name without the

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.870
the controller name without the controller postfix so it will be payment

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880
controller postfix so it will be payment

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.109
controller postfix so it will be payment term directory library and then it will

00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119
term directory library and then it will

00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:21.030
term directory library and then it will search for

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040
search for

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.549
search for index html tweak file. So the file will

00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559
index html tweak file. So the file will

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:26.549
index html tweak file. So the file will be like the action name without action

00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559
be like the action name without action

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:29.510
be like the action name without action postfix. So it will search it will load

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520
postfix. So it will search it will load

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.230
postfix. So it will search it will load by default if you just specify this uh

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240
by default if you just specify this uh

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.589
by default if you just specify this uh resources views payment term

00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599
resources views payment term

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:40.150
resources views payment term index html tweak this one this file.

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160
index html tweak this one this file.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.829
index html tweak this one this file. Okay.

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839
Okay.

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:44.150
Okay. uh you can specify it uh but if you just

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160
uh you can specify it uh but if you just

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.270
uh you can specify it uh but if you just leave it empty it will automatically

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280
leave it empty it will automatically

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.349
leave it empty it will automatically load this one.

00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359
load this one.

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:51.910
load this one. Uh and this is the last element uh that

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920
Uh and this is the last element uh that

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.309
Uh and this is the last element uh that we need to create this index template

00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319
we need to create this index template

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:56.309
we need to create this index template and

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319
and

00:59:56.319 --> 00:59:59.510
and this index template can be really really

00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520
this index template can be really really

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.430
this index template can be really really short. Our one will be even shorter. Uh

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440
short. Our one will be even shorter. Uh

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.190
short. Our one will be even shorter. Uh so first of all uh I strongly advise to

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200
so first of all uh I strongly advise to

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.309
so first of all uh I strongly advise to extend our default index html tweak

01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319
extend our default index html tweak

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:12.309
extend our default index html tweak because it has everything inside uh

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319
because it has everything inside uh

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.630
because it has everything inside uh inside. So it will render some custom

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640
inside. So it will render some custom

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.910
inside. So it will render some custom actions if you define them. Um it will

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920
actions if you define them. Um it will

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.990
actions if you define them. Um it will render data grid. You only need to pass

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000
render data grid. You only need to pass

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.349
render data grid. You only need to pass the grid name. So this base uh parent

01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359
the grid name. So this base uh parent

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:26.230
the grid name. So this base uh parent class will take care of like everything.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240
class will take care of like everything.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.030
class will take care of like everything. So our index html normally will just

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040
So our index html normally will just

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.990
So our index html normally will just extend from parent and we need to set

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000
extend from parent and we need to set

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.950
extend from parent and we need to set pass the grid name under this parameter

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960
pass the grid name under this parameter

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.950
pass the grid name under this parameter and that's basically all that you really

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960
and that's basically all that you really

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.549
and that's basically all that you really need.

01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559
need.

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:40.390
need. Then you can add some par additional

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400
Then you can add some par additional

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.030
Then you can add some par additional elements like page title or inside

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040
elements like page title or inside

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.069
elements like page title or inside navigation uh blog buttons you can add

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079
navigation uh blog buttons you can add

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:49.190
navigation uh blog buttons you can add create button. Okay. In some uh usually

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200
create button. Okay. In some uh usually

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.430
create button. Okay. In some uh usually we do have create button. Sometimes we

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440
we do have create button. Sometimes we

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.150
we do have create button. Sometimes we don't. For our custom entity, we will

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160
don't. For our custom entity, we will

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.950
don't. For our custom entity, we will actually not create create button. So

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960
actually not create create button. So

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.230
actually not create create button. So we'll just have extend and set grid

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240
we'll just have extend and set grid

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.030
we'll just have extend and set grid name. And that will be really enough. Uh

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040
name. And that will be really enough. Uh

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.990
name. And that will be really enough. Uh and parent template will take care of

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000
and parent template will take care of

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.270
and parent template will take care of displaying this data grid

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280
displaying this data grid

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.829
displaying this data grid and any buttons if we specify. So index

01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839
and any buttons if we specify. So index

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:14.470
and any buttons if we specify. So index pages are really usually very very very

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480
pages are really usually very very very

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.789
pages are really usually very very very short.

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:21.670
Okay,

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680
Okay,

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.990
Okay, so we have data grid, we have index page

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000
so we have data grid, we have index page

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.549
so we have data grid, we have index page controller, everything. But right now to

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559
controller, everything. But right now to

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:28.870
controller, everything. But right now to enter our index page, we need to type

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880
enter our index page, we need to type

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.950
enter our index page, we need to type the URL in the browser, which is really

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960
the URL in the browser, which is really

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.030
the URL in the browser, which is really not funny

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040
not funny

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.109
not funny because we don't remember the URLs and

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119
because we don't remember the URLs and

01:01:35.119 --> 01:01:38.309
because we don't remember the URLs and it's the UI is bad. We need a menu

01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319
it's the UI is bad. We need a menu

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.030
it's the UI is bad. We need a menu element. So we want to put the link to

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040
element. So we want to put the link to

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.589
element. So we want to put the link to our index page somewhere. For example,

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599
our index page somewhere. For example,

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.670
our index page somewhere. For example, here, right? Like we have the link to

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680
here, right? Like we have the link to

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.150
here, right? Like we have the link to users view page or here we have to

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160
users view page or here we have to

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.030
users view page or here we have to contacts uh sorry contact list page

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040
contacts uh sorry contact list page

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.950
contacts uh sorry contact list page index page uh and for this we'll use uh

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960
index page uh and for this we'll use uh

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.549
index page uh and for this we'll use uh our menu uh we use canopy menu bundle

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559
our menu uh we use canopy menu bundle

01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:00.470
our menu uh we use canopy menu bundle and on top of it we have our aura

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480
and on top of it we have our aura

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.829
and on top of it we have our aura navigation bundle and basically menu is

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839
navigation bundle and basically menu is

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:05.910
navigation bundle and basically menu is a tree structure right so we going to

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920
a tree structure right so we going to

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.829
a tree structure right so we going to have a tree of some elements each

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839
have a tree of some elements each

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:10.150
have a tree of some elements each element can have children they can be

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160
element can have children they can be

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.670
element can have children they can be ordered

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680
ordered

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.030
ordered uh and each element has a label

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:15.040
uh and each element has a label

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.430
uh and each element has a label also sometimes is has a route. Why

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440
also sometimes is has a route. Why

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.270
also sometimes is has a route. Why sometimes? Because for example, the

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280
sometimes? Because for example, the

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.950
sometimes? Because for example, the system element doesn't have a route.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960
system element doesn't have a route.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.030
system element doesn't have a route. It's just opening like another level. Uh

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:25.040
It's just opening like another level. Uh

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.630
It's just opening like another level. Uh but this one has a route because it

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640
but this one has a route because it

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.270
but this one has a route because it leads to user um index page

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280
leads to user um index page

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.750
leads to user um index page uh position. So when we have more than

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760
uh position. So when we have more than

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.670
uh position. So when we have more than one elements like here, we can order

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680
one elements like here, we can order

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.870
one elements like here, we can order them in appropriate way. uh specifying

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880
them in appropriate way. uh specifying

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.430
them in appropriate way. uh specifying position

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440
position

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.789
position uh and this uh menu can be defined

01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799
uh and this uh menu can be defined

01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:49.109
uh and this uh menu can be defined inside navigation y file.

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119
inside navigation y file.

01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:51.910
inside navigation y file. Um so normally we specify those elements

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920
Um so normally we specify those elements

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.190
Um so normally we specify those elements in here. This navigation y file is then

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200
in here. This navigation y file is then

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.349
in here. This navigation y file is then uh taken loaded by our navigation bundle

01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359
uh taken loaded by our navigation bundle

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:02.630
uh taken loaded by our navigation bundle and uh menu is rendered.

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640
and uh menu is rendered.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.549
and uh menu is rendered. uh how to create this navigation YAML

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559
uh how to create this navigation YAML

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:07.109
uh how to create this navigation YAML file.

01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119
file.

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:10.789
file. Here is example of some parts from user

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799
Here is example of some parts from user

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:14.069
Here is example of some parts from user bundle. Okay. So in the navigation name

01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079
bundle. Okay. So in the navigation name

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:16.630
bundle. Okay. So in the navigation name space in the menu config name space we

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640
space in the menu config name space we

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.230
space in the menu config name space we first specify items and then we're going

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240
first specify items and then we're going

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.870
first specify items and then we're going to put those items in some particular

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880
to put those items in some particular

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.670
to put those items in some particular place in the tree. Okay. So first we

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680
place in the tree. Okay. So first we

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.910
place in the tree. Okay. So first we need a definition of an item. For

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920
need a definition of an item. For

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.710
need a definition of an item. For example, system tab. It has a label and

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720
example, system tab. It has a label and

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.950
example, system tab. It has a label and this basically goes to this system

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960
this basically goes to this system

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.029
this basically goes to this system element and that's why uh there's no URL

01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039
element and that's why uh there's no URL

01:03:37.039 --> 01:03:39.990
element and that's why uh there's no URL just hash. We can add some uh classes

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000
just hash. We can add some uh classes

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.190
just hash. We can add some uh classes then style it somehow position 100. So

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200
then style it somehow position 100. So

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.670
then style it somehow position 100. So basically it will be probably at the

01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680
basically it will be probably at the

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.230
basically it will be probably at the very very end and it is at the very very

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240
very very end and it is at the very very

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.510
very very end and it is at the very very end of this level. Uh and we can put

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520
end of this level. Uh and we can put

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.630
end of this level. Uh and we can put some extras for example icon gear icon

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640
some extras for example icon gear icon

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.880
some extras for example icon gear icon and yes we do have a gear icon here.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:57.890
and yes we do have a gear icon here.

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.270
and yes we do have a gear icon here. [Music]

01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280
[Music]

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.750
[Music] Uh then uh we may have elements that are

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760
Uh then uh we may have elements that are

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.549
Uh then uh we may have elements that are actually leading somewhere. So like user

01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559
actually leading somewhere. So like user

01:04:06.559 --> 01:04:11.349
actually leading somewhere. So like user list and here a label. So yes basically

01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359
list and here a label. So yes basically

01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:14.710
list and here a label. So yes basically users this is a label uh route because

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720
users this is a label uh route because

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.470
users this is a label uh route because it will lead somewhere. So this is the

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480
it will lead somewhere. So this is the

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.630
it will lead somewhere. So this is the route that we have in our controller.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640
route that we have in our controller.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.630
route that we have in our controller. There was the route annotation and the

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640
There was the route annotation and the

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.309
There was the route annotation and the name of the route and this is exactly

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319
name of the route and this is exactly

01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:25.029
name of the route and this is exactly this. Uh then because we have here a lot

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039
this. Uh then because we have here a lot

01:04:25.039 --> 01:04:27.029
this. Uh then because we have here a lot of elements. So this will have position

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039
of elements. So this will have position

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:31.029
of elements. So this will have position 10, roles will have position 20. So yes,

01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039
10, roles will have position 20. So yes,

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:33.190
10, roles will have position 20. So yes, I have first users and then roles. Okay,

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200
I have first users and then roles. Okay,

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.470
I have first users and then roles. Okay, so that's just the order.

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480
so that's just the order.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.710
so that's just the order. And then additionally to that we can

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720
And then additionally to that we can

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.349
And then additionally to that we can have uh we can specify some description

01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359
have uh we can specify some description

01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:43.589
have uh we can specify some description but what is really nice it's those

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599
but what is really nice it's those

01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.190
but what is really nice it's those routes.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200
routes.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.349
routes. uh so this will act as some kind of a

01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359
uh so this will act as some kind of a

01:04:47.359 --> 01:04:49.750
uh so this will act as some kind of a wild card that will tell us when this

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760
wild card that will tell us when this

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.829
wild card that will tell us when this element should be highlighted because

01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839
element should be highlighted because

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:53.510
element should be highlighted because normally it will be highlighted only

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520
normally it will be highlighted only

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.390
normally it will be highlighted only when I enter or user index but in this

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400
when I enter or user index but in this

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.549
when I enter or user index but in this case when I enter user list okay it's

01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559
case when I enter user list okay it's

01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:02.309
case when I enter user list okay it's highlighted

01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319
highlighted

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:05.750
highlighted yes it it is just yellow but also when

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760
yes it it is just yellow but also when

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.829
yes it it is just yellow but also when I'm when I go to the user view page

01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:14.150
here it would be also nice to have it

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160
here it would be also nice to have it

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.230
here it would be also nice to have it still highlighted ated right? So this is

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240
still highlighted ated right? So this is

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.069
still highlighted ated right? So this is what you can specify in this additional

01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079
what you can specify in this additional

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:20.630
what you can specify in this additional routes part that all the elements all

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640
routes part that all the elements all

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.950
routes part that all the elements all the routes that start from oro user

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960
the routes that start from oro user

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.270
the routes that start from oro user except ro group because they have their

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280
except ro group because they have their

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.829
except ro group because they have their own separate menu elements.

01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839
own separate menu elements.

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:30.309
own separate menu elements. So you can specify uh some wild card

01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319
So you can specify uh some wild card

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:32.390
So you can specify uh some wild card here

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400
here

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.029
here and basically that's it. If you if I

01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039
and basically that's it. If you if I

01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:36.789
and basically that's it. If you if I scroll to the bottom, you'll see that we

01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799
scroll to the bottom, you'll see that we

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:39.270
scroll to the bottom, you'll see that we have only all those elements because

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280
have only all those elements because

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.150
have only all those elements because this is basically what you can specify.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160
this is basically what you can specify.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.069
this is basically what you can specify. Um label route position icon and that's

01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079
Um label route position icon and that's

01:05:46.079 --> 01:05:48.150
Um label route position icon and that's it.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160
it.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.789
it. And then this is definition of element.

01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799
And then this is definition of element.

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.870
And then this is definition of element. It will not be visible anywhere yet.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880
It will not be visible anywhere yet.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.789
It will not be visible anywhere yet. Okay, this is just the definition in of

01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799
Okay, this is just the definition in of

01:05:54.799 --> 01:05:57.670
Okay, this is just the definition in of the item. And we need to put this item

01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680
the item. And we need to put this item

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.270
the item. And we need to put this item in some specific place in the tree.

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280
in some specific place in the tree.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.789
in some specific place in the tree. Uh so we have a three section and uh

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799
Uh so we have a three section and uh

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:08.069
Uh so we have a three section and uh first is the name of our menu then

01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079
first is the name of our menu then

01:06:08.079 --> 01:06:10.470
first is the name of our menu then children system tab children users

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480
children system tab children users

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.029
children system tab children users management children and here is my

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039
management children and here is my

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:17.029
management children and here is my element. Okay this is the one

01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039
element. Okay this is the one

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:20.870
element. Okay this is the one this one user list it's here. How to

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880
this one user list it's here. How to

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.069
this one user list it's here. How to know which uh menu is this? Uh what is

01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079
know which uh menu is this? Uh what is

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.829
know which uh menu is this? Uh what is actually this menu name? We have a list

01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839
actually this menu name? We have a list

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:31.589
actually this menu name? We have a list of all the menus here.

01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:33.589
You can check it in code which is where

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599
You can check it in code which is where

01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:37.349
You can check it in code which is where or you can browse the page uh source to

01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359
or you can browse the page uh source to

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:39.829
or you can browse the page uh source to check which is where basically this main

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839
check which is where basically this main

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:41.750
check which is where basically this main menu here on the left. This is our

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760
menu here on the left. This is our

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.549
menu here on the left. This is our application menu. Okay. So this is the

01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559
application menu. Okay. So this is the

01:06:44.559 --> 01:06:46.470
application menu. Okay. So this is the one you can come here and make sure that

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480
one you can come here and make sure that

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.390
one you can come here and make sure that this is it right. So we have dashboards,

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400
this is it right. So we have dashboards,

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.390
this is it right. So we have dashboards, customers and so on. This is exactly the

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400
customers and so on. This is exactly the

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.349
customers and so on. This is exactly the menu that we have here on the left and

01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359
menu that we have here on the left and

01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:56.309
menu that we have here on the left and under system we have user management and

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319
under system we have user management and

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:59.109
under system we have user management and users. Okay.

01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119
users. Okay.

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:04.069
users. Okay. Um

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:07.109
uh so basically whenever you want to put

01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119
uh so basically whenever you want to put

01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:09.829
uh so basically whenever you want to put something you need to find this tree and

01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839
something you need to find this tree and

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:12.069
something you need to find this tree and put it in appropriate place basically

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079
put it in appropriate place basically

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:14.630
put it in appropriate place basically exactly there where you want it to be.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640
exactly there where you want it to be.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.349
exactly there where you want it to be. Okay. So our user list as well as user

01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359
Okay. So our user list as well as user

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:20.549
Okay. So our user list as well as user roles are in the application menu under

01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559
roles are in the application menu under

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:23.589
roles are in the application menu under system and user management tab. And

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599
system and user management tab. And

01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:28.230
system and user management tab. And that's basically how you specify the

01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240
that's basically how you specify the

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.309
that's basically how you specify the menu element. You just need need to eat

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319
menu element. You just need need to eat

01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:32.230
menu element. You just need need to eat an item and then put it in some

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240
an item and then put it in some

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.710
an item and then put it in some particular place in the tree.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.470
Uh how to customize it. So first of all,

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480
Uh how to customize it. So first of all,

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.510
Uh how to customize it. So first of all, as you already saw, uh we can do it from

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520
as you already saw, uh we can do it from

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.109
as you already saw, uh we can do it from the UI like here.

01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119
the UI like here.

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:50.549
the UI like here. Uh but again, this will be only in your

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559
Uh but again, this will be only in your

01:07:50.559 --> 01:07:55.029
Uh but again, this will be only in your particular database. Uh so if you decide

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039
particular database. Uh so if you decide

01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:56.950
particular database. Uh so if you decide to do it manually then you need to

01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960
to do it manually then you need to

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.710
to do it manually then you need to remember to do it manually on every

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720
remember to do it manually on every

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.270
remember to do it manually on every instance of your project which may not

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280
instance of your project which may not

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.789
instance of your project which may not be so cool but yes you can test here you

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799
be so cool but yes you can test here you

01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:07.349
be so cool but yes you can test here you can check anything so whenever I'm on

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359
can check anything so whenever I'm on

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.910
can check anything so whenever I'm on some particular level

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920
some particular level

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.270
some particular level I can create new menu item I can hide

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280
I can create new menu item I can hide

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.189
I can create new menu item I can hide this menu item or or I can save changes

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199
this menu item or or I can save changes

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:19.910
this menu item or or I can save changes if this menu item was created from the

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920
if this menu item was created from the

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.789
if this menu item was created from the code so from the navigation y file

01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799
code so from the navigation y file

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:25.749
code so from the navigation y file This part is actually not editable. So

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759
This part is actually not editable. So

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:27.910
This part is actually not editable. So you can even here come and notice that

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920
you can even here come and notice that

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.309
you can even here come and notice that this element was for sure created by a

01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319
this element was for sure created by a

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:33.990
this element was for sure created by a code from the navigation y file. If you

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000
code from the navigation y file. If you

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.149
code from the navigation y file. If you create a new item, you can obviously

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159
create a new item, you can obviously

01:08:36.159 --> 01:08:39.829
create a new item, you can obviously edit it and put anything you want in

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839
edit it and put anything you want in

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:41.990
edit it and put anything you want in here.

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000
here.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.510
here. Uh then the second uh

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520
Uh then the second uh

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.550
Uh then the second uh way to customize it it's basically by uh

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560
way to customize it it's basically by uh

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.630
way to customize it it's basically by uh doing it through the navigation y file

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640
doing it through the navigation y file

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.950
doing it through the navigation y file because here you can create new element

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960
because here you can create new element

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.789
because here you can create new element but you can also override existing

01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799
but you can also override existing

01:08:54.799 --> 01:09:00.789
but you can also override existing element uh and basically same as for uh

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799
element uh and basically same as for uh

01:09:00.799 --> 01:09:03.430
element uh and basically same as for uh datagritium file

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440
datagritium file

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.950
datagritium file those files are merged in the bundle

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960
those files are merged in the bundle

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.669
those files are merged in the bundle order. Okay. So if you have a bundle

01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679
order. Okay. So if you have a bundle

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.349
order. Okay. So if you have a bundle that is loaded after all the core

01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359
that is loaded after all the core

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.269
that is loaded after all the core bundles and you want just to modify

01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279
bundles and you want just to modify

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.870
bundles and you want just to modify something or add a new element to

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880
something or add a new element to

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.870
something or add a new element to existing menu then you do it in

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880
existing menu then you do it in

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.430
existing menu then you do it in navigation y file and it will be there

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440
navigation y file and it will be there

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.189
navigation y file and it will be there and I will basically show you that in a

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199
and I will basically show you that in a

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:23.030
and I will basically show you that in a second because we're going to have a

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040
second because we're going to have a

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.110
second because we're going to have a short uh exercise like for me. So I will

01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120
short uh exercise like for me. So I will

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.510
short uh exercise like for me. So I will show you how to modify easily this

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520
show you how to modify easily this

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.910
show you how to modify easily this navigation uh and add some custom

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920
navigation uh and add some custom

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.550
navigation uh and add some custom element. Uh then uh if uh for some

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560
element. Uh then uh if uh for some

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.789
element. Uh then uh if uh for some reason navigation yam it's not enough uh

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799
reason navigation yam it's not enough uh

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:43.030
reason navigation yam it's not enough uh and it can be because navigation yam

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040
and it can be because navigation yam

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.390
and it can be because navigation yam it's like plain right it's flat file so

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400
it's like plain right it's flat file so

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.229
it's like plain right it's flat file so you cannot have conditions there you

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239
you cannot have conditions there you

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:50.390
you cannot have conditions there you cannot say okay add this element but

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400
cannot say okay add this element but

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.550
cannot say okay add this element but only if so if you need some logic behind

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560
only if so if you need some logic behind

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.310
only if so if you need some logic behind creating elements uh then you can create

01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320
creating elements uh then you can create

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.390
creating elements uh then you can create it with a listener and you need to

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400
it with a listener and you need to

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.470
it with a listener and you need to create a listener that will listen to

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480
create a listener that will listen to

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.470
create a listener that will listen to oral menu configure and then menu name.

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480
oral menu configure and then menu name.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.950
oral menu configure and then menu name. So for example for our um test menu this

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960
So for example for our um test menu this

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.270
So for example for our um test menu this will be an event

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280
will be an event

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.110
will be an event or menu configure application menu and

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120
or menu configure application menu and

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.510
or menu configure application menu and example of such a listener. Okay. So we

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520
example of such a listener. Okay. So we

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.790
example of such a listener. Okay. So we get configure menu event and we can

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800
get configure menu event and we can

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.830
get configure menu event and we can basically do anything in here. we can

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840
basically do anything in here. we can

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.790
basically do anything in here. we can check something some ACL's some

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800
check something some ACL's some

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.030
check something some ACL's some additional data

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040
additional data

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.590
additional data uh and then

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600
uh and then

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.630
uh and then where is my build menu so basically then

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640
where is my build menu so basically then

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.630
where is my build menu so basically then we also are adding elements right so the

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640
we also are adding elements right so the

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.030
we also are adding elements right so the same as in the navigation yan file we

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040
same as in the navigation yan file we

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.390
same as in the navigation yan file we have a label we can set extra uh so

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400
have a label we can set extra uh so

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.830
have a label we can set extra uh so exactly like here label extras and so on

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840
exactly like here label extras and so on

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.750
exactly like here label extras and so on so you can do exactly the same from the

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760
so you can do exactly the same from the

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.669
so you can do exactly the same from the listener

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679
listener

01:10:55.679 --> 01:10:58.070
listener uh then if you just wants to build uh

01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080
uh then if you just wants to build uh

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.430
uh then if you just wants to build uh the whole menu from scratch

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440
the whole menu from scratch

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.149
the whole menu from scratch new menu with a builder with a PHP

01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159
new menu with a builder with a PHP

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:06.310
new menu with a builder with a PHP called notw with navigation y file it's

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320
called notw with navigation y file it's

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.189
called notw with navigation y file it's also possible so for this you will need

01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199
also possible so for this you will need

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:11.590
also possible so for this you will need to create a service

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600
to create a service

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.790
to create a service that is tagged as a menu builder give it

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800
that is tagged as a menu builder give it

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.270
that is tagged as a menu builder give it an alias and this will be our uh menu

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280
an alias and this will be our uh menu

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.669
an alias and this will be our uh menu name like the application menu for

01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679
name like the application menu for

01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:22.470
name like the application menu for example and then inside this builder you

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480
example and then inside this builder you

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.470
example and then inside this builder you just do exactly the same so you create

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480
just do exactly the same so you create

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.630
just do exactly the same so you create an element set extra set child uh label

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640
an element set extra set child uh label

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.390
an element set extra set child uh label route extras at position. So basically

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400
route extras at position. So basically

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.229
route extras at position. So basically exactly the same what we have in

01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239
exactly the same what we have in

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:37.110
exactly the same what we have in navigation yam file but from the PHP

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120
navigation yam file but from the PHP

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.870
navigation yam file but from the PHP code

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880
code

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.350
code it's also an option

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.870
um

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880
um

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.790
um page titles. So in our navigation yam

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800
page titles. So in our navigation yam

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.630
page titles. So in our navigation yam file there is a second section on the

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640
file there is a second section on the

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.830
file there is a second section on the same level as uh many config

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840
same level as uh many config

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.149
same level as uh many config and it is called titles

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159
and it is called titles

01:12:00.159 --> 01:12:03.910
and it is called titles and here we specify title uh for each

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920
and here we specify title uh for each

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.430
and here we specify title uh for each page by specifying the route. Okay, so

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440
page by specifying the route. Okay, so

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.270
page by specifying the route. Okay, so we have a route name and then um title.

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280
we have a route name and then um title.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.270
we have a route name and then um title. This goes to the title here on the

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280
This goes to the title here on the

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.590
This goes to the title here on the browser tab at the very top. Okay. So

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600
browser tab at the very top. Okay. So

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.350
browser tab at the very top. Okay. So this is this title.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.430
Uh for the index we do not specify

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440
Uh for the index we do not specify

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.430
Uh for the index we do not specify anything because by default it will take

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440
anything because by default it will take

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.470
anything because by default it will take the plural label of our entity. Okay. So

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480
the plural label of our entity. Okay. So

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.350
the plural label of our entity. Okay. So for user index of the users this will be

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360
for user index of the users this will be

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.870
for user index of the users this will be users.

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880
users.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.709
users. Um okay.

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:41.430
And one last elements are some

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440
And one last elements are some

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.390
And one last elements are some uh menu extensions.

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400
uh menu extensions.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.709
uh menu extensions. So we have uh some of them and this

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719
So we have uh some of them and this

01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:50.950
So we have uh some of them and this particular one one it's uh called

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960
particular one one it's uh called

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.149
particular one one it's uh called routing aware extension

01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159
routing aware extension

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:57.189
routing aware extension and we do have some extensions to for

01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199
and we do have some extensions to for

01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:59.750
and we do have some extensions to for the menu and they are doing different

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760
the menu and they are doing different

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.310
the menu and they are doing different things. This particular one particular

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320
things. This particular one particular

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.910
things. This particular one particular one it's actually checking

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920
one it's actually checking

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.669
one it's actually checking uh if I have access to the route that is

01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679
uh if I have access to the route that is

01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:13.350
uh if I have access to the route that is specified for this item. So imagine the

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360
specified for this item. So imagine the

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.830
specified for this item. So imagine the situation that we have actually you

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840
situation that we have actually you

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.110
situation that we have actually you don't need to imagine it because it's

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120
don't need to imagine it because it's

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.350
don't need to imagine it because it's implemented. We have this user list

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360
implemented. We have this user list

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.030
implemented. We have this user list element and it leads to this route.

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040
element and it leads to this route.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.470
element and it leads to this route. Okay. And this route basically this

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480
Okay. And this route basically this

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.030
Okay. And this route basically this leads to some controller and some action

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040
leads to some controller and some action

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.350
leads to some controller and some action and this controller

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360
and this controller

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.950
and this controller um

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960
um

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.070
um is protected with some ACL.

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080
is protected with some ACL.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.790
is protected with some ACL. Uh so this extension will check if I

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800
Uh so this extension will check if I

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.590
Uh so this extension will check if I have access to this controller and this

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600
have access to this controller and this

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.110
have access to this controller and this action that this route leads to and if

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120
action that this route leads to and if

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.750
action that this route leads to and if not it will hide this item from me.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760
not it will hide this item from me.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.030
not it will hide this item from me. Okay. So you can

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040
Okay. So you can

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.070
Okay. So you can basically if I don't have access to this

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080
basically if I don't have access to this

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.310
basically if I don't have access to this to this controller I will not see the

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320
to this controller I will not see the

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.870
to this controller I will not see the item in the menu and that's that's

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880
item in the menu and that's that's

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.870
item in the menu and that's that's basically all what this extension is

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880
basically all what this extension is

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.110
basically all what this extension is doing.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.790
Okay. And short menu exercise uh to show

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800
Okay. And short menu exercise uh to show

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.430
Okay. And short menu exercise uh to show you that we can really really fast uh

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440
you that we can really really fast uh

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.030
you that we can really really fast uh create some additional menu element and

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040
create some additional menu element and

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.510
create some additional menu element and you'll actually do this on the practice

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520
you'll actually do this on the practice

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.830
you'll actually do this on the practice exactly the same that I will do now just

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840
exactly the same that I will do now just

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.310
exactly the same that I will do now just uh it will lead to different route.

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320
uh it will lead to different route.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.790
uh it will lead to different route. Uh so

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800
Uh so

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.390
Uh so we want to add a new item

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400
we want to add a new item

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:42.149
we want to add a new item with label my custom contacts

01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:46.149
uh position just before contacts and it

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159
uh position just before contacts and it

01:14:46.159 --> 01:14:49.189
uh position just before contacts and it should should lead to or contact index.

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199
should should lead to or contact index.

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:52.390
should should lead to or contact index. Okay. So let's start from creating

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400
Okay. So let's start from creating

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.270
Okay. So let's start from creating navigation yam file in my project in my

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280
navigation yam file in my project in my

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.950
navigation yam file in my project in my bundle. I actually have this file

01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960
bundle. I actually have this file

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.510
bundle. I actually have this file already but

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520
already but

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.709
already but this is just creating a file.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719
this is just creating a file.

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:09.669
this is just creating a file. Let me close everything.

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:12.390
Okay, here under the navigation menu

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400
Okay, here under the navigation menu

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.590
Okay, here under the navigation menu item items I need to create my item.

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600
item items I need to create my item.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.990
item items I need to create my item. Okay, so I will create my item and

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000
Okay, so I will create my item and

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.310
Okay, so I will create my item and this is identifier I will just call it

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320
this is identifier I will just call it

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:30.950
this is identifier I will just call it my custom contacts.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.630
Okay, now I need to specify the label.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640
Okay, now I need to specify the label.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.630
Okay, now I need to specify the label. Normally I will do it with translation

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640
Normally I will do it with translation

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.070
Normally I will do it with translation so it will be really nice. But just for

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080
so it will be really nice. But just for

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.390
so it will be really nice. But just for the sake of this example, I want it to

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400
the sake of this example, I want it to

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.630
the sake of this example, I want it to be faster. So I will just type it here.

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640
be faster. So I will just type it here.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.310
be faster. So I will just type it here. Okay.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320
Okay.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.110
Okay. And then route. So my element will lead

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120
And then route. So my element will lead

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.910
And then route. So my element will lead to some particular page. And we're

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920
to some particular page. And we're

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.790
to some particular page. And we're supposed to it's supposed to lead to the

01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800
supposed to it's supposed to lead to the

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.950
supposed to it's supposed to lead to the contact index page.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.550
Okay. So route is this one. And then it

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560
Okay. So route is this one. And then it

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.750
Okay. So route is this one. And then it needs to be placed uh right just before

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760
needs to be placed uh right just before

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.750
needs to be placed uh right just before the contact. So I will also need to

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760
the contact. So I will also need to

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.229
the contact. So I will also need to specify the position element. But I

01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239
specify the position element. But I

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:14.390
specify the position element. But I don't know

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400
don't know

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.550
don't know what position it should be because I

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560
what position it should be because I

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.390
what position it should be because I don't know what position the contacts

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400
don't know what position the contacts

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.350
don't know what position the contacts element has. So right now I need to find

01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360
element has. So right now I need to find

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.510
element has. So right now I need to find out the definition in the navigation

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520
out the definition in the navigation

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.550
out the definition in the navigation YAML file in the core bundle for this

01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560
YAML file in the core bundle for this

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.030
YAML file in the core bundle for this contacts element. How to do it? I know

01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040
contacts element. How to do it? I know

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.590
contacts element. How to do it? I know that this will be defined in navigation

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600
that this will be defined in navigation

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.350
that this will be defined in navigation y file and I know that

01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360
y file and I know that

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.110
y file and I know that it will have a route

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120
it will have a route

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.550
it will have a route that leads to oral contact index. Okay.

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560
that leads to oral contact index. Okay.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.550
that leads to oral contact index. Okay. So what I'm going to do I'm going to

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560
So what I'm going to do I'm going to

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.390
So what I'm going to do I'm going to find control shift f on my site this oro

01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400
find control shift f on my site this oro

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.669
find control shift f on my site this oro contact index inside

01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679
contact index inside

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:58.310
contact index inside yam file but navigation y file

01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320
yam file but navigation y file

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.149
yam file but navigation y file okay and I have

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159
okay and I have

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.030
okay and I have few elements this is contact bundle and

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040
few elements this is contact bundle and

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.830
few elements this is contact bundle and this is contact bundle so I have two

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840
this is contact bundle so I have two

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.750
this is contact bundle so I have two elements one is some shortcut list

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760
elements one is some shortcut list

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.070
elements one is some shortcut list contacts doesn't seem very correct one

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080
contacts doesn't seem very correct one

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.470
contacts doesn't seem very correct one and this is contact list this is the

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480
and this is contact list this is the

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.870
and this is contact list this is the element that I'm looking for. Okay, so

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880
element that I'm looking for. Okay, so

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.590
element that I'm looking for. Okay, so this is my original element

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600
this is my original element

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.470
this is my original element and I need to put mine

01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480
and I need to put mine

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.390
and I need to put mine I'm forgetful

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400
I'm forgetful

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.910
I'm forgetful just before. Okay, so this one has

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920
just before. Okay, so this one has

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.350
just before. Okay, so this one has position 10. So on my side I'll say

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360
position 10. So on my side I'll say

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.750
position 10. So on my side I'll say position eight. It will be before

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760
position eight. It will be before

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.590
position eight. It will be before eight. Okay, so I have my element but I

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600
eight. Okay, so I have my element but I

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.070
eight. Okay, so I have my element but I still need to put it somewhere in the

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080
still need to put it somewhere in the

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.229
still need to put it somewhere in the tree because now I just created defined

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239
tree because now I just created defined

01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:48.149
tree because now I just created defined the element but it's not displayed

01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159
the element but it's not displayed

01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:50.390
the element but it's not displayed anywhere. So where to put it in the

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400
anywhere. So where to put it in the

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.470
anywhere. So where to put it in the tree? Uh instead of trying to figure out

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480
tree? Uh instead of trying to figure out

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.830
tree? Uh instead of trying to figure out what are the names for those elements, I

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840
what are the names for those elements, I

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.590
what are the names for those elements, I will go the easy way because it's

01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600
will go the easy way because it's

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.750
will go the easy way because it's supposed to be next to the

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760
supposed to be next to the

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.630
supposed to be next to the contact element. So I already opened

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640
contact element. So I already opened

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.709
contact element. So I already opened navigation yam file that creates this

01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719
navigation yam file that creates this

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:10.790
navigation yam file that creates this element. So let's check where is it in

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800
element. So let's check where is it in

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.189
element. So let's check where is it in the tree. Okay, I can just pick in here

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199
the tree. Okay, I can just pick in here

01:18:15.199 --> 01:18:18.630
the tree. Okay, I can just pick in here for this element

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640
for this element

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.070
for this element and it's in the application menu then

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080
and it's in the application menu then

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.149
and it's in the application menu then customers tab.

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159
customers tab.

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:26.709
customers tab. Yeah. And basically here okay so I need

01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719
Yeah. And basically here okay so I need

01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:30.310
Yeah. And basically here okay so I need to put it exactly in this place.

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320
to put it exactly in this place.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.550
to put it exactly in this place. So I'm going to copy it. I actually have

01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560
So I'm going to copy it. I actually have

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.910
So I'm going to copy it. I actually have application menu in my

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920
application menu in my

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.229
application menu in my file. So I need to go relative to

01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239
file. So I need to go relative to

01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:42.709
file. So I need to go relative to application menu. So three application

01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719
application menu. So three application

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:45.669
application menu. So three application menu children

01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679
menu children

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:50.870
menu children customers tab children and my element

01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880
customers tab children and my element

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.390
customers tab children and my element and my element is my custom contacts.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:05.430
Okay. And let's check

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.590
Okay,

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600
Okay,

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.430
Okay, I have this elements and it's leading to

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440
I have this elements and it's leading to

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.510
I have this elements and it's leading to contact. We have some uh now conflict

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520
contact. We have some uh now conflict

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.430
contact. We have some uh now conflict between two elements. So as you can see

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440
between two elements. So as you can see

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.510
between two elements. So as you can see only first one it's highlighted. The

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520
only first one it's highlighted. The

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.229
only first one it's highlighted. The second is not because they both lead to

01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239
second is not because they both lead to

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:21.910
second is not because they both lead to the same place. So only first one was

01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920
the same place. So only first one was

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.990
the same place. So only first one was highlighted

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000
highlighted

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.830
highlighted but it's here. It's right above the

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840
but it's here. It's right above the

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.149
but it's here. It's right above the contacts in in this particular place of

01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159
contacts in in this particular place of

01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:32.550
contacts in in this particular place of the tree. It has this label. It leads to

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560
the tree. It has this label. It leads to

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.870
the tree. It has this label. It leads to uh oral contact index. So basically

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880
uh oral contact index. So basically

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.709
uh oral contact index. So basically that's it right? If you're going to

01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719
that's it right? If you're going to

01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:39.750
that's it right? If you're going to create any element again also creates

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760
create any element again also creates

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.189
create any element again also creates only navigation y file

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199
only navigation y file

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:46.390
only navigation y file define item

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400
define item

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.189
define item put it in appropriate place in a tree.

01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199
put it in appropriate place in a tree.

01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:51.590
put it in appropriate place in a tree. You can always pick for some other

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600
You can always pick for some other

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.149
You can always pick for some other element where is it not to try and

01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159
element where is it not to try and

01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:58.310
element where is it not to try and figure out what is the name of this tab

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320
figure out what is the name of this tab

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.430
figure out what is the name of this tab and it will be there

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.110
documentation for everything that we

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120
documentation for everything that we

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.430
documentation for everything that we talked about. So

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440
talked about. So

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.390
talked about. So those links are for the documentation

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400
those links are for the documentation

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.390
those links are for the documentation about the theory and here you have the

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400
about the theory and here you have the

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.870
about the theory and here you have the YAML reference because we have this data

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880
YAML reference because we have this data

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.990
YAML reference because we have this data grid YAML file. So you here have a link

01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000
grid YAML file. So you here have a link

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.310
grid YAML file. So you here have a link to the reference of every single element

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320
to the reference of every single element

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.270
to the reference of every single element that you can specify in the sum file and

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280
that you can specify in the sum file and

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.030
that you can specify in the sum file and the same the last link the

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040
the same the last link the

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.830
the same the last link the reference to every element that you can

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840
reference to every element that you can

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.149
reference to every element that you can put in navigation y file. Okay.

01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:39.990
Uh yeah best practice. So basically if

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000
Uh yeah best practice. So basically if

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.229
Uh yeah best practice. So basically if you just need to add some simple thing

01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239
you just need to add some simple thing

01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:44.630
you just need to add some simple thing to existing data grid create data grid

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640
to existing data grid create data grid

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.390
to existing data grid create data grid yam file in your bundle make sure your

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400
yam file in your bundle make sure your

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.189
yam file in your bundle make sure your bundle is loaded after the core bundle

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199
bundle is loaded after the core bundle

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:51.110
bundle is loaded after the core bundle and do modifications there because all

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120
and do modifications there because all

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:56.630
and do modifications there because all the data gritium files are merged.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.390
Okay.

01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400
Okay.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.709
Okay. Do you have any questions?

01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:07.830
Uh can you uh can you explain what what

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840
Uh can you uh can you explain what what

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.709
Uh can you uh can you explain what what um extend

01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719
um extend

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:12.310
um extend grids

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320
grids

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.830
grids means

01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840
means

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:17.350
means or extending data grids?

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360
or extending data grids?

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:21.669
or extending data grids? Okay. So basically instead of um

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679
Okay. So basically instead of um

01:21:21.679 --> 01:21:33.430
Okay. So basically instead of um do we have example

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:40.790
integrity file

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.030
um you're talking about this parameter

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040
um you're talking about this parameter

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.430
um you're talking about this parameter right am I correct or in general what

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440
right am I correct or in general what

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:45.830
right am I correct or in general what means

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840
means

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.990
means correct correct no correct correct

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000
correct correct no correct correct

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.790
correct correct no correct correct so uh this is a data grid that is based

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800
so uh this is a data grid that is based

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.149
so uh this is a data grid that is based on some other so basically you don't

01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159
on some other so basically you don't

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:58.390
on some other so basically you don't need to copy this whole configuration

01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400
need to copy this whole configuration

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.310
need to copy this whole configuration from here because as you can see it's

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320
from here because as you can see it's

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.270
from here because as you can see it's long right this one but you just can

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280
long right this one but you just can

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.229
long right this one but you just can create second grid say that it extends

01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239
create second grid say that it extends

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:11.510
create second grid say that it extends this one and only you want to do some

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520
this one and only you want to do some

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.590
this one and only you want to do some modifications like add another two

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600
modifications like add another two

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.390
modifications like add another two columns okay so this data grid as a

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400
columns okay so this data grid as a

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.350
columns okay so this data grid as a result will have all those columns

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360
result will have all those columns

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.550
result will have all those columns actions properties from this one plus on

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560
actions properties from this one plus on

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.709
actions properties from this one plus on top of it all those changes so it's like

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719
top of it all those changes so it's like

01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:28.310
top of it all those changes so it's like class inheritance in PHP.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320
class inheritance in PHP.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.030
class inheritance in PHP. So the question uh it creates a new grid

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040
So the question uh it creates a new grid

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.229
So the question uh it creates a new grid or it

01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239
or it

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.229
or it yes it creates a new grid

01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239
yes it creates a new grid

01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:36.390
yes it creates a new grid and this grid this is identifier of the

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400
and this grid this is identifier of the

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.270
and this grid this is identifier of the grid and this grid is separate to this

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280
grid and this grid is separate to this

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.990
grid and this grid is separate to this grid and separate to base one. So we

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000
grid and separate to base one. So we

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.070
grid and separate to base one. So we have some one base grid and you can use

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080
have some one base grid and you can use

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.390
have some one base grid and you can use it anywhere you want and then we have

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400
it anywhere you want and then we have

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.550
it anywhere you want and then we have two other grids in this particular

01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560
two other grids in this particular

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.550
two other grids in this particular situation that are totally separate

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560
situation that are totally separate

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.310
situation that are totally separate grids. They are based on this one but

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320
grids. They are based on this one but

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.149
grids. They are based on this one but they have some modifications so they

01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159
they have some modifications so they

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:58.629
they have some modifications so they look differently. And this is this grid

01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639
look differently. And this is this grid

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:01.270
look differently. And this is this grid identifier. By this identifier you can

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280
identifier. By this identifier you can

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:08.470
identifier. By this identifier you can display it somewhere.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.270
All right. Thank you.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.030
[Music]

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040
[Music]

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.149
[Music] Maybe you can uh explain what should we

01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159
Maybe you can uh explain what should we

01:23:20.159 --> 01:23:23.910
Maybe you can uh explain what should we do exactly for practice.

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920
do exactly for practice.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.830
do exactly for practice. Yeah. Yeah, I will do that in a second.

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840
Yeah. Yeah, I will do that in a second.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.590
Yeah. Yeah, I will do that in a second. Just waiting. Maybe you have some other

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600
Just waiting. Maybe you have some other

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.390
Just waiting. Maybe you have some other questions to the theory part.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.350
Okay. If not, let's switch for the

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360
Okay. If not, let's switch for the

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.270
Okay. If not, let's switch for the practice. But actually we're going to do

01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280
practice. But actually we're going to do

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.830
practice. But actually we're going to do the practice for the previous topic uh

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840
the practice for the previous topic uh

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.870
the practice for the previous topic uh which was entities and migrations.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.470
Uh and here I have few elements for you

01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480
Uh and here I have few elements for you

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.350
Uh and here I have few elements for you to do and please do them step by step.

01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360
to do and please do them step by step.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.629
to do and please do them step by step. Okay. So don't do installer and

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639
Okay. So don't do installer and

01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:57.750
Okay. So don't do installer and migration at the same uh time. Do this

01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760
migration at the same uh time. Do this

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.830
migration at the same uh time. Do this point by point because this is how you

01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840
point by point because this is how you

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.189
point by point because this is how you will exercise uh adding a migration in

01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199
will exercise uh adding a migration in

01:24:03.199 --> 01:24:05.510
will exercise uh adding a migration in real life. Although in real life this

01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520
real life. Although in real life this

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.070
real life. Although in real life this will be probably after a month not after

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080
will be probably after a month not after

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.229
will be probably after a month not after five minutes but

01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239
five minutes but

01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:12.550
five minutes but uh so first we're going to create

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560
uh so first we're going to create

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.990
uh so first we're going to create usernaming type entity and in general

01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000
usernaming type entity and in general

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.950
usernaming type entity and in general we're going to use this usernaming type

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960
we're going to use this usernaming type

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:22.550
we're going to use this usernaming type uh to be able to specify it for the user

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560
uh to be able to specify it for the user

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.110
uh to be able to specify it for the user entity. So at the very end uh you will

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120
entity. So at the very end uh you will

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.310
entity. So at the very end uh you will be able to go to user page user view

01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320
be able to go to user page user view

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.910
be able to go to user page user view page

01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920
page

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.350
page and have this usernaming type here and

01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360
and have this usernaming type here and

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.070
and have this usernaming type here and you'll be able to select it for user.

01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080
you'll be able to select it for user.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.149
you'll be able to select it for user. Okay. So first for this we need to

01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159
Okay. So first for this we need to

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:43.270
Okay. So first for this we need to create this custom entity.

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280
create this custom entity.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.550
create this custom entity. Um

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.709
so in our bundle in our training bundle

01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719
so in our bundle in our training bundle

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:53.030
so in our bundle in our training bundle we always put entities inside the entity

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040
we always put entities inside the entity

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:58.550
we always put entities inside the entity subdirectory. So you can do the same

01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560
subdirectory. So you can do the same

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.270
subdirectory. So you can do the same create entity that will be configurable

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280
create entity that will be configurable

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.189
create entity that will be configurable and extendable

01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199
and extendable

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.350
and extendable uh and it will be called usernaming type

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360
uh and it will be called usernaming type

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.070
uh and it will be called usernaming type and it will have only three fields ID

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080
and it will have only three fields ID

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.590
and it will have only three fields ID which will be primary key auto

01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600
which will be primary key auto

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.110
which will be primary key auto incremented title string maxlength 64

01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120
incremented title string maxlength 64

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.709
incremented title string maxlength 64 and format max length 255

01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719
and format max length 255

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:19.350
and format max length 255 and I've given you here a link to really

01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360
and I've given you here a link to really

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.070
and I've given you here a link to really simple entity that will be exactly

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080
simple entity that will be exactly

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.750
simple entity that will be exactly almost exactly the same as our one. So

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760
almost exactly the same as our one. So

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.229
almost exactly the same as our one. So if you want to make entity configurable,

01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239
if you want to make entity configurable,

01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:31.750
if you want to make entity configurable, all you need to do is uh add this config

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760
all you need to do is uh add this config

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.070
all you need to do is uh add this config annotation at the top. It has something

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080
annotation at the top. It has something

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.070
annotation at the top. It has something inside. But for us, this will be empty.

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080
inside. But for us, this will be empty.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.070
inside. But for us, this will be empty. So bracket bracket and that's it. This

01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080
So bracket bracket and that's it. This

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.950
So bracket bracket and that's it. This means that entity is configurable. Uh

01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960
means that entity is configurable. Uh

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.590
means that entity is configurable. Uh then uh to make entity extendable, it

01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600
then uh to make entity extendable, it

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.830
then uh to make entity extendable, it needs to implement extend entity

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840
needs to implement extend entity

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.110
needs to implement extend entity interface and use the trait.

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120
interface and use the trait.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.830
interface and use the trait. And then that's it for the creating of

01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840
And then that's it for the creating of

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.430
And then that's it for the creating of entity. And we need to add those fields.

01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440
entity. And we need to add those fields.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.430
entity. And we need to add those fields. So you have very good example here

01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440
So you have very good example here

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.669
So you have very good example here because ID and all the doctrine

01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679
because ID and all the doctrine

01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:03.430
because ID and all the doctrine annotations. This is exactly what you

01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440
annotations. This is exactly what you

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.310
annotations. This is exactly what you need that it's ID column type integer

01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320
need that it's ID column type integer

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.790
need that it's ID column type integer and automatically generated value

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800
and automatically generated value

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.470
and automatically generated value because this is going to be our primary

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480
because this is going to be our primary

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.390
because this is going to be our primary key.

01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400
key.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.830
key. Uh then we have a label.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840
Uh then we have a label.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.669
Uh then we have a label. So for us it will be title field and

01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679
So for us it will be title field and

01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:23.510
So for us it will be title field and format field both string types. So you

01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520
format field both string types. So you

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.189
format field both string types. So you can

01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199
can

01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:27.350
can check here. So for us it will be title

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360
check here. So for us it will be title

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.790
check here. So for us it will be title type string uh just different length and

01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800
type string uh just different length and

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.070
type string uh just different length and second field like this one.

01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080
second field like this one.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.030
second field like this one. Uh then on entity level here also we

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040
Uh then on entity level here also we

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.430
Uh then on entity level here also we need to specify that this is entity for

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440
need to specify that this is entity for

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.149
need to specify that this is entity for doctrine and it's going to be in some

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159
doctrine and it's going to be in some

01:26:42.159 --> 01:26:45.110
doctrine and it's going to be in some kind of a table. So for payment term we

01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120
kind of a table. So for payment term we

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.590
kind of a table. So for payment term we created or a payment term table. We're

01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600
created or a payment term table. We're

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.830
created or a payment term table. We're going to have usernaming type. So let's

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840
going to have usernaming type. So let's

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.310
going to have usernaming type. So let's say training usernaming type table or

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320
say training usernaming type table or

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.070
say training usernaming type table or whatever you prefer. Just remember that

01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080
whatever you prefer. Just remember that

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.669
whatever you prefer. Just remember that this will be the table name that will be

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679
this will be the table name that will be

01:26:55.679 --> 01:27:00.149
this will be the table name that will be created in database. Okay. And for uh ID

01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159
created in database. Okay. And for uh ID

01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:03.030
created in database. Okay. And for uh ID we have a getter. For the string values

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040
we have a getter. For the string values

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.750
we have a getter. For the string values we have getter and setter. Here only one

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760
we have getter and setter. Here only one

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.550
we have getter and setter. Here only one field for us it will be both for title

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560
field for us it will be both for title

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.510
field for us it will be both for title and for format. Okay. So this is you can

01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520
and for format. Okay. So this is you can

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.070
and for format. Okay. So this is you can basically follow this example.

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080
basically follow this example.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.830
basically follow this example. Then uh when this entity is ready uh you

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840
Then uh when this entity is ready uh you

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.990
Then uh when this entity is ready uh you have it as a class and right now you

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000
have it as a class and right now you

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.030
have it as a class and right now you want to create a table for it. So for

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040
want to create a table for it. So for

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.350
want to create a table for it. So for this you need to add installer. You can

01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360
this you need to add installer. You can

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.590
this you need to add installer. You can pick for in the theory slides exactly

01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600
pick for in the theory slides exactly

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.910
pick for in the theory slides exactly where it needs to be or you can just use

01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920
where it needs to be or you can just use

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.830
where it needs to be or you can just use this simple example that I've also

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840
this simple example that I've also

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.830
this simple example that I've also linked here for you. So installer needs

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840
linked here for you. So installer needs

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.030
linked here for you. So installer needs to be in your bundle under the

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040
to be in your bundle under the

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.070
to be in your bundle under the migrations schema.

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080
migrations schema.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.950
migrations schema. Uh and also please follow the naming

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960
Uh and also please follow the naming

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.270
Uh and also please follow the naming type uh conventions so you will not get

01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280
type uh conventions so you will not get

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.950
type uh conventions so you will not get any errors. And inside this installer

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960
any errors. And inside this installer

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.390
any errors. And inside this installer needs to implement installation.

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400
needs to implement installation.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.750
needs to implement installation. I will probably switch to the slides for

01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760
I will probably switch to the slides for

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.430
I will probably switch to the slides for a moment because that's the only thing

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440
a moment because that's the only thing

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.310
a moment because that's the only thing it needs to do.

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320
it needs to do.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.550
it needs to do. Where is my installer? It needs to

01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560
Where is my installer? It needs to

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.350
Where is my installer? It needs to implement the installation

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360
implement the installation

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.470
implement the installation and that's it. Right? So this is a bit

01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480
and that's it. Right? So this is a bit

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.470
and that's it. Right? So this is a bit more complicated. The only thing you

01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480
more complicated. The only thing you

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.790
more complicated. The only thing you need to implement is the installation

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800
need to implement is the installation

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.590
need to implement is the installation coming from oruro migration and then you

01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600
coming from oruro migration and then you

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.110
coming from oruro migration and then you will be forced to

01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120
will be forced to

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.510
will be forced to specify get migration version. For us it

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520
specify get migration version. For us it

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.149
specify get migration version. For us it will be one_0 because for now we don't

01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159
will be one_0 because for now we don't

01:28:28.159 --> 01:28:31.110
will be one_0 because for now we don't have any migration yet. And then you

01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120
have any migration yet. And then you

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.070
have any migration yet. And then you will need to specify the app

01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080
will need to specify the app

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.950
will need to specify the app uh method where you have schema object

01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960
uh method where you have schema object

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.950
uh method where you have schema object and all you will need to do is create a

01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960
and all you will need to do is create a

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.270
and all you will need to do is create a table and add those fields there. So

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280
table and add those fields there. So

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.030
table and add those fields there. So here you have example how to create a

01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040
here you have example how to create a

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.310
here you have example how to create a table on the schema object create table

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320
table on the schema object create table

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.629
table on the schema object create table name you need to take from the entity.

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639
name you need to take from the entity.

01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:53.990
name you need to take from the entity. So this needs to be exactly this value

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.870
and then at column you have exact

01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880
and then at column you have exact

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.830
and then at column you have exact example for the ID it's in integer auto

01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840
example for the ID it's in integer auto

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.110
example for the ID it's in integer auto increment and its primary key and then

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120
increment and its primary key and then

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.550
increment and its primary key and then for title and format you'll do uh pretty

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560
for title and format you'll do uh pretty

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.870
for title and format you'll do uh pretty much the same as here just you need to

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880
much the same as here just you need to

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.310
much the same as here just you need to find somewhere here example how to pass

01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320
find somewhere here example how to pass

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.030
find somewhere here example how to pass uh string

01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040
uh string

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.790
uh string that is

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800
that is

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.110
that is [Music]

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120
[Music]

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.990
[Music] that has max value

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000
that has max value

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.990
that has max value like actually it doesn't have here so

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000
like actually it doesn't have here so

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.149
like actually it doesn't have here so you can check in any files of the

01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159
you can check in any files of the

01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:29.270
you can check in any files of the vendors uh how to specify max length

01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280
vendors uh how to specify max length

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.310
vendors uh how to specify max length here

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.990
um yeah and that would be all after you

01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000
um yeah and that would be all after you

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.189
um yeah and that would be all after you create this installer

01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199
create this installer

01:29:39.199 --> 01:29:40.950
create this installer um

01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960
um

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.110
um please execute this command

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120
please execute this command

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.790
please execute this command or migration load

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800
or migration load

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.750
or migration load But also please first try uh execute it

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760
But also please first try uh execute it

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.149
But also please first try uh execute it with the dry run switch. Okay. So you

01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159
with the dry run switch. Okay. So you

01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:54.390
with the dry run switch. Okay. So you will be sure that your installer is

01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400
will be sure that your installer is

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.870
will be sure that your installer is there and is recognized as a installer.

01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880
there and is recognized as a installer.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.590
there and is recognized as a installer. Then when you execute this method it

01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600
Then when you execute this method it

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.830
Then when you execute this method it will take some time not long but some

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840
will take some time not long but some

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.430
will take some time not long but some time you should see this table in your

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440
time you should see this table in your

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.110
time you should see this table in your database with all the columns etc. So

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120
database with all the columns etc. So

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.590
database with all the columns etc. So this will be the end of this installer.

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600
this will be the end of this installer.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.430
this will be the end of this installer. uh and then I would like you to imagine

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440
uh and then I would like you to imagine

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.990
uh and then I would like you to imagine that uh between this point and the next

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000
that uh between this point and the next

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.070
that uh between this point and the next point sometimes happened that's why

01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080
point sometimes happened that's why

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.470
point sometimes happened that's why we're doing this with the migration and

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480
we're doing this with the migration and

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.830
we're doing this with the migration and now we want to add a relation between

01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840
now we want to add a relation between

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.310
now we want to add a relation between this is core entity and this is our

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320
this is core entity and this is our

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.830
this is core entity and this is our custom that we just created so for this

01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840
custom that we just created so for this

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.430
custom that we just created so for this uh I would like you to do it in the

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440
uh I would like you to do it in the

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.550
uh I would like you to do it in the migration so create directory

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560
migration so create directory

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.910
migration so create directory uh with migration number one

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920
uh with migration number one

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.990
uh with migration number one in case

01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000
in case

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.709
in case you don't know how So here you have the

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719
you don't know how So here you have the

01:30:46.719 --> 01:30:49.110
you don't know how So here you have the directory where to put it. File name is

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120
directory where to put it. File name is

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.189
directory where to put it. File name is up to you. It needs to implement

01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199
up to you. It needs to implement

01:30:51.199 --> 01:30:55.830
up to you. It needs to implement migration. That's it. And inside I'd

01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840
migration. That's it. And inside I'd

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:59.990
migration. That's it. And inside I'd like you to add relation

01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000
like you to add relation

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.149
like you to add relation uh many to one relation from user to

01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159
uh many to one relation from user to

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:06.870
uh many to one relation from user to usernaming type. So user is the owning

01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880
usernaming type. So user is the owning

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.110
usernaming type. So user is the owning side of this. Okay. and you have a link

01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120
side of this. Okay. and you have a link

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.669
side of this. Okay. and you have a link exactly to the

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679
exactly to the

01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:17.030
exactly to the how to do it. So you need to inject

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040
how to do it. So you need to inject

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.709
how to do it. So you need to inject extend extension in your migration

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719
extend extension in your migration

01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:24.229
extend extension in your migration and use the add many to one relation on

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239
and use the add many to one relation on

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:26.709
and use the add many to one relation on top of the schema object owning site on

01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719
top of the schema object owning site on

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:28.790
top of the schema object owning site on our site. It's also our user. So

01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800
our site. It's also our user. So

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.390
our site. It's also our user. So basically yeah and then the name of the

01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400
basically yeah and then the name of the

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.229
basically yeah and then the name of the relation

01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239
relation

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:38.709
relation up to you. uh the inverse site table. So

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719
up to you. uh the inverse site table. So

01:31:38.719 --> 01:31:41.350
up to you. uh the inverse site table. So this will be our entity table usernaming

01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360
this will be our entity table usernaming

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.030
this will be our entity table usernaming type

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040
type

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.270
type and just not forget about adding owner

01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280
and just not forget about adding owner

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.790
and just not forget about adding owner custom. Okay. So basically

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800
custom. Okay. So basically

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.310
custom. Okay. So basically example

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320
example

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.709
example uh oh and this particular element it's

01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719
uh oh and this particular element it's

01:31:52.719 --> 01:31:55.590
uh oh and this particular element it's really also very important uh because

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600
really also very important uh because

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.990
really also very important uh because this is how this entity will be

01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000
this is how this entity will be

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.910
this is how this entity will be displayed in the UI. So now I come here

01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920
displayed in the UI. So now I come here

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.229
displayed in the UI. So now I come here and it's displayed by some parameter. So

01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239
and it's displayed by some parameter. So

01:32:04.239 --> 01:32:06.709
and it's displayed by some parameter. So preferably do not use ID there just

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719
preferably do not use ID there just

01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:09.189
preferably do not use ID there just title otherwise we will have integers

01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199
title otherwise we will have integers

01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:12.470
title otherwise we will have integers here which doesn't make sense really. Uh

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480
here which doesn't make sense really. Uh

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.709
here which doesn't make sense really. Uh so just it will be displayed preferably

01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719
so just it will be displayed preferably

01:32:16.719 --> 01:32:20.709
so just it will be displayed preferably with a title. So here uh this means what

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719
with a title. So here uh this means what

01:32:20.719 --> 01:32:22.709
with a title. So here uh this means what to display in the UI ID doesn't make

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719
to display in the UI ID doesn't make

01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:25.750
to display in the UI ID doesn't make sense. Let's do it with a title.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760
sense. Let's do it with a title.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.189
sense. Let's do it with a title. Uh and after you do this remember to

01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199
Uh and after you do this remember to

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:33.910
Uh and after you do this remember to update your installer with this method.

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920
update your installer with this method.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:37.910
update your installer with this method. and set installer version to one_1.

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920
and set installer version to one_1.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.270
and set installer version to one_1. Again, execute the command

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280
Again, execute the command

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.390
Again, execute the command and you should see this relation. You

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400
and you should see this relation. You

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:48.470
and you should see this relation. You should see uh this element on the user

01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480
should see uh this element on the user

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.950
should see uh this element on the user view. You should see this on the user

01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960
view. You should see this on the user

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.669
view. You should see this on the user grid

01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679
grid

01:32:55.679 --> 01:32:59.510
grid and you should be able to see it also on

01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520
and you should be able to see it also on

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.830
and you should be able to see it also on the user edit page in the additional

01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840
the user edit page in the additional

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.229
the user edit page in the additional section at the bottom. You will have

01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239
section at the bottom. You will have

01:33:04.239 --> 01:33:05.990
section at the bottom. You will have this

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000
this

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.110
this and yours will be empty because your

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120
and yours will be empty because your

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.149
and yours will be empty because your data base is still empty but you at

01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159
data base is still empty but you at

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:15.590
data base is still empty but you at least should have it here uh as a empty

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600
least should have it here uh as a empty

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.550
least should have it here uh as a empty drop list. Okay. And this is the

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560
drop list. Okay. And this is the

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.430
drop list. Okay. And this is the this part and this is basically just

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440
this part and this is basically just

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:27.030
this part and this is basically just creating a data fixture to fill our

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040
creating a data fixture to fill our

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.510
creating a data fixture to fill our database with those values. After you do

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520
database with those values. After you do

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.070
database with those values. After you do this data fixture, you have here very

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080
this data fixture, you have here very

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.149
this data fixture, you have here very good example how to do it, where to put

01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159
good example how to do it, where to put

01:33:34.159 --> 01:33:37.110
good example how to do it, where to put the file.

01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120
the file.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:42.550
the file. Just do this and you should see it in a

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560
Just do this and you should see it in a

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.950
Just do this and you should see it in a database and also you should then have

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960
database and also you should then have

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.070
database and also you should then have here the list of those three elements.

01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080
here the list of those three elements.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.149
here the list of those three elements. Okay, so we're just filling data base

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159
Okay, so we're just filling data base

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:53.189
Okay, so we're just filling data base with some data with this ORM data

01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199
with some data with this ORM data

01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:56.229
with some data with this ORM data fixture and that's basically it. Uh this

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239
fixture and that's basically it. Uh this

01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:59.110
fixture and that's basically it. Uh this is just playing around with PHP and I'm

01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120
is just playing around with PHP and I'm

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.629
is just playing around with PHP and I'm sure you know PHP very very good. So for

01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639
sure you know PHP very very good. So for

01:34:02.639 --> 01:34:06.229
sure you know PHP very very good. So for me it's just yeah in case you have too

01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239
me it's just yeah in case you have too

01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:08.149
me it's just yeah in case you have too much time.

01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159
much time.

01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:10.070
much time. Uh but that's just playing around with

01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080
Uh but that's just playing around with

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.629
Uh but that's just playing around with PHP. Nothing really fancy.

01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639
PHP. Nothing really fancy.

01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:17.510
PHP. Nothing really fancy. Okay. So let's start from creating

01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520
Okay. So let's start from creating

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.709
Okay. So let's start from creating entity and then adding installer to add

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719
entity and then adding installer to add

01:34:20.719 --> 01:34:24.149
entity and then adding installer to add this uh the table to the database and

01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159
this uh the table to the database and

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.790
this uh the table to the database and then please check if everything will be

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800
then please check if everything will be

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.750
then please check if everything will be okay with with it only then please

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760
okay with with it only then please

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.430
okay with with it only then please proceed to this point with creating

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440
proceed to this point with creating

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.270
proceed to this point with creating migration okay

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280
migration okay

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.590
migration okay and I'm here all the time you can take

01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600
and I'm here all the time you can take

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.189
and I'm here all the time you can take breaks whenever you like from now on and

01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199
breaks whenever you like from now on and

01:34:41.199 --> 01:34:43.910
breaks whenever you like from now on and please ask questions if you have any

01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920
please ask questions if you have any

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.910
please ask questions if you have any issues

01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920
issues

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.470
issues Uh, and if I will stand up and go to

01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480
Uh, and if I will stand up and go to

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.470
Uh, and if I will stand up and go to grab a tea, I will just let you know

01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480
grab a tea, I will just let you know

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.110
grab a tea, I will just let you know that I'll be gone for five minutes or

01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:55.120
that I'll be gone for five minutes or

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.910
that I'll be gone for five minutes or something. So, for now, I'm here. And

01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920
something. So, for now, I'm here. And

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.910
something. So, for now, I'm here. And yep.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.590
Uh guys uh by the way uh before you

01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600
Uh guys uh by the way uh before you

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.950
Uh guys uh by the way uh before you execute migration if you still didn't do

01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960
execute migration if you still didn't do

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.669
execute migration if you still didn't do this uh maybe it will be good to create

01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679
this uh maybe it will be good to create

01:35:13.679 --> 01:35:16.709
this uh maybe it will be good to create a database dump because

01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719
a database dump because

01:35:16.719 --> 01:35:19.350
a database dump because later on when you just destroy by

01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360
later on when you just destroy by

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.110
later on when you just destroy by mistake something it will be faster to

01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120
mistake something it will be faster to

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.149
mistake something it will be faster to load the DB dump than to try to fix it.

01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159
load the DB dump than to try to fix it.

01:35:26.159 --> 01:35:28.870
load the DB dump than to try to fix it. So just a hint maybe it should be good

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880
So just a hint maybe it should be good

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.030
So just a hint maybe it should be good to do some database dump before you do

01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040
to do some database dump before you do

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:37.910
to do some database dump before you do the migrations.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.550
and I'm going to grab coffee. So, I'll

01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560
and I'm going to grab coffee. So, I'll

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.350
and I'm going to grab coffee. So, I'll be back in five or 10 minutes. I'll let

01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360
be back in five or 10 minutes. I'll let

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:57.910
be back in five or 10 minutes. I'll let you know when I'll be back.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.229
Yes.

01:36:02.239 --> 01:36:06.390
I've uh created fixture but when I

01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400
I've uh created fixture but when I

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.510
I've uh created fixture but when I execute comment to lot fixture

01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520
execute comment to lot fixture

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.550
execute comment to lot fixture nothing happens and I don't know

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560
nothing happens and I don't know

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.430
nothing happens and I don't know uh you're talking about migrations or

01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440
uh you're talking about migrations or

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.189
uh you're talking about migrations or data fixtures

01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199
data fixtures

01:36:19.199 --> 01:36:21.590
data fixtures data fixure migration

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600

HP bugged because

01:38:03.119 --> 01:38:07.189
HP bugged because yeah maybe sometimes

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:09.350
when I execute

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360
when I execute

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.270
when I execute run

01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280
run

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:19.270
run it shows nothing and without Jun

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:24.310
our migration data load. Okay. And can

01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320
our migration data load. Okay. And can

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.350
our migration data load. Okay. And can you

01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360
you

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.070
you yeah can you check the database

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080
yeah can you check the database

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.629
yeah can you check the database uh search for the table migration data

01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639
uh search for the table migration data

01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:35.109
uh search for the table migration data start typing migration and open or

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119
start typing migration and open or

01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:39.750
start typing migration and open or migrations data

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.149
and sort by ID descending it will be

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159
and sort by ID descending it will be

01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:45.350
and sort by ID descending it will be faster

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:52.229
one. Okay.

01:38:52.239 --> 01:39:03.669

you don't need to do actually anything

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.390
you don't need to do actually anything you need to put it in appropriate

01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400
you need to put it in appropriate

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.030
you need to put it in appropriate directory and just doubleeing migration

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040
directory and just doubleeing migration

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.109
directory and just doubleeing migration schema data.

01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119
schema data.

01:39:17.119 --> 01:39:20.629
schema data. RAM.

01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:23.750
No, here everything it's okay. You're

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760

Okay, first thing you can clear cash

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960
clear cash

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.750
clear cash and recheck, but you shouldn't need to

01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760
and recheck, but you shouldn't need to

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.830
and recheck, but you shouldn't need to do this.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:51.830
Um

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.590
um

um

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.030
um also I work in dev mode.

01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040
also I work in dev mode.

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.709
also I work in dev mode. Yeah. So you shouldn't need to do it but

01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719
Yeah. So you shouldn't need to do it but

01:39:58.719 --> 01:40:01.590
Yeah. So you shouldn't need to do it but cash and asterisk. Yep. Let's just

01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600
cash and asterisk. Yep. Let's just

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.910
cash and asterisk. Yep. Let's just double check

01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920
double check

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.669
double check [Music]

01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679
[Music]

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:13.270
[Music] there's anything there.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.550
I'm just double checking all the

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560
I'm just double checking all the

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.070
I'm just double checking all the comments, but I see that you have it

01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080
comments, but I see that you have it

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.990
comments, but I see that you have it correctly.

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000
correctly.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:34.229
correctly. So,

01:40:34.239 --> 01:40:41.189
then nothing.

01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:44.709
Okay, I see it's it's in migration

01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719
Okay, I see it's it's in migration

01:40:44.719 --> 01:40:47.510
Okay, I see it's it's in migration schema, not in migrations data. The

01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520
schema, not in migrations data. The

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.310
schema, not in migrations data. The directory structure is incorrect. Can

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320
directory structure is incorrect. Can

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.270
directory structure is incorrect. Can you go back to PHP storm?

01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280
you go back to PHP storm?

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.550
you go back to PHP storm? We have it in migration schema data and

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560
We have it in migration schema data and

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.910
We have it in migration schema data and those are two separate sections.

01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920
those are two separate sections.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.750
those are two separate sections. Migration schema is for changes in

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760
Migration schema is for changes in

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.070
Migration schema is for changes in structure and migrations data are now

01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080
structure and migrations data are now

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:04.790
structure and migrations data are now it's

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800
it's

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.590

Yeah. So there was this highlight for a

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.629
Yeah. So there was this highlight for a reason. Okay. Migrations data RM. Now

01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639
reason. Okay. Migrations data RM. Now

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:20.310

You can check now in the user edit page if you have the select in the additional

01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080
if you have the select in the additional

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.750
if you have the select in the additional section at the bottom. So you can just

01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760
section at the bottom. So you can just

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.910
section at the bottom. So you can just play around with it, check if it's

01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920
play around with it, check if it's

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:31.669
play around with it, check if it's there.

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:41.270
I just add

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.709
missing translation but translation file

01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719
missing translation but translation file

01:42:44.719 --> 01:42:47.030
missing translation but translation file it's you

01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040
it's you

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.550
it's you Yeah. Uh, also

01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560
Yeah. Uh, also

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:55.510
Yeah. Uh, also uh I see I see. So I had a question when

01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520
uh I see I see. So I had a question when

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.669
uh I see I see. So I had a question when I set up this um relation.

01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679
I set up this um relation.

01:42:59.679 --> 01:43:03.109
I set up this um relation. I I was not sure what is this label

01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119
I I was not sure what is this label

01:43:03.119 --> 01:43:05.590
I I was not sure what is this label means. It was in the example you

01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600
means. It was in the example you

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.870
means. It was in the example you provided.

01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880
provided.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.189
provided. Yeah, you can specify.

01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199
Yeah, you can specify.

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:11.430
Yeah, you can specify. Yeah, you you know you see but by

01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440
Yeah, you you know you see but by

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.590
Yeah, you you know you see but by default if you don't specify this label

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600
default if you don't specify this label

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.109
default if you don't specify this label there will be this translation key

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119
there will be this translation key

01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:17.270
there will be this translation key created for you. Yes. So it will be this

01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280
created for you. Yes. So it will be this

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.350
created for you. Yes. So it will be this translation key with dots that we have

01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360
translation key with dots that we have

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.629
translation key with dots that we have later in resources translations y file.

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639
later in resources translations y file.

01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:24.790
later in resources translations y file. So you don't need to add this label here

01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800
So you don't need to add this label here

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.470
So you don't need to add this label here because always there will be some

01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480
because always there will be some

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.470
because always there will be some translation

01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480
translation

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.270
translation and um

01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280
and um

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.070
and um if I want to

01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080
if I want to

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.510
if I want to remove this uh what should I do?

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520
remove this uh what should I do?

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.950
remove this uh what should I do? And now you create uh another migration

01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960
And now you create uh another migration

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.149
And now you create uh another migration that will remove this field.

01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159
that will remove this field.

01:43:44.159 --> 01:43:47.350
that will remove this field. Uh remove the field and create it once.

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360
Uh remove the field and create it once.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.430
Uh remove the field and create it once. Uh no no no no. Uh there is um okay I

01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440
Uh no no no no. Uh there is um okay I

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.229
Uh no no no no. Uh there is um okay I will find example and I will send you in

01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239
will find example and I will send you in

01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:57.189
will find example and I will send you in a second because uh there is a way to

01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199
a second because uh there is a way to

01:43:57.199 --> 01:44:01.669
a second because uh there is a way to modify this uh config part uh for entity

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679
modify this uh config part uh for entity

01:44:01.679 --> 01:44:05.750
modify this uh config part uh for entity and for this we have specific queries. I

01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760
and for this we have specific queries. I

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.550
and for this we have specific queries. I just need to find it. It's something

01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560
just need to find it. It's something

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:19.109
just need to find it. It's something with

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:23.430
config update entity config

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440
config update entity config

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:44.470
config update entity config update entity config

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.070
Okay,

01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080
Okay,

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:55.669
Okay, this one update entity.

01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:57.830
Not sure if there will be any examples

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840
Not sure if there will be any examples

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:05.990
Not sure if there will be any examples for this in core.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.669
So there is a table or entity configure.

01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679
So there is a table or entity configure.

01:45:09.679 --> 01:45:11.350
So there is a table or entity configure. Yeah, correct.

01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360
Yeah, correct.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.270
Yeah, correct. Yes. And this is result of all the

01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280
Yes. And this is result of all the

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.590
Yes. And this is result of all the configs that basically you created in

01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600
configs that basically you created in

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.229
configs that basically you created in every of your bundle. So to modify this

01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239
every of your bundle. So to modify this

01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:22.629
every of your bundle. So to modify this you actually need to do a migration. Uh

01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639
you actually need to do a migration. Uh

01:45:22.639 --> 01:45:24.310
you actually need to do a migration. Uh just let me share screen because I just

01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320
just let me share screen because I just

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.470
just let me share screen because I just found it. So I will tell you how to do

01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480
found it. So I will tell you how to do

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.790
found it. So I will tell you how to do it

01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800
it

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.910
it but you need to do migration for it

01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920
but you need to do migration for it

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.750
but you need to do migration for it unfortunately.

01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760
unfortunately.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.669
unfortunately. Yeah not a problem just more practice as

01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679
Yeah not a problem just more practice as

01:45:37.679 --> 01:45:38.950
Yeah not a problem just more practice as I say.

01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960
I say.

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.990
I say. Okay so for this we have

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.390
we have those queries in our entity

01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400
we have those queries in our entity

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.470
we have those queries in our entity config bundle as you can see here to

01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480
config bundle as you can see here to

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.830
config bundle as you can see here to update entity config field values or to

01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840
update entity config field values or to

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.669
update entity config field values or to update entity config. So uh to update

01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679
update entity config. So uh to update

01:45:55.679 --> 01:45:58.550
update entity config. So uh to update this part because this is actually

01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560
this part because this is actually

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.470
this part because this is actually entity

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480
entity

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.470
entity config

01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480
config

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.950
config field. Yes, because you added new field

01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960
field. Yes, because you added new field

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.590
field. Yes, because you added new field to your entity. Okay. So this will be

01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600
to your entity. Okay. So this will be

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.830
to your entity. Okay. So this will be updating entity config field

01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840
updating entity config field

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.189
updating entity config field value. And if I try to search for

01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199
value. And if I try to search for

01:46:15.199 --> 01:46:18.629
value. And if I try to search for usages.

01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:20.390
Okay. So this is the migration that you

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400
Okay. So this is the migration that you

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.189
Okay. So this is the migration that you will need to do inside your app schema.

01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199
will need to do inside your app schema.

01:46:23.199 --> 01:46:27.109
will need to do inside your app schema. and now use the queries object and uh

01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119
and now use the queries object and uh

01:46:27.119 --> 01:46:29.510
and now use the queries object and uh execute this query where you need to

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520
execute this query where you need to

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.709
execute this query where you need to pass uh the class name. So for you this

01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719
pass uh the class name. So for you this

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:35.910
pass uh the class name. So for you this will be user the association name I

01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920
will be user the association name I

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.830
will be user the association name I don't know what was the association name

01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840
don't know what was the association name

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.470
don't know what was the association name from your migration probably user naming

01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480
from your migration probably user naming

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.350
from your migration probably user naming or something like this

01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360
or something like this

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.070
or something like this right then uh appropriate scope code and

01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080
right then uh appropriate scope code and

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.629
right then uh appropriate scope code and value and replace with the value and

01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639
value and replace with the value and

01:46:50.639 --> 01:46:55.189
value and replace with the value and this goes to

01:46:55.199 --> 01:47:01.510
This goes to in your case.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:08.870
I will scroll to top to my migrations.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.669
So the scope will be the first label

01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:20.149
and

01:47:20.159 --> 01:47:22.310
actually you would like to remove it to

01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320
actually you would like to remove it to

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.470
actually you would like to remove it to be honest

01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480
be honest

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.709
be honest this particular section because it's

01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719
this particular section because it's

01:47:26.719 --> 01:47:29.590
this particular section because it's better to have it with translation.

01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600
better to have it with translation.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:34.229
better to have it with translation. Uh okay entity config field.

01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239
Uh okay entity config field.

01:47:34.239 --> 01:47:37.910
Uh okay entity config field. Okay. Can you put in the chat example

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920
Okay. Can you put in the chat example

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.709
Okay. Can you put in the chat example class name so I can

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719
class name so I can

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:43.189
class name so I can Yeah, this was the example

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199
Yeah, this was the example

01:47:43.199 --> 01:47:46.070
Yeah, this was the example and the easy example that I

01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080
and the easy example that I

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.470
and the easy example that I Yeah, I can review it after after the

01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480
Yeah, I can review it after after the

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.910
Yeah, I can review it after after the train.

01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920
train.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.270
train. Yeah. So, this is

01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280
Yeah. So, this is

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:53.189
Yeah. So, this is move forward with the

01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199
move forward with the

01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:56.390
move forward with the example the practice.

01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400
example the practice.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.550
example the practice. This is probably better example uh

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560
This is probably better example uh

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.550
This is probably better example uh because it's easier, right? So, you have

01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560
because it's easier, right? So, you have

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.950
because it's easier, right? So, you have just the scope then code. uh this for

01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960
just the scope then code. uh this for

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.790
just the scope then code. uh this for you will be label and value will be

01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800
you will be label and value will be

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.510
you will be label and value will be empty or you need to change the value.

01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520
empty or you need to change the value.

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.669
empty or you need to change the value. Okay. So this is basically this you just

01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679
Okay. So this is basically this you just

01:48:09.679 --> 01:48:12.470
Okay. So this is basically this you just need to

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480
need to

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.390
need to replace class.

01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400
replace class.

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.990
replace class. Yeah.

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000
Yeah.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.750
Yeah. Um

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.629
okay

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639
okay

01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:23.669
okay here.

01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679
here.

01:48:23.679 --> 01:48:26.950
here. Okay.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.830
And by the way uh this is up to update

01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840
And by the way uh this is up to update

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.070
And by the way uh this is up to update config field value. But you can see that

01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080
config field value. But you can see that

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.390
config field value. But you can see that we have also here some other queries to

01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400
we have also here some other queries to

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:38.870
we have also here some other queries to update entity uh config section. Uh so

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880
update entity uh config section. Uh so

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.550
update entity uh config section. Uh so everything that it's in this this when

01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560
everything that it's in this this when

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.310
everything that it's in this this when you create something like um to enable

01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320
you create something like um to enable

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.590
you create something like um to enable that audi etc this

01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600
that audi etc this

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.910
that audi etc this if you want to change this uh those will

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920
if you want to change this uh those will

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.189
if you want to change this uh those will be the queries that you will use.

01:48:57.199 --> 01:49:00.310
Okay. Uh and about practice do we need

01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320
Okay. Uh and about practice do we need

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:04.550
Okay. Uh and about practice do we need to focus on optional part or we should

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560
to focus on optional part or we should

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.270
to focus on optional part or we should go to another practice topic? What what

01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280
go to another practice topic? What what

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.629
go to another practice topic? What what is it then?

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639
is it then?

01:49:08.639 --> 01:49:12.550
is it then? Uh basically we have the time for this

01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560
Uh basically we have the time for this

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.430
Uh basically we have the time for this practice till the end. Uh so you can try

01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440
practice till the end. Uh so you can try

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.470
practice till the end. Uh so you can try to do the optional part or you can just

01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480
to do the optional part or you can just

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.030
to do the optional part or you can just finish for today. So today the only

01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040
finish for today. So today the only

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.950
finish for today. So today the only thing we still need to do is finish this

01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960
thing we still need to do is finish this

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.189
thing we still need to do is finish this practice. So if you're ready with it

01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199
practice. So if you're ready with it

01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:32.310
practice. So if you're ready with it then

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.149
yeah

01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159
yeah

01:49:34.159 --> 01:49:38.470
yeah yeah I'll try to fix what I did and try

01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480
yeah I'll try to fix what I did and try

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:42.310
yeah I'll try to fix what I did and try optional. Thank you.

01:49:52.239 --> 01:49:58.229
I'm not sure if I was sharing the screen with you.

01:49:58.239 --> 01:50:01.830
Okay. So guys, any other questions? Any

01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840

Nick? Victor, what about you?

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.350
I was bit interrupted.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.870
Okay, you need to go one after the

01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880
Okay, you need to go one after the

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.750
Okay, you need to go one after the other.

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760
other.

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.669
other. Yeah. Yeah. Ju just so I I just bit

Yeah. Yeah. Ju just so I I just bit interrupted. So I'm still on the

01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679
interrupted. So I'm still on the

01:50:23.679 --> 01:50:27.189
interrupted. So I'm still on the creation of the relation and I have some

01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199
creation of the relation and I have some

01:50:27.199 --> 01:50:29.669
creation of the relation and I have some connection issue with the posgress SQL.

01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679
connection issue with the posgress SQL.

01:50:29.679 --> 01:50:32.629
connection issue with the posgress SQL. So I have created the

01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639
So I have created the

01:50:32.639 --> 01:50:37.910
So I have created the uh entity and uh currently finishing

01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920
uh entity and uh currently finishing

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:41.189
uh entity and uh currently finishing this extension interface.

01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199
this extension interface.

01:50:41.199 --> 01:50:45.109
this extension interface. So far it's mostly the same the

01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119
So far it's mostly the same the

01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:47.669
So far it's mostly the same the uh Vladimmer show but the different with

01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679
uh Vladimmer show but the different with

01:50:47.679 --> 01:50:50.950
uh Vladimmer show but the different with naming on the bundle that's

01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960
naming on the bundle that's

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.629
naming on the bundle that's so I I think I will fix it after cuz uh

01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639
so I I think I will fix it after cuz uh

01:50:54.639 --> 01:51:00.149
so I I think I will fix it after cuz uh I don't think I will be getting a time.

01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159
I don't think I will be getting a time.

01:51:00.159 --> 01:51:01.189
I don't think I will be getting a time. Yeah, same for me.

01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199
Yeah, same for me.

01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:04.229
Yeah, same for me. Have an hour for this.

01:51:04.239 --> 01:51:06.310
Yeah, I'm just getting started

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320
Yeah, I'm just getting started

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.350
Yeah, I'm just getting started or

01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360
or

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.629
or Yep.

Okay, guys. So, please continue in case

01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239
Okay, guys. So, please continue in case

01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:18.470
Okay, guys. So, please continue in case you have any questions. I'll I'm here.

01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480
you have any questions. I'll I'm here.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:21.590
you have any questions. I'll I'm here. Uh yeah, I have one more quick question.

01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600
Uh yeah, I have one more quick question.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:24.470
Uh yeah, I have one more quick question. You said that uh it always nice to have

01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480
You said that uh it always nice to have

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.109
You said that uh it always nice to have translations. Can you explain more

01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119
translations. Can you explain more

01:51:27.119 --> 01:51:30.390
translations. Can you explain more detailed about that? What what is

01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400
detailed about that? What what is

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.109
detailed about that? What what is uh so when you create an entity by

01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119
uh so when you create an entity by

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:35.430
uh so when you create an entity by default all its element like all the

01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440
default all its element like all the

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:40.470
default all its element like all the fields uh will uh have translation keys

01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480
fields uh will uh have translation keys

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:44.070
fields uh will uh have translation keys uh created and then uh we have those

01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080
uh created and then uh we have those

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.310
uh created and then uh we have those translation files under resources

01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320
translation files under resources

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.030
translation files under resources translations here.

01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040
translations here.

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.870
translations here. Uh so it depends on

01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880
Uh so it depends on

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:55.270
Uh so it depends on uh and

01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280
uh and

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:58.390
uh and you just need to specify the translation

01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400
you just need to specify the translation

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.030
you just need to specify the translation for this particular key and this key by

01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040
for this particular key and this key by

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.510
for this particular key and this key by default will be used by the application

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520
default will be used by the application

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.589
default will be used by the application and here you specify translation why

01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599
and here you specify translation why

01:52:05.599 --> 01:52:07.669
and here you specify translation why it's nice to have and use those

01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679
it's nice to have and use those

01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:09.750
it's nice to have and use those translation keys everywhere because as

01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760
translation keys everywhere because as

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.350
translation keys everywhere because as you can see we can have different for

01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360
you can see we can have different for

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.430
you can see we can have different for English we can then create uh I know

01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440
English we can then create uh I know

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:19.030
English we can then create uh I know French Spanish etc and And then whenever

01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040
French Spanish etc and And then whenever

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.030
French Spanish etc and And then whenever we change the language uh in our

01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040
we change the language uh in our

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.030
we change the language uh in our storefront those translations will be

01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040
storefront those translations will be

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.189
storefront those translations will be replaced with those values. Right? So in

01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199
replaced with those values. Right? So in

01:52:25.199 --> 01:52:27.510
replaced with those values. Right? So in code there is always translation key

01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520
code there is always translation key

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.629
code there is always translation key string used and then we're replacing it

01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639
string used and then we're replacing it

01:52:30.639 --> 01:52:32.470
string used and then we're replacing it with some real value based on the

01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480
with some real value based on the

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.709
with some real value based on the language.

01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719
language.

01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:36.709
language. So

01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719
So

01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:40.070
So so if I put it into database then it's

01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080
so if I put it into database then it's

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.149
so if I put it into database then it's not translated.

01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159
not translated.

01:52:42.159 --> 01:52:44.229
not translated. No it's not yet. For example, let me

01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239
No it's not yet. For example, let me

01:52:44.239 --> 01:52:46.550
No it's not yet. For example, let me remove this part and I will show you

01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560
remove this part and I will show you

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.070
remove this part and I will show you something.

01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080
something.

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.790
something. And now I'll Oh my god, too many open.

01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800
And now I'll Oh my god, too many open.

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:59.270
And now I'll Oh my god, too many open. Oops. I'll go to my entity management.

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:02.070
It's reloading translation file. So it's

01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080
It's reloading translation file. So it's

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:08.149
It's reloading translation file. So it's taking time. And let's say naming.

01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159
taking time. And let's say naming.

01:53:08.159 --> 01:53:10.709
taking time. And let's say naming. See those are my out of the box by

01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719
See those are my out of the box by

01:53:10.719 --> 01:53:12.709
See those are my out of the box by default created translations. You have

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719
default created translations. You have

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:14.310
default created translations. You have different thing because you specified

01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320
different thing because you specified

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.790
different thing because you specified the label. Actually not for this you

01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800
the label. Actually not for this you

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.470
the label. Actually not for this you should also have because this is for

01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480
should also have because this is for

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.950
should also have because this is for your entity. So there will be some

01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960
your entity. So there will be some

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.750
your entity. So there will be some default translation keys created here

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760
default translation keys created here

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.629
default translation keys created here and for each field we also by default

01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639
and for each field we also by default

01:53:26.639 --> 01:53:29.030
and for each field we also by default have this this goes from this is the

01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040
have this this goes from this is the

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.510
have this this goes from this is the name space. So for me it's inside

01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520
name space. So for me it's inside

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.149
name space. So for me it's inside training namespace. Then my bundle is

01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159
training namespace. Then my bundle is

01:53:34.159 --> 01:53:36.310
training namespace. Then my bundle is usernaming bundle. So this is it. This

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320
usernaming bundle. So this is it. This

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.189
usernaming bundle. So this is it. This is the name of our entity. So for me

01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199
is the name of our entity. So for me

01:53:39.199 --> 01:53:41.510
is the name of our entity. So for me it's usernaming type. Then this is the

01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520
it's usernaming type. Then this is the

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.910
it's usernaming type. Then this is the name of my column. And always we have a

01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920
name of my column. And always we have a

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.229
name of my column. And always we have a label. So by default for all fields and

01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239
label. So by default for all fields and

01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:48.950
label. So by default for all fields and all entities uh there are those

01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960
all entities uh there are those

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.990
all entities uh there are those translation keys uh created and then you

01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000
translation keys uh created and then you

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.350
translation keys uh created and then you just need to take this and create this

01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360
just need to take this and create this

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.589
just need to take this and create this uh messages YAML file here and specify

01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599
uh messages YAML file here and specify

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:02.149
uh messages YAML file here and specify uh values for all those translation keys

01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159
uh values for all those translation keys

01:54:02.159 --> 01:54:04.790
uh values for all those translation keys and application here uses those

01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800
and application here uses those

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:07.270
and application here uses those translation keys and for example now I'm

01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280
translation keys and for example now I'm

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.310
translation keys and for example now I'm English in English so it will replace it

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320
English in English so it will replace it

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.229
English in English so it will replace it with those values but if I switch my

01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239
with those values but if I switch my

01:54:12.239 --> 01:54:14.229
with those values but if I switch my language to Spanish and I create

01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239
language to Spanish and I create

01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:18.870
language to Spanish and I create messages uh as yum and specify some

01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880
messages uh as yum and specify some

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.390
messages uh as yum and specify some Spanish versions of those elements. Then

01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400
Spanish versions of those elements. Then

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:25.750
Spanish versions of those elements. Then I will have uh Spanish labels here.

01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760
I will have uh Spanish labels here.

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.310
I will have uh Spanish labels here. Okay. So that's why we use translations

01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320
Okay. So that's why we use translations

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.589
Okay. So that's why we use translations everywhere.

01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599
everywhere.

01:54:29.599 --> 01:54:32.709
everywhere. Uh sorry, can you click to edit this the

01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719
Uh sorry, can you click to edit this the

01:54:32.719 --> 01:54:36.709
Uh sorry, can you click to edit this the first format field just is it possible

01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719
first format field just is it possible

01:54:36.719 --> 01:54:39.350
first format field just is it possible to set label in admin?

01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360
to set label in admin?

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.750
to set label in admin? Yeah. Yeah.

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760
Yeah. Yeah.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.149
Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah, that's I have translation again

01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159
Uh yeah, that's I have translation again

01:54:44.159 --> 01:54:49.750
Uh yeah, that's I have translation again back again. I um commented it. Okay.

01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760
back again. I um commented it. Okay.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.070
back again. I um commented it. Okay. Uh I mean if you start it in the admin

01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080
Uh I mean if you start it in the admin

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.390
Uh I mean if you start it in the admin panel then translations will not work.

01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400
panel then translations will not work.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.629
panel then translations will not work. Right now we don't have any translation

01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639
Right now we don't have any translation

01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:03.669
Right now we don't have any translation because I just removed this from here.

01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679
because I just removed this from here.

01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:06.790
because I just removed this from here. If I uncomment it uh then it will mean

01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800
If I uncomment it uh then it will mean

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.109
If I uncomment it uh then it will mean that I specified translations for this

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119
that I specified translations for this

01:55:09.119 --> 01:55:12.629
that I specified translations for this field. Okay. So if I now uncomment it,

01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639
field. Okay. So if I now uncomment it,

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:15.910
field. Okay. So if I now uncomment it, so I will have translation for the

01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920
so I will have translation for the

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.189
so I will have translation for the label.

01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199
label.

01:55:17.199 --> 01:55:20.149
label. Yeah. And if you if you do any updates

01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159
Yeah. And if you if you do any updates

01:55:20.159 --> 01:55:24.390
Yeah. And if you if you do any updates in the on that page, it will require

01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400
in the on that page, it will require

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:29.750
in the on that page, it will require that red button. Correct. Update schema.

01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760
that red button. Correct. Update schema.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.390
that red button. Correct. Update schema. Uh no. So it goes this way that

01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400
Uh no. So it goes this way that

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.870
Uh no. So it goes this way that translations are first loaded from this

01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880
translations are first loaded from this

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.669
translations are first loaded from this file and those are default translations

01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679
file and those are default translations

01:55:37.679 --> 01:55:40.070
file and those are default translations and you can also find them for example

01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080
and you can also find them for example

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.750
and you can also find them for example here in system translations

01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760
here in system translations

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:49.109
here in system translations here. Let me search for

01:55:49.119 --> 01:55:52.550
uh title.

01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560
uh title.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.709
uh title. My gosh I want just to copy something.

01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719
My gosh I want just to copy something.

01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:56.709
My gosh I want just to copy something. Okay.

01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719
Okay.

01:55:56.719 --> 01:55:59.990
Okay. Okay. So we have our translation here.

01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000
Okay. So we have our translation here.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.030
Okay. So we have our translation here. If you change anything via the UI, this

01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040
If you change anything via the UI, this

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.589
If you change anything via the UI, this fact will be saved to the database and

01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599
fact will be saved to the database and

01:56:05.599 --> 01:56:08.870
fact will be saved to the database and later on if you do any change in YAM

01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880
later on if you do any change in YAM

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.470
later on if you do any change in YAM file, it will not be seen because

01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480
file, it will not be seen because

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.189
file, it will not be seen because whatever you clicked in the UI, it's

01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199
whatever you clicked in the UI, it's

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:15.830
whatever you clicked in the UI, it's higher priority.

01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840
higher priority.

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.990
higher priority. If you change something,

01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000
If you change something,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:34.310
If you change something, it will just mean that it's

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:42.310
Okay.

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.990
Okay. If you can just uh pick for a

01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000
Okay. If you can just uh pick for a

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.310
Okay. If you can just uh pick for a second, I will also paste it. So, just

01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320
second, I will also paste it. So, just

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.510
second, I will also paste it. So, just to be sure that we understood each other

01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520
to be sure that we understood each other

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.470
to be sure that we understood each other correctly.

01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480
correctly.

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.310
correctly. Okay, I passed something. So if you like

01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320
Okay, I passed something. So if you like

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:06.070
Okay, I passed something. So if you like to change this label that you have,

01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080
to change this label that you have,

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.910
to change this label that you have, this is exactly the query that you will

01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920
this is exactly the query that you will

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.950
this is exactly the query that you will need to implement. So in your migration

01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960
need to implement. So in your migration

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:13.910
need to implement. So in your migration just use this query entity with user

01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920
just use this query entity with user

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.750
just use this query entity with user field name. This was this relation name

01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760
field name. This was this relation name

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:18.470
field name. This was this relation name naming type and then scope is entity and

01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480
naming type and then scope is entity and

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.629
naming type and then scope is entity and this goes exactly from here. This is the

01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639
this goes exactly from here. This is the

01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:24.629
this goes exactly from here. This is the scope. This is the code

01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639
scope. This is the code

01:57:24.639 --> 01:57:27.910
scope. This is the code and this will be the

01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920
and this will be the

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:30.790
and this will be the Yeah, but I need

01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800
Yeah, but I need

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.669
Yeah, but I need I need to remove it instead of

01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679
I need to remove it instead of

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:35.589
I need to remove it instead of uh this is uh for you if you'd like to

01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599
uh this is uh for you if you'd like to

01:57:35.599 --> 01:57:38.229
uh this is uh for you if you'd like to change it. And if you'd like to remove

01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239
change it. And if you'd like to remove

01:57:38.239 --> 01:57:40.950
change it. And if you'd like to remove it, then uh yes, you will need to use

01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960
it, then uh yes, you will need to use

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.189
it, then uh yes, you will need to use another. We have remove

01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199
another. We have remove

01:57:45.199 --> 01:57:51.589
another. We have remove um

01:57:51.599 --> 01:57:56.310
entity config field query. Okay. So for

01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320
entity config field query. Okay. So for

01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:59.990
entity config field query. Okay. So for remove the query will look

01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000
remove the query will look

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:07.030
remove the query will look similar what we have here.

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.310
Last name, field name and new field

01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320
Last name, field name and new field

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:12.310
Last name, field name and new field name.

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320
name.

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.709
name. So I will need to find example for that.

01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719
So I will need to find example for that.

01:58:14.719 --> 01:58:16.950
So I will need to find example for that. Probably filling it with empty value

01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960
Probably filling it with empty value

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.270
Probably filling it with empty value will do the job.

01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280
will do the job.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.669
will do the job. So yeah I will paste you in a moment the

01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679
So yeah I will paste you in a moment the

01:58:21.679 --> 01:58:23.750
So yeah I will paste you in a moment the query for removing but you have already

01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760
query for removing but you have already

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.229
query for removing but you have already on the chat uh this query that you

01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239
on the chat uh this query that you

01:58:26.239 --> 01:58:29.270
on the chat uh this query that you wanted previously to just modify this. I

01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280
wanted previously to just modify this. I

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.350
wanted previously to just modify this. I will just prepare in a second the query

01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360
will just prepare in a second the query

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:33.350
will just prepare in a second the query for removing and I will paste also in

01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360
for removing and I will paste also in

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.790
for removing and I will paste also in the chat. Okay.

01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800
the chat. Okay.

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:46.550
the chat. Okay. Okay.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:50.149
Okay. So, it turns out that you don't

01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159
Okay. So, it turns out that you don't

01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:52.070
Okay. So, it turns out that you don't need to remove it, but you need to fill

01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080
need to remove it, but you need to fill

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.550
need to remove it, but you need to fill it with actual

01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560
it with actual

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.030
it with actual uh

01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040
uh

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.270
uh translational key string. So for example

01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280
translational key string. So for example

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:06.470
translational key string. So for example for all the default uh added fields

01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480
for all the default uh added fields

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.870
for all the default uh added fields this label it's here not like value that

01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880
this label it's here not like value that

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:12.790
this label it's here not like value that you just specified manually type

01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800
you just specified manually type

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.270
you just specified manually type something but this is basically this

01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280
something but this is basically this

01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.430
something but this is basically this translation key so you need to do

01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440
translation key so you need to do

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.270
translation key so you need to do exactly what I have pasted you but

01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280
exactly what I have pasted you but

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:21.990
exactly what I have pasted you but instead of typing some new label just

01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000
instead of typing some new label just

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.149
instead of typing some new label just type there the translation key that you

01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159
type there the translation key that you

01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:28.229
type there the translation key that you would like it to have

01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239
would like it to have

01:59:28.239 --> 01:59:29.589
would like it to have and then put it

01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599
and then put it

01:59:29.599 --> 01:59:32.390
and then put it translations.

01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400
translations.

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:48.229
translations. Thank you.

01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:53.109
Uh yeah,

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:55.189
quick question. How did you get that

01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199
quick question. How did you get that

01:59:55.199 --> 01:59:58.950
quick question. How did you get that field names translation field names?

01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960
field names translation field names?

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.430
field names translation field names? What what did you use to to get the full

02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440
What what did you use to to get the full

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.550
What what did you use to to get the full full path? Uh so by default when you

02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560
full path? Uh so by default when you

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.270
full path? Uh so by default when you don't specify anything

02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280
don't specify anything

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.189
don't specify anything uh then you can always pick

02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199
uh then you can always pick

02:00:11.199 --> 02:00:16.870
uh then you can always pick I am sharing screen in the entity

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:20.550
uh here in the entity management if you

02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560
uh here in the entity management if you

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.790
uh here in the entity management if you find your entity and our was

02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800
find your entity and our was

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.830
find your entity and our was naming and you don't have translations

02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840
naming and you don't have translations

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.390
naming and you don't have translations of course so let me.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.229
You enter the entity and now those

02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239
You enter the entity and now those

02:00:34.239 --> 02:00:36.709
You enter the entity and now those translation keys will be here. If you

02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719
translation keys will be here. If you

02:00:36.719 --> 02:00:38.709
translation keys will be here. If you don't have translations, they will be in

02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719
don't have translations, they will be in

02:00:38.719 --> 02:00:41.189
don't have translations, they will be in here. So if I remove my translations

02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199
here. So if I remove my translations

02:00:41.199 --> 02:00:42.709
here. So if I remove my translations now,

02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719
now,

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:45.990
now, just let me remove everything.

02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000
just let me remove everything.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:55.510
just let me remove everything. Okay. And refresh the page.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:57.270
Okay.

02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280
Okay.

02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.910
Okay. So you have this here.

02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920
So you have this here.

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.149
So you have this here. This is translation key for format, for

02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159
This is translation key for format, for

02:01:02.159 --> 02:01:06.070
This is translation key for format, for ID, for title. Uh this is for the entity

02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080
ID, for title. Uh this is for the entity

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.910
ID, for title. Uh this is for the entity label and then next to it is also always

02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920
label and then next to it is also always

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.750
label and then next to it is also always entity plural label. Okay. So basically

02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760
entity plural label. Okay. So basically

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.189
entity plural label. Okay. So basically this and those three here. So you can

02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199
this and those three here. So you can

02:01:17.199 --> 02:01:26.950
this and those three here. So you can see them here.

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.990
Oh, okay. So, I

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.430
I fixed it. Shall I? Let me share my

02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440
I fixed it. Shall I? Let me share my

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:41.120
I fixed it. Shall I? Let me share my screen.

[Music]

02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080
[Music]

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.709
[Music] So, uh when I tried

02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719
So, uh when I tried

02:01:52.719 --> 02:01:54.790
So, uh when I tried um

02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800
um

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:58.070
um when I when I tried to set this, it

02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080
when I when I tried to set this, it

02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.870
when I when I tried to set this, it didn't help because uh Oro tried to use

02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880
didn't help because uh Oro tried to use

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.830
didn't help because uh Oro tried to use it as a label and

02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840
it as a label and

02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:10.950
it as a label and just uh camel case

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.629
used camel case to translate it. Uh so I

02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639
used camel case to translate it. Uh so I

02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:18.709
used camel case to translate it. Uh so I have set now

02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719
have set now

02:02:18.719 --> 02:02:22.709
have set now and uh the result label was deleted and

02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719
and uh the result label was deleted and

02:02:22.719 --> 02:02:25.510
and uh the result label was deleted and now I see this

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520
now I see this

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:31.990
now I see this uh that's the field name

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.350
this

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.270
Mhm.

02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280
Mhm.

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.070
Mhm. Uh and now I uh looks I just need to

02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080
Uh and now I uh looks I just need to

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.390
Uh and now I uh looks I just need to to set it in the translation and it

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400
to set it in the translation and it

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:45.750
to set it in the translation and it should work.

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760
should work.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:47.109
should work. Yeah, but you don't have really

02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119
Yeah, but you don't have really

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:49.830
Yeah, but you don't have really translation key here. The one that is

02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840
translation key here. The one that is

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.790
translation key here. The one that is long with some dots, right? Because by

02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800
long with some dots, right? Because by

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.629
long with some dots, right? Because by default this field is represented by the

02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639
default this field is represented by the

02:02:56.639 --> 02:02:58.629
default this field is represented by the entity label

02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639
entity label

02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:01.669
entity label key.

02:03:01.679 --> 02:03:06.470
Uh maybe I did it wrong.

02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480
Uh maybe I did it wrong.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.070
Uh maybe I did it wrong. Yeah, this should be this translation.

02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080
Yeah, this should be this translation.

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.270
Yeah, this should be this translation. Okay, I I got what

02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280
Okay, I I got what

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.350
Okay, I I got what it was the wrong key.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.950
All right, I need to modify.

02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960
All right, I need to modify.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.830
All right, I need to modify. Uh yeah,

02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840
Uh yeah,

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.189
Uh yeah, thank you.

02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199
thank you.

02:03:25.199 --> 02:03:28.229
thank you. And by the way, if you're sure that your

02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239
And by the way, if you're sure that your

02:03:28.239 --> 02:03:32.629
And by the way, if you're sure that your uh migration can be executed once more

02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639
uh migration can be executed once more

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:34.950
uh migration can be executed once more and you're sure that there will be no

02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960
and you're sure that there will be no

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:37.030
and you're sure that there will be no issues with it and you're still working

02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040
issues with it and you're still working

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.149
issues with it and you're still working locally, you can always go to oral

02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159
locally, you can always go to oral

02:03:40.159 --> 02:03:42.550
locally, you can always go to oral migrations table and just remove the

02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560
migrations table and just remove the

02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:45.350
migrations table and just remove the entrance because I saw that you created

02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360
entrance because I saw that you created

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.589
entrance because I saw that you created one migration after the other and they

02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599
one migration after the other and they

02:03:47.599 --> 02:03:49.430
one migration after the other and they are all doing actually the same thing,

02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440
are all doing actually the same thing,

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.669
are all doing actually the same thing, right? your migration number three, four

02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679
right? your migration number three, four

02:03:51.679 --> 02:03:54.470
right? your migration number three, four and five are doing the same thing and by

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480
and five are doing the same thing and by

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:57.030
and five are doing the same thing and by the code I can tell that it's safe to

02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040
the code I can tell that it's safe to

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.229
the code I can tell that it's safe to rerun this migration. So locally you can

02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239
rerun this migration. So locally you can

02:04:00.239 --> 02:04:03.189
rerun this migration. So locally you can kind of work around this and instead of

02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199
kind of work around this and instead of

02:04:03.199 --> 02:04:06.950
kind of work around this and instead of creating those uh migrations please open

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960
creating those uh migrations please open

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.270
creating those uh migrations please open oral migration

02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280
oral migration

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.390
oral migration table

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.270
or migrations

02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280
or migrations

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:20.470
or migrations and yeah exactly

02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480
and yeah exactly

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.990
and yeah exactly uh see so you can just remove record uh

02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000
uh see so you can just remove record uh

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.589
uh see so you can just remove record uh 17 16 and 15 and basically it will

02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599
17 16 and 15 and basically it will

02:04:27.599 --> 02:04:29.510
17 16 and 15 and basically it will execute your translation number three

02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520
execute your translation number three

02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.950
execute your translation number three once more. No, do not

02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960
once more. No, do not

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.910
once more. No, do not number two. Do not remove number two.

02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920
number two. Do not remove number two.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:37.990
number two. Do not remove number two. Only three, four, and five. Yeah. So all

02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000
Only three, four, and five. Yeah. So all

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.030
Only three, four, and five. Yeah. So all those rows and basically you can kind of

02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040
those rows and basically you can kind of

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.030
those rows and basically you can kind of cheat the application this way. But

02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040
cheat the application this way. But

02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.950
cheat the application this way. But locally because you're sure that your

02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960
locally because you're sure that your

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.189
locally because you're sure that your migration can be run again and it will

02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199
migration can be run again and it will

02:04:47.199 --> 02:04:49.430
migration can be run again and it will not harm your application, you can

02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440
not harm your application, you can

02:04:49.440 --> 02:05:02.950
not harm your application, you can basically kind of trick it this way.

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.510
Yeah. If you have questions, ask.

02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520
Yeah. If you have questions, ask.

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:08.629
Yeah. If you have questions, ask. [Music]

02:05:10.719 --> 02:05:13.030
Okay. Victor just raised the hand.

02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040
Victor just raised the hand.

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:15.270
Victor just raised the hand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.709
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I have a question there about some It's

02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719
I have a question there about some It's

02:05:18.719 --> 02:05:20.470
I have a question there about some It's unclear for me. Probably it's normal,

02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480
unclear for me. Probably it's normal,

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.189
unclear for me. Probably it's normal, but I'm just curious. Probably I did set

02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199
but I'm just curious. Probably I did set

02:05:23.199 --> 02:05:24.870
but I'm just curious. Probably I did set up something wrong.

02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880
up something wrong.

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.310
up something wrong. Uh so actually I'm doing this migration

02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320
Uh so actually I'm doing this migration

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:31.510
Uh so actually I'm doing this migration load. It always doing some tight

02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520
load. It always doing some tight

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:33.589
load. It always doing some tight migrations which actually was done

02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599
migrations which actually was done

02:05:33.599 --> 02:05:36.070
migrations which actually was done previous and previous time and I'm

02:05:36.070 --> 02:05:36.080
previous and previous time and I'm

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:38.229
previous and previous time and I'm wondering why it happens all the time

02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239
wondering why it happens all the time

02:05:38.239 --> 02:05:41.510
wondering why it happens all the time but it's like the migrations is not

02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520
but it's like the migrations is not

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:44.629
but it's like the migrations is not growing. So when I'm trying to check the

02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639
growing. So when I'm trying to check the

02:05:44.639 --> 02:05:48.229
growing. So when I'm trying to check the uh migration so it's not like it's the

02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239
uh migration so it's not like it's the

02:05:48.239 --> 02:05:50.709
uh migration so it's not like it's the same place but I'm I'm persistently can

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719
same place but I'm I'm persistently can

02:05:50.719 --> 02:05:53.750
same place but I'm I'm persistently can see this going and going again. Mhm.

02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760
see this going and going again. Mhm.

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.910
see this going and going again. Mhm. Yeah. So this is the list of the default

02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920
Yeah. So this is the list of the default

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:59.430
Yeah. So this is the list of the default migrations that will happen always after

02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440
migrations that will happen always after

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:02.390
migrations that will happen always after the those default migrations that sits

02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400
the those default migrations that sits

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:05.990
the those default migrations that sits in those cataloges like v1 something. So

02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000
in those cataloges like v1 something. So

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.629
in those cataloges like v1 something. So those are post migrations that are

02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639
those are post migrations that are

02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:12.310
those are post migrations that are executed on post app action every time

02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320
executed on post app action every time

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.470
executed on post app action every time and those are some migrations from our

02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480
and those are some migrations from our

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:17.430
and those are some migrations from our core bundles that are adding additional

02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440
core bundles that are adding additional

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:20.629
core bundles that are adding additional things. So for example the migration uh

02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639
things. So for example the migration uh

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:23.109
things. So for example the migration uh update entity config migration this one

02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119
update entity config migration this one

02:06:23.119 --> 02:06:25.109
update entity config migration this one goes to the fact that when you add with

02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119
goes to the fact that when you add with

02:06:25.119 --> 02:06:27.990
goes to the fact that when you add with your relation a field and you specify

02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000
your relation a field and you specify

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.550
your relation a field and you specify owner custom in the background

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560
owner custom in the background

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.069
owner custom in the background application needs to put some

02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079
application needs to put some

02:06:32.079 --> 02:06:34.390
application needs to put some configuration values here and there to

02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400
configuration values here and there to

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.589
configuration values here and there to make sure that you will have

02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599
make sure that you will have

02:06:35.599 --> 02:06:37.830
make sure that you will have automatically generated it on the grid

02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840
automatically generated it on the grid

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.910
automatically generated it on the grid or on the view page. So in the

02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920
or on the view page. So in the

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:42.310
or on the view page. So in the background you just created a field but

02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320
background you just created a field but

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:44.470
background you just created a field but in the background there are some actions

02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480
in the background there are some actions

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.350
in the background there are some actions that are happening uh connected to this

02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360
that are happening uh connected to this

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.030
that are happening uh connected to this configurable

02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040
configurable

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:52.229
configurable um functionality that I've shown you and

02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239
um functionality that I've shown you and

02:06:52.239 --> 02:06:54.550
um functionality that I've shown you and extendable functionality. So those are

02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560
extendable functionality. So those are

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:56.790
extendable functionality. So those are just basically some additional things

02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800
just basically some additional things

02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:00.950
just basically some additional things that needs to happen every after every

02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960
that needs to happen every after every

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:03.350
that needs to happen every after every migration. Okay.

02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360
migration. Okay.

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.430
migration. Okay. So I'm just curious because I was

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440
So I'm just curious because I was

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:07.669
So I'm just curious because I was working with this on one class and also

02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679
working with this on one class and also

02:07:07.679 --> 02:07:09.830
working with this on one class and also I'm not sure should we always put this

02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840
I'm not sure should we always put this

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:12.790
I'm not sure should we always put this force or can we can specify only one

02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800
force or can we can specify only one

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.790
force or can we can specify only one migration which I'm interested just to

02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800
migration which I'm interested just to

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:18.709
migration which I'm interested just to speed up the development.

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719
speed up the development.

02:07:18.719 --> 02:07:21.510
speed up the development. So without force uh the migration will

02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520
So without force uh the migration will

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:23.430
So without force uh the migration will not happen.

02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440
not happen.

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:23.910
not happen. Mhm.

02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920
Mhm.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.390
Mhm. Uh because this is the force switch. uh

02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400
Uh because this is the force switch. uh

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:29.109
Uh because this is the force switch. uh you can uh specify yeah some specific

02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119
you can uh specify yeah some specific

02:07:29.119 --> 02:07:31.910
you can uh specify yeah some specific migrations but to be honest it's always

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920
migrations but to be honest it's always

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:34.870
migrations but to be honest it's always safe if application checks everything

02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880
safe if application checks everything

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.470
safe if application checks everything but yeah you can specify bundle for

02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480
but yeah you can specify bundle for

02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:38.069
but yeah you can specify bundle for example

02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079
example

02:07:38.079 --> 02:07:39.350
example like like this

02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360
like like this

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.550
like like this mhm

02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560
mhm

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:43.430
mhm okay so technically if I will try

02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440
okay so technically if I will try

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.830
okay so technically if I will try something like this and then the bundle

02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840
something like this and then the bundle

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:46.950
something like this and then the bundle name I believe I

02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960
name I believe I

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:48.629
name I believe I the bundle name I'm not sure what it

02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639
the bundle name I'm not sure what it

02:07:48.639 --> 02:07:50.629
the bundle name I'm not sure what it will be if it will be just the bundle

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639
will be if it will be just the bundle

02:07:50.639 --> 02:07:53.589
will be if it will be just the bundle name like training usernaming bundle or

02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599
name like training usernaming bundle or

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:55.910
name like training usernaming bundle or maybe the whole path

02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920
maybe the whole path

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:58.310
maybe the whole path You would need to check this.

02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320
You would need to check this.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:13.669
You would need to check this. The bundles

02:08:13.679 --> 02:08:15.669
or this bundles can be

02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679
or this bundles can be

02:08:15.679 --> 02:08:17.830
or this bundles can be basically I'm not sure how to pass this

02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840
basically I'm not sure how to pass this

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.910
basically I'm not sure how to pass this bundle if it should be the bundle name

02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920
bundle if it should be the bundle name

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.229
bundle if it should be the bundle name or the bundle path. you would need to

02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239
or the bundle path. you would need to

02:08:22.239 --> 02:08:24.470
or the bundle path. you would need to check the the implementation of this

02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480
check the the implementation of this

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:27.430
check the the implementation of this command to figure out what it's actually

02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440
command to figure out what it's actually

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:30.390
command to figure out what it's actually requesting inside this parameter because

02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400
requesting inside this parameter because

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:32.149
requesting inside this parameter because I'm not sure

02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159
I'm not sure

02:08:32.159 --> 02:08:35.589
I'm not sure I'm wondering I'm I'm not getting my my

02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599
I'm wondering I'm I'm not getting my my

02:08:35.599 --> 02:08:37.990
I'm wondering I'm I'm not getting my my data uh probably

02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000
data uh probably

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.030
data uh probably okay but for loading uh data fixtures

02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040
okay but for loading uh data fixtures

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:42.950
okay but for loading uh data fixtures there is separate command it's not

02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960
there is separate command it's not

02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.470
there is separate command it's not migration load but migration data load

02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480
migration load but migration data load

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:50.950
migration load but migration data load okay

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:57.830
um colon data col3.

02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.109
Uh

02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119
Uh

02:08:59.119 --> 02:09:00.790
Uh yeah, so it's actually loading it and

02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800
yeah, so it's actually loading it and

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.270
yeah, so it's actually loading it and you have even some error,

02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280
you have even some error,

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.709
you have even some error, right?

02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719
right?

02:09:04.719 --> 02:09:06.629
right? Your entity is not configurable, which

02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639
Your entity is not configurable, which

02:09:06.639 --> 02:09:08.390
Your entity is not configurable, which means that in your entity class, you

02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400
means that in your entity class, you

02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:11.189
means that in your entity class, you don't have this at config annotation at

02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199
don't have this at config annotation at

02:09:11.199 --> 02:09:12.950
don't have this at config annotation at the top,

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960
the top,

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:22.310
the top, right? I was it was Yeah, I was not

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.510
like this one.

02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520
like this one.

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.350
like this one. Uh, no, you need to edit your entity

02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360
Uh, no, you need to edit your entity

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.589
Uh, no, you need to edit your entity class. Training bundle usernaming entity

02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599
class. Training bundle usernaming entity

02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:31.109
class. Training bundle usernaming entity usernaming type. It's on red. So, your

02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119
usernaming type. It's on red. So, your

02:09:31.119 --> 02:09:34.629

02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639
entity class, scroll to the top

02:09:34.639 --> 02:09:38.950
entity class, scroll to the top and above the usernaming type, you need

02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960
and above the usernaming type, you need

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:47.669
and above the usernaming type, you need to also tag it with at config.

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:49.350
Not sure how to do it with the

02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360
Not sure how to do it with the

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.149
Not sure how to do it with the parameters.

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159
parameters.

02:09:50.159 --> 02:09:53.750
parameters. Yeah, I I probably need get this example

02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760
Yeah, I I probably need get this example

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.870
Yeah, I I probably need get this example which we have for the payment term.

02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880
which we have for the payment term.

02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.589
which we have for the payment term. Mhm.

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599
Mhm.

02:09:57.599 --> 02:09:58.390
Mhm. This one.

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400
This one.

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.790
This one. Yep.

02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800
Yep.

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.310
Yep. This means that it

02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320
This means that it

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:04.790
This means that it I need

02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800
I need

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.310
I need you can leave it empty. No, just leave

02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320
you can leave it empty. No, just leave

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:17.669
you can leave it empty. No, just leave it empty. Add config and that's it.

02:10:17.679 --> 02:10:21.750
Okay. But wait a moment.

02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760
Okay. But wait a moment.

02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:26.310
Okay. But wait a moment. You're using examples from our master

02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320
You're using examples from our master

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.350
You're using examples from our master which is I believe not released version

02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360
which is I believe not released version

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.030
which is I believe not released version six of Oro

02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040
six of Oro

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.510
six of Oro and in previous versions we're not

02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520
and in previous versions we're not

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.550
and in previous versions we're not allowing those parameters to be this way

02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560
allowing those parameters to be this way

02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.990
allowing those parameters to be this way yet. You'll be able to use those from

02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000
yet. You'll be able to use those from

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.790
yet. You'll be able to use those from the next version of Oro. We're still in

02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800
the next version of Oro. We're still in

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.430
the next version of Oro. We're still in the 5.1 which means that you cannot use

02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440
the 5.1 which means that you cannot use

02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:47.750
the 5.1 which means that you cannot use this notation. You need to use the

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760
this notation. You need to use the

02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.990
this notation. You need to use the notation that

02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000
notation that

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.870
notation that can you open the link for slides.

02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880
can you open the link for slides.

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:55.189
can you open the link for slides. Yeah, your slide link is wrong. It goes

02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199
Yeah, your slide link is wrong. It goes

02:10:55.199 --> 02:10:55.830
Yeah, your slide link is wrong. It goes to master.

02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840
to master.

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.069
to master. So not this notation exactly.

02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079
So not this notation exactly.

02:10:58.079 --> 02:10:59.830
So not this notation exactly. Yeah, I ran into the same problem but I

02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840
Yeah, I ran into the same problem but I

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:03.109
Yeah, I ran into the same problem but I realized it was on the wrong branch.

02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119
realized it was on the wrong branch.

02:11:03.119 --> 02:11:05.510
realized it was on the wrong branch. Yeah, I basically saw that and that's

02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520
Yeah, I basically saw that and that's

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.189
Yeah, I basically saw that and that's okay for me because already we are

02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199
okay for me because already we are

02:11:07.199 --> 02:11:09.990
okay for me because already we are already working with it. But yeah,

02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000
already working with it. But yeah,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.830
already working with it. But yeah, version six is coming soon. Probably

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840
version six is coming soon. Probably

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.550
version six is coming soon. Probably this month or next. So, and we're going.

02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560
this month or next. So, and we're going.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.430
this month or next. So, and we're going. Okay. So, what I I should check there's

02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440
Okay. So, what I I should check there's

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.550
Okay. So, what I I should check there's uh yes, open the simple example entity.

02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560
uh yes, open the simple example entity.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.350
uh yes, open the simple example entity. Yes. On the second slide, this Yeah.

02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360
Yes. On the second slide, this Yeah.

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.589
Yes. On the second slide, this Yeah. payment term. Scroll to the top.

02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599
payment term. Scroll to the top.

02:11:27.599 --> 02:11:28.629
payment term. Scroll to the top. Remember this one?

02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639
Remember this one?

02:11:28.639 --> 02:11:32.069
Remember this one? This one. Yep. And I think ah I'll put

02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079
This one. Yep. And I think ah I'll put

02:11:32.079 --> 02:11:34.470
This one. Yep. And I think ah I'll put the link to master which I need.

02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480
the link to master which I need.

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.709
the link to master which I need. I can change it to 5.1.

02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719
I can change it to 5.1.

02:11:36.719 --> 02:11:40.470
I can change it to 5.1. Change to 5.1. Which one? Anyone?

02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480
Change to 5.1. Which one? Anyone?

02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:43.430
Change to 5.1. Which one? Anyone? 5.1. Just five. 5.1. Not alpha, not

02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440
5.1. Just five. 5.1. Not alpha, not

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.510
5.1. Just five. 5.1. Not alpha, not beta. Just 5.1. Start typing. And yeah,

02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520
beta. Just 5.1. Start typing. And yeah,

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.510
beta. Just 5.1. Start typing. And yeah, I need to fix the slides.

02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520
I need to fix the slides.

02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:51.270
I need to fix the slides. And uh

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280
And uh

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.109
And uh so this notation. Okay. So, we still

02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119
so this notation. Okay. So, we still

02:11:53.119 --> 02:11:57.189
so this notation. Okay. So, we still have something in comments and yeah.

02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199
have something in comments and yeah.

02:11:57.199 --> 02:12:00.069
have something in comments and yeah. Huh. I'm wondering why.

02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079
Huh. I'm wondering why.

02:12:00.079 --> 02:12:03.430
Huh. I'm wondering why. I'm wondering why it's a problem in

02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440
I'm wondering why it's a problem in

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.109
I'm wondering why it's a problem in this. it. No, it's just the fact that we

02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119
this. it. No, it's just the fact that we

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.910
this. it. No, it's just the fact that we are not supporting this yet in the 5.1

02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920
are not supporting this yet in the 5.1

02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.990
are not supporting this yet in the 5.1 and training is on the 5.1. Uh we

02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000
and training is on the 5.1. Uh we

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.189
and training is on the 5.1. Uh we I'm just wondering so

02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199
I'm just wondering so

02:12:17.199 --> 02:12:19.030
I'm just wondering so it should be comment right.

02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040
it should be comment right.

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.189
it should be comment right. Mhm.

02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199
Mhm.

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:29.430
Mhm. It was not using this one as well.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:31.510
So you need to change everything to this

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520
So you need to change everything to this

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.030
So you need to change everything to this different notation and I will fix the

02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040
different notation and I will fix the

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:39.030
different notation and I will fix the slides. I've changed all the links to

02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040
slides. I've changed all the links to

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:40.950
slides. I've changed all the links to but I probably forgot about the links

02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960
but I probably forgot about the links

02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.149
but I probably forgot about the links from the practice slides in the series

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159
from the practice slides in the series

02:12:44.159 --> 02:13:09.990
from the practice slides in the series slides. You should have it. Okay.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.950
Yeah, it's using different names.

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.430
I'm not sure why it's highlighting this

02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440
I'm not sure why it's highlighting this

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.629
I'm not sure why it's highlighting this stuff import

02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639
stuff import

02:13:20.639 --> 02:13:22.790
stuff import because you didn't import it. Yeah, now

02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800
because you didn't import it. Yeah, now

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:23.669
because you didn't import it. Yeah, now it's okay.

02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679
it's okay.

02:13:23.679 --> 02:13:27.030
it's okay. And then I need to change this stuff.

02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040
And then I need to change this stuff.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.470
And then I need to change this stuff. Yeah, you need to change all of them. So

02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480
Yeah, you need to change all of them. So

02:13:30.480 --> 02:14:00.870
Yeah, you need to change all of them. So could be

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.430
It needs to be at RM and you need to

02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440
It needs to be at RM and you need to

02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:05.830
It needs to be at RM and you need to also import it.

02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840
also import it.

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.750
also import it. You can please track in the example.

02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760
You can please track in the example.

02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:14.580
You can please track in the example. You should have it imported but

02:14:14.590 --> 02:14:30.790
[Music]

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.430
I think that's it. So I can try again.

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440
I think that's it. So I can try again.

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.229
I think that's it. So I can try again. Uh you still don't you're not using at

02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239
Uh you still don't you're not using at

02:14:38.239 --> 02:14:48.709
Uh you still don't you're not using at everywhere above the in ID.

02:14:48.719 --> 02:14:53.350
And I think that the type

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:56.470
um needs to be just string not taken

02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480
um needs to be just string not taken

02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:00.390
um needs to be just string not taken from types

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:02.229
constant

02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239
constant

02:15:02.239 --> 02:15:32.590
constant type string.

[Music]

02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:39.510
31.

02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520
31.

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:55.109
31. It's taking something.

02:15:55.119 --> 02:16:00.950
Okay, it's no the gather is okay but

02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960
Okay, it's no the gather is okay but

02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:05.910
Okay, it's no the gather is okay but maybe it bothers single quote

02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920
maybe it bothers single quote

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.189
maybe it bothers single quote in the orm definitions the single quote

02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199
in the orm definitions the single quote

02:16:11.199 --> 02:16:11.830
in the orm definitions the single quote uh no

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840
uh no

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:13.750
uh no it shouldn't be dollar sign name it

02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760
it shouldn't be dollar sign name it

02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:18.229
it shouldn't be dollar sign name it should just be this name

02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239
should just be this name

02:16:18.239 --> 02:16:20.790
should just be this name uh it means it was get set methods from

02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800
uh it means it was get set methods from

02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:23.270
uh it means it was get set methods from the interface I had to implement in

02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280
the interface I had to implement in

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:24.790
the interface I had to implement in order to get

02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800
order to get

02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:29.030
order to get oh there's a trait you need to add

02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040
oh there's a trait you need to add

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.910
oh there's a trait you need to add instead of implementing those yourself

02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920
instead of implementing those yourself

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:33.990
instead of implementing those yourself you don't need get set default uh

02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000
you don't need get set default uh

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.790
you don't need get set default uh methods you need to can you scroll to to

02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800
methods you need to can you scroll to to

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:39.270
methods you need to can you scroll to to top

02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280
top

02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:41.349
top you need to also use a trait can you go

02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359
you need to also use a trait can you go

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:45.509
you need to also use a trait can you go back to example of this payment term

02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519
back to example of this payment term

02:16:45.519 --> 02:16:48.629
back to example of this payment term Uh yeah, you need to use extend entity

02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639
Uh yeah, you need to use extend entity

02:16:48.639 --> 02:16:51.589
Uh yeah, you need to use extend entity trait. It's much longer than just get

02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599
trait. It's much longer than just get

02:16:51.599 --> 02:16:54.309
trait. It's much longer than just get and set method. It's like long and just

02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319
and set method. It's like long and just

02:16:54.319 --> 02:16:57.190
and set method. It's like long and just remove everything else than getter and

02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200
remove everything else than getter and

02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.669
remove everything else than getter and setter for particular fields. So just

02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679
setter for particular fields. So just

02:16:59.679 --> 02:17:09.190
setter for particular fields. So just remove all this and yes get title

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:12.389
and I think that it bothers about the

02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399
and I think that it bothers about the

02:17:12.399 --> 02:17:14.950
and I think that it bothers about the single quote sign right explicit plain

02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960
single quote sign right explicit plain

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:18.070
single quote sign right explicit plain value got single quote maybe you should

02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080
value got single quote maybe you should

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.469
value got single quote maybe you should change all this to double quotes the

02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479
change all this to double quotes the

02:17:20.479 --> 02:17:22.870
change all this to double quotes the oram annotations

02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880
oram annotations

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:23.669
oram annotations that

02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679
that

02:17:23.679 --> 02:17:26.230
that yeah and the format

02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240
yeah and the format

02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.709
yeah and the format it looks like this bothers

02:17:30.719 --> 02:17:39.110
him.

02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:43.429
Okay. So as finally we have entity is

02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439
Okay. So as finally we have entity is

02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:51.030
Okay. So as finally we have entity is not configurable

02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:54.309
at config and it comes from

02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319
at config and it comes from

02:17:54.319 --> 02:17:58.469
at config and it comes from what is the import entity config bundle

02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479
what is the import entity config bundle

02:17:58.479 --> 02:18:01.750
what is the import entity config bundle metadata annotation config.

02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760
metadata annotation config.

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:08.950
metadata annotation config. Okay.

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.950
Uh, it's okay. Everything is okay.

02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960
Uh, it's okay. Everything is okay.

02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:18.070
Uh, it's okay. Everything is okay. Maybe.

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.910
Can you clear the cache?

02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920
Can you clear the cache?

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.790
Can you clear the cache? I wonder what happened before

02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800
I wonder what happened before

02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:28.709
I wonder what happened before when you already had entities, but

02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719
when you already had entities, but

02:18:28.719 --> 02:18:32.950
when you already had entities, but it didn't have any annotations there.

02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960
it didn't have any annotations there.

02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:35.589
it didn't have any annotations there. Just clear the cache for now and we'll

02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599
Just clear the cache for now and we'll

02:18:35.599 --> 02:18:54.230
Just clear the cache for now and we'll see.

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.950
Ah, okay. I know what happened because

02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960
Ah, okay. I know what happened because

02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:59.429
Ah, okay. I know what happened because you just basically added this config

02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439
you just basically added this config

02:18:59.439 --> 02:19:02.309
you just basically added this config section and this is executed when you uh

02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319
section and this is executed when you uh

02:19:02.319 --> 02:19:05.589
section and this is executed when you uh run migrations but now not when you load

02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599
run migrations but now not when you load

02:19:05.599 --> 02:19:08.389
run migrations but now not when you load data. Can you execute one more command

02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399
data. Can you execute one more command

02:19:08.399 --> 02:19:09.750
data. Can you execute one more command to

02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760
to

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:11.910
to could I remove the previous migration?

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920
could I remove the previous migration?

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:14.150
could I remove the previous migration? No, no, no, no, no. Just whenever you

02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160
No, no, no, no, no. Just whenever you

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.389
No, no, no, no, no. Just whenever you modify this at config section, you need

02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399
modify this at config section, you need

02:19:16.399 --> 02:19:20.469
modify this at config section, you need to additionally execute the command uh

02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479
to additionally execute the command uh

02:19:20.479 --> 02:19:22.150
to additionally execute the command uh update config.

02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160
update config.

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.070
update config. I'm just typing searching for it.

02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080
I'm just typing searching for it.

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:24.549
I'm just typing searching for it. Right. Right.

02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559
Right. Right.

02:19:24.559 --> 02:19:26.389
Right. Right. I don't remember it by heart, believe

02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399
I don't remember it by heart, believe

02:19:26.399 --> 02:19:29.110
I don't remember it by heart, believe me.

02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120
me.

02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:32.469
me. Uh so it's anti oral entity config

02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479
Uh so it's anti oral entity config

02:19:32.479 --> 02:19:37.030
Uh so it's anti oral entity config update.

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.429
Yeah, just wait for cache. This is

02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439
Yeah, just wait for cache. This is

02:19:39.439 --> 02:19:42.150
Yeah, just wait for cache. This is exactly why I remove cache because I

02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160
exactly why I remove cache because I

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:44.309
exactly why I remove cache because I really don't want wait like waiting

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319
really don't want wait like waiting

02:19:44.319 --> 02:19:47.030
really don't want wait like waiting twice. First for clearing cache and then

02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040
twice. First for clearing cache and then

02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:48.950
twice. First for clearing cache and then when I refresh the page for building the

02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960
when I refresh the page for building the

02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:55.270
when I refresh the page for building the cache. So I always remove.

02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.349
Yeah, it's pretty slow for me. Sorry for

02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359
Yeah, it's pretty slow for me. Sorry for

02:19:57.359 --> 02:20:00.630
Yeah, it's pretty slow for me. Sorry for this doesn't apply that it hits the

02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640
this doesn't apply that it hits the

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:03.270
this doesn't apply that it hits the requirements but

02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280
requirements but

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:07.910
requirements but okay I will paste you the comment

02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920
okay I will paste you the comment

02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:11.030
okay I will paste you the comment uh in the stack sorry not in stack in

02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040
uh in the stack sorry not in stack in

02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:11.670
uh in the stack sorry not in stack in the chat

02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680
the chat

02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:14.309
the chat also I had some other question there

02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:14.319
also I had some other question there

02:20:14.319 --> 02:20:16.710
also I had some other question there about this relation so first of this all

02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720
about this relation so first of this all

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.910
about this relation so first of this all of this stuff do we need this or not

02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920
of this stuff do we need this or not

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:24.630
of this stuff do we need this or not yes you need this otherwise uh

02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640
yes you need this otherwise uh

02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:26.870
yes you need this otherwise uh you will not be able to even create this

02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880
you will not be able to even create this

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:28.150
you will not be able to even create this relation because you're creating

02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160
relation because you're creating

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:33.030
relation because you're creating relation between core entity. So

02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040
relation between core entity. So

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:37.349
relation between core entity. So okay so you tried to load data fixtures

02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359
okay so you tried to load data fixtures

02:20:37.359 --> 02:20:40.710
okay so you tried to load data fixtures but do you basically did you load it the

02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720
but do you basically did you load it the

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:41.190
but do you basically did you load it the migration?

02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200
migration?

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.270
migration? Yeah it was loaded actually without this

02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280
Yeah it was loaded actually without this

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:44.870
Yeah it was loaded actually without this stuff.

02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880
stuff.

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:47.429
stuff. So I can remove it. I mean I can remove

02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439
So I can remove it. I mean I can remove

02:20:47.439 --> 02:20:49.990
So I can remove it. I mean I can remove this stuff from there. It will not help

02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000
this stuff from there. It will not help

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.750
this stuff from there. It will not help you because then you will also need to

02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760
you because then you will also need to

02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:54.950
you because then you will also need to modify a lot of rows in the entity

02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960
modify a lot of rows in the entity

02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:57.750
modify a lot of rows in the entity config table in the entity config field

02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760
config table in the entity config field

02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.510
config table in the entity config field tables all those data that are

02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520
tables all those data that are

02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:02.790
tables all those data that are serialized there. So basically faster

02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800
serialized there. So basically faster

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:06.550
serialized there. So basically faster for you will be to load DB dump if you

02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560
for you will be to load DB dump if you

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.550
for you will be to load DB dump if you created one. If not

02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560
created one. If not

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:12.710
created one. If not it's easy for me to re reload uh just

02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720
it's easy for me to re reload uh just

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:14.389
it's easy for me to re reload uh just installation doesn't have anything

02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399
installation doesn't have anything

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:16.150
installation doesn't have anything there. But the question there I can

02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160
there. But the question there I can

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.750
there. But the question there I can change the type. I'm just I'm just not

02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760
change the type. I'm just I'm just not

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:21.750
change the type. I'm just I'm just not wondering what does it means what this

02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760
wondering what does it means what this

02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:23.990
wondering what does it means what this part

02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000
part

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.040
part extend

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:25.050
extend

02:21:25.050 --> 02:21:26.469
extend [Music]

02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479
[Music]

02:21:26.479 --> 02:21:28.790
[Music] owner customer.

02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800
owner customer.

02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.110
owner customer. Uh okay so let me share screen and I'll

02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120
Uh okay so let me share screen and I'll

02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:44.790
Uh okay so let me share screen and I'll go back to the slides.

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:47.830
Okay.

02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:55.110
Uh so this all goes to this part of

02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:58.389
uh the extended entities. Okay. So the

02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399
uh the extended entities. Okay. So the

02:21:58.399 --> 02:22:00.630
uh the extended entities. Okay. So the idea behind is that you're trying to

02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640
idea behind is that you're trying to

02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:05.270
idea behind is that you're trying to create a relation between core entity

02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280
create a relation between core entity

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:09.110
create a relation between core entity and uh between your custom entity. So

02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120
and uh between your custom entity. So

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:12.070
and uh between your custom entity. So you cannot go to the core entity and

02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080
you cannot go to the core entity and

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:14.950
you cannot go to the core entity and edit it there and create a field there

02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960
edit it there and create a field there

02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:17.830
edit it there and create a field there etc. So you cannot do it. So we created

02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840
etc. So you cannot do it. So we created

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:21.510
etc. So you cannot do it. So we created this extended entities functionality

02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520
this extended entities functionality

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.670
this extended entities functionality and if entity is extended and it's

02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680
and if entity is extended and it's

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.429
and if entity is extended and it's extended when it implements this

02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439
extended when it implements this

02:22:25.439 --> 02:22:28.389
extended when it implements this interface and it uses this trait then

02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399
interface and it uses this trait then

02:22:28.399 --> 02:22:30.469
interface and it uses this trait then you can create relation between those

02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479
you can create relation between those

02:22:30.479 --> 02:22:33.349
you can create relation between those two extended entities. And to create

02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359
two extended entities. And to create

02:22:33.359 --> 02:22:35.190
two extended entities. And to create this relation

02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200
this relation

02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:39.270
this relation and this is exactly the example that or

02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280
and this is exactly the example that or

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.230
and this is exactly the example that or I can open it from this slide

02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240
I can open it from this slide

02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.950
I can open it from this slide here. It was nicer.

02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960
here. It was nicer.

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:48.070
here. It was nicer. Uh so the only thing you need to do is

02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080
Uh so the only thing you need to do is

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.309
Uh so the only thing you need to do is basically to create one to many relation

02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319
basically to create one to many relation

02:22:50.319 --> 02:22:52.790
basically to create one to many relation or to create a field on some existing

02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800
or to create a field on some existing

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.230
or to create a field on some existing entity in core uh is to use this method

02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240
entity in core uh is to use this method

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:59.110
entity in core uh is to use this method and this particular section tells you

02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120
and this particular section tells you

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:02.950
and this particular section tells you that uh this will be using the extended

02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960
that uh this will be using the extended

02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:06.070
that uh this will be using the extended uh entity functionality and owner custom

02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080
uh entity functionality and owner custom

02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:08.950
uh entity functionality and owner custom gives you the poss

02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960
gives you the poss

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.030
gives you the poss whenever you create this relation or

02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040
whenever you create this relation or

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.830
whenever you create this relation or this field uh or in the background will

02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840
this field uh or in the background will

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:16.230
this field uh or in the background will automatically generate for you this

02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240
automatically generate for you this

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:18.790
automatically generate for you this field on the view page on the create

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800
field on the view page on the create

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:21.750
field on the view page on the create page. So on all the form types and also

02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760
page. So on all the form types and also

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:26.070
page. So on all the form types and also on the greet. Okay. So um you you're not

02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080
on the greet. Okay. So um you you're not

02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.110
on the greet. Okay. So um you you're not editing core files because you cannot

02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120
editing core files because you cannot

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:33.429
editing core files because you cannot edit core files but by specifying this

02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439
edit core files but by specifying this

02:23:33.439 --> 02:23:35.590
edit core files but by specifying this configuration part to Oro you're telling

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600
configuration part to Oro you're telling

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:38.070
configuration part to Oro you're telling Oro okay autogenerate a lot of stuff for

02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080
Oro okay autogenerate a lot of stuff for

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.150
Oro okay autogenerate a lot of stuff for me. So as you can see the only thing

02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160
me. So as you can see the only thing

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.950
me. So as you can see the only thing that we did in our practice

02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960
that we did in our practice

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.750
that we did in our practice uh was to

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760
uh was to

02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:49.429
uh was to I have too many open tabs.

02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439
I have too many open tabs.

02:23:49.439 --> 02:23:53.990
I have too many open tabs. We just added this relation to our user.

02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000
We just added this relation to our user.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.230
We just added this relation to our user. We didn't modify user entity. We didn't

02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240
We didn't modify user entity. We didn't

02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:58.790
We didn't modify user entity. We didn't modify user view. We didn't modify users

02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800
modify user view. We didn't modify users

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:02.230
modify user view. We didn't modify users greet. Nothing. We just specify hey or

02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240
greet. Nothing. We just specify hey or

02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:04.230
greet. Nothing. We just specify hey or this is extended entity. Please generate

02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240
this is extended entity. Please generate

02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.750
this is extended entity. Please generate everything for me because this means

02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760
everything for me because this means

02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:07.830
everything for me because this means owner custom.

02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840
owner custom.

02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:11.750
owner custom. And by default if you do this what you

02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760
And by default if you do this what you

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:16.630
And by default if you do this what you will have for free is uh you will have

02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640
will have for free is uh you will have

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.710
will have for free is uh you will have this field

02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720
this field

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:21.750
this field on the view page here. And remember we

02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760
on the view page here. And remember we

02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:24.550
on the view page here. And remember we didn't edit the user view template. We

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560
didn't edit the user view template. We

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.910
didn't edit the user view template. We didn't do it. We only specified here

02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920
didn't do it. We only specified here

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:29.990
didn't do it. We only specified here this owner custom. There is a second

02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000
this owner custom. There is a second

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.790
this owner custom. There is a second owner and it's called owner system and

02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800
owner and it's called owner system and

02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:35.990
owner and it's called owner system and it means do not do anything for me.

02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000
it means do not do anything for me.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.070
it means do not do anything for me. Okay. So you will not get this on the

02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080
Okay. So you will not get this on the

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:39.990
Okay. So you will not get this on the grid. You will not get on the view page.

02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000
grid. You will not get on the view page.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.150
grid. You will not get on the view page. But if you use owner custom then you

02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160
But if you use owner custom then you

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.469
But if you use owner custom then you will have it here. You will have it on

02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479
will have it here. You will have it on

02:24:44.479 --> 02:24:47.270
will have it here. You will have it on the edit page in the additional section

02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280
the edit page in the additional section

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:49.270
the edit page in the additional section and you will also have it on the grid

02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280
and you will also have it on the grid

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:52.389
and you will also have it on the grid for free. Here is the column. Okay. So

02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399
for free. Here is the column. Okay. So

02:24:52.399 --> 02:24:56.469
for free. Here is the column. Okay. So this means that we are using um this

02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479
this means that we are using um this

02:24:56.479 --> 02:24:59.349
this means that we are using um this extended functionality. We are adding

02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359
extended functionality. We are adding

02:24:59.359 --> 02:25:01.750
extended functionality. We are adding relation between core entity that we are

02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760
relation between core entity that we are

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:04.550
relation between core entity that we are not able to edit easily but Oro will

02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560
not able to edit easily but Oro will

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.630
not able to edit easily but Oro will just generate a lot of stuff for us.

02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640
just generate a lot of stuff for us.

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:11.030
just generate a lot of stuff for us. Oh my god.

02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040
Oh my god.

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.270
Oh my god. And what about the other attribute? I

02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280
And what about the other attribute? I

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:17.110
And what about the other attribute? I believe it was entity label.

02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120
believe it was entity label.

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.110
believe it was entity label. Uh yeah that's just some additional

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120
Uh yeah that's just some additional

02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:21.990
Uh yeah that's just some additional attributes that you can pass here. So

02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000
attributes that you can pass here. So

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.630
attributes that you can pass here. So you can pass uh many different

02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640
you can pass uh many different

02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.190
you can pass uh many different attributes like for the entity this will

02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200
attributes like for the entity this will

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:30.150
attributes like for the entity this will be a label right. So this will be

02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160
be a label right. So this will be

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.230
be a label right. So this will be instead of translation

02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240
instead of translation

02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.830
instead of translation um actually Vladimir had this uh issue

02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840
um actually Vladimir had this uh issue

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:38.870
um actually Vladimir had this uh issue because he specified this and this label

02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880
because he specified this and this label

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:42.710
because he specified this and this label is then displayed for example

02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720
is then displayed for example

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:45.750
is then displayed for example here when I go to entity management and

02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760
here when I go to entity management and

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.510
here when I go to entity management and I will try to find it those are the

02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520
I will try to find it those are the

02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:49.750
I will try to find it those are the entity labels. Okay. So this those are

02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760
entity labels. Okay. So this those are

02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:52.230
entity labels. Okay. So this those are entity labels.

02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240
entity labels.

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:56.230
entity labels. So you can specify it also with in here.

02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240
So you can specify it also with in here.

02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.710
So you can specify it also with in here. You can also specify much more fields

02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720
You can also specify much more fields

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:01.910
You can also specify much more fields like we had some examples here.

02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920
like we had some examples here.

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:05.510
like we had some examples here. Um I did the label there and it still

02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520
Um I did the label there and it still

02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.990
Um I did the label there and it still has like the translation

02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000
has like the translation

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.550
has like the translation label or like it the label when I look

02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560
label or like it the label when I look

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:12.150
label or like it the label when I look at it in the back office shows like the

02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160
at it in the back office shows like the

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:14.950
at it in the back office shows like the translation key. So it seems like that

02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960
translation key. So it seems like that

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:18.309
translation key. So it seems like that label isn't ending up there.

02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319
label isn't ending up there.

02:26:18.319 --> 02:26:20.469
label isn't ending up there. Or if maybe I did it wrong.

02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479
Or if maybe I did it wrong.

02:26:20.479 --> 02:26:23.110
Or if maybe I did it wrong. You need to check

02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120
You need to check

02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.270
You need to check uh it in table probably for starter and

02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280
uh it in table probably for starter and

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:31.750
uh it in table probably for starter and then if it's in uh in table you have the

02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760
then if it's in uh in table you have the

02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:33.270
then if it's in uh in table you have the translation.

02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280
translation.

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:36.389
translation. Okay. Uh or entity config. Let's check

02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399
Okay. Uh or entity config. Let's check

02:26:36.399 --> 02:26:38.950
Okay. Uh or entity config. Let's check for

02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960
for

02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.510
for this username type is 240.

02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:45.750
Okay. So we have those three elements

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760
Okay. So we have those three elements

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:49.190
Okay. So we have those three elements here. Oro entity config field

02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200
here. Oro entity config field

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.950
here. Oro entity config field and uh let's take title

02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960
and uh let's take title

02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:54.950
and uh let's take title or actually I can take oralo entity

02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960
or actually I can take oralo entity

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:56.550
or actually I can take oralo entity config.

02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560
config.

02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.670
config. Let's check what is here for me.

02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:07.270
My gosh.

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:17.590
Okay.

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.349
entity.

02:27:21.359 --> 02:27:24.550
So I have in entity label I have here

02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560
So I have in entity label I have here

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:27.190
So I have in entity label I have here translation. So it will use translation

02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200
translation. So it will use translation

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.910
translation. So it will use translation in theory and this is exactly basically

02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920
in theory and this is exactly basically

02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:31.750
in theory and this is exactly basically in theory and also Vladimir actually

02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760
in theory and also Vladimir actually

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.750
in theory and also Vladimir actually checked that because he when he added

02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760
checked that because he when he added

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:37.429
checked that because he when he added this part here

02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439
this part here

02:27:37.439 --> 02:27:40.230
this part here the entity label will be this what you

02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240
the entity label will be this what you

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.190
the entity label will be this what you specify here. So instead of having then

02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200
specify here. So instead of having then

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.590
specify here. So instead of having then automatically created uh translation

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600
automatically created uh translation

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.309
automatically created uh translation key, he had here uh this manually typed

02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319
key, he had here uh this manually typed

02:27:50.319 --> 02:27:51.190
key, he had here uh this manually typed label.

02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200
label.

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:53.110
label. Okay. And what I'm saying is I did what

02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120
Okay. And what I'm saying is I did what

02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:56.630
Okay. And what I'm saying is I did what you said. I put a label in my relation

02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640
you said. I put a label in my relation

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:58.469
you said. I put a label in my relation like as a part of the configuration and

02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479
like as a part of the configuration and

02:27:58.479 --> 02:28:00.950
like as a part of the configuration and I still got a translation key here.

02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960
I still got a translation key here.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.670
I still got a translation key here. So my label still ended up translation.

02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680
So my label still ended up translation.

02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:05.750
So my label still ended up translation. Check this data. And if you do have

02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760
Check this data. And if you do have

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.389
Check this data. And if you do have translation here, that means that for

02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399
translation here, that means that for

02:28:08.399 --> 02:28:10.790
translation here, that means that for some reason this was not applied

02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800
some reason this was not applied

02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.670
some reason this was not applied correctly. Okay. And you may now wonder

02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680
correctly. Okay. And you may now wonder

02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:16.389
correctly. Okay. And you may now wonder for what reason and probably it will be

02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399
for what reason and probably it will be

02:28:16.399 --> 02:28:18.309
for what reason and probably it will be difficult to figure out what happened

02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319
difficult to figure out what happened

02:28:18.319 --> 02:28:20.389
difficult to figure out what happened because it already happened.

02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399
because it already happened.

02:28:20.399 --> 02:28:23.190
because it already happened. Uh so yeah, you can always use this

02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200
Uh so yeah, you can always use this

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.270
Uh so yeah, you can always use this query that I pasted on the chat to

02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:25.280
query that I pasted on the chat to

02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:27.349
query that I pasted on the chat to update this value value in case you

02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359
update this value value in case you

02:28:27.359 --> 02:28:28.389
update this value value in case you really need it.

02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399
really need it.

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.510
really need it. It's probably fine anyway.

02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520
It's probably fine anyway.

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.110
It's probably fine anyway. It's good to have it with a translation.

02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120
It's good to have it with a translation.

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:33.110
It's good to have it with a translation. Yeah, cuz you can just put a translation

02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120
Yeah, cuz you can just put a translation

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.750
Yeah, cuz you can just put a translation in for it and then it's translatable

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760
in for it and then it's translatable

02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:37.670
in for it and then it's translatable instead of hardcode it.

02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680
instead of hardcode it.

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.230
instead of hardcode it. Okay,

02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240
Okay,

02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:40.230
Okay, I just wanted to call that out since it

02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240
I just wanted to call that out since it

02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:42.150
I just wanted to call that out since it I did do that and it still kind of ended

02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160
I did do that and it still kind of ended

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:43.670
I did do that and it still kind of ended up in the same thing that Vladimir ran

02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680
up in the same thing that Vladimir ran

02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.110
up in the same thing that Vladimir ran into. So,

02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120
into. So,

02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:48.950
into. So, so that is weird. Uh, so I would check

02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960
so that is weird. Uh, so I would check

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:51.510
so that is weird. Uh, so I would check it here probably. Here you have the

02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520
it here probably. Here you have the

02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.830
it here probably. Here you have the translation key and something weird

02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840
translation key and something weird

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:54.550
translation key and something weird happened.

02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560
happened.

02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:56.710
happened. Yeah, the entity itself and all the

02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720
Yeah, the entity itself and all the

02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:58.870
Yeah, the entity itself and all the fields also ended up with translation

02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880
fields also ended up with translation

02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:01.510
fields also ended up with translation labels. So,

02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520
labels. So,

02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:04.710
labels. So, Yeah, all the fields too because uh you

02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720
Yeah, all the fields too because uh you

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:07.910
Yeah, all the fields too because uh you basically didn't specify

02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920
basically didn't specify

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:11.910
basically didn't specify this while creating um this table

02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920
this while creating um this table

02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:13.590
this while creating um this table because you just created this table

02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600
because you just created this table

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:14.870
because you just created this table normally

02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880
normally

02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:17.670
normally uh by

02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680
uh by

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:20.230
uh by is that during the installer okay so I

02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240
is that during the installer okay so I

02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.790
is that during the installer okay so I have to specify a label here

02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800
have to specify a label here

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:25.110
have to specify a label here yeah here we don't pass any additional

02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120
yeah here we don't pass any additional

02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:27.270
yeah here we don't pass any additional options so basically all the labels

02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280
options so basically all the labels

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:29.110
options so basically all the labels translation keys are generated

02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120
translation keys are generated

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.150
translation keys are generated automatically bas bas on this uh rules.

02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160
automatically bas bas on this uh rules.

02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.469
automatically bas bas on this uh rules. So we're going to have training dot

02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479
So we're going to have training dot

02:29:34.479 --> 02:29:36.389
So we're going to have training dot usernaming dot

02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399
usernaming dot

02:29:36.399 --> 02:29:39.110
usernaming dot usernaming type dot then field name dot

02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120
usernaming type dot then field name dot

02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.230
usernaming type dot then field name dot label.

02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240
label.

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.750
label. Okay. All right. That makes sense.

02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760
Okay. All right. That makes sense.

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:44.230
Okay. All right. That makes sense. And it's always the same generated the

02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240
And it's always the same generated the

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.550
And it's always the same generated the same way. So you can figure it out. But

02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560
same way. So you can figure it out. But

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.870
same way. So you can figure it out. But also normally when I create custom

02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880
also normally when I create custom

02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.990
also normally when I create custom entity I just do the entity uh do the

02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000
entity I just do the entity uh do the

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.349
entity I just do the entity uh do the installer and then basically go to

02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359
installer and then basically go to

02:29:55.359 --> 02:29:56.710
installer and then basically go to just add the translation

02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720
just add the translation

02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:58.550
just add the translation and check the translation keys.

02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560
and check the translation keys.

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:01.190
and check the translation keys. Okay. There is also a test that is

02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200
Okay. There is also a test that is

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.710
Okay. There is also a test that is checking if those translations are

02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720
checking if those translations are

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:06.469
checking if those translations are available,

02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479
available,

02:30:06.479 --> 02:30:09.110
available, but I would need to search for it. It

02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120
but I would need to search for it. It

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.110
but I would need to search for it. It sits in one of our B.

02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120
sits in one of our B.

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.790
sits in one of our B. So, typically it's best just create the

02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800
So, typically it's best just create the

02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:14.550
So, typically it's best just create the entities and then you come back and add

02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560
entities and then you come back and add

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:18.070
entities and then you come back and add the translations. Um, and that's kind of

02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080
the translations. Um, and that's kind of

02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.389
the translations. Um, and that's kind of the preferred way.

02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399
the preferred way.

02:30:20.399 --> 02:30:20.630
the preferred way. Okay.

02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640
Okay.

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:23.750
Okay. Yeah, we always have them here. I will

02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760
Yeah, we always have them here. I will

02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:27.190
Yeah, we always have them here. I will uncomment it to have translations, not

02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200
uncomment it to have translations, not

02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:29.510
uncomment it to have translations, not keys.

02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520
keys.

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:34.469
keys. Okay.

02:30:34.479 --> 02:30:40.070
Okay. So, uh tomorrow we may start from

02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080
Okay. So, uh tomorrow we may start from

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:41.910
Okay. So, uh tomorrow we may start from checking this on your site in case

02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920
checking this on your site in case

02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:43.910
checking this on your site in case you'll have any other questions, but can

02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920
you'll have any other questions, but can

02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:46.309
you'll have any other questions, but can I more or less assume that you

02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319
I more or less assume that you

02:30:46.319 --> 02:30:48.469
I more or less assume that you understand what's going on and you have

02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479
understand what's going on and you have

02:30:48.479 --> 02:30:51.750
understand what's going on and you have just some uh

02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760
just some uh

02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:56.150
just some uh small issues.

02:30:56.160 --> 02:30:59.190
Yeah. So from my side I'm I'm

02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200
Yeah. So from my side I'm I'm

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:01.270
Yeah. So from my side I'm I'm understand that I need to specify this

02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280
understand that I need to specify this

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:03.349
understand that I need to specify this custom and then it will be filled out

02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359
custom and then it will be filled out

02:31:03.359 --> 02:31:06.389
custom and then it will be filled out and also I need to refresh that base

02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399
and also I need to refresh that base

02:31:06.399 --> 02:31:08.630
and also I need to refresh that base because it didn't created me a lot of

02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640
because it didn't created me a lot of

02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:12.070
because it didn't created me a lot of the stuff which it should create is this

02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080
the stuff which it should create is this

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:14.150
the stuff which it should create is this first creation of the

02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160
first creation of the

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:16.469
first creation of the field. Yeah, for you it will be better

02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479
field. Yeah, for you it will be better

02:31:16.479 --> 02:31:19.590
field. Yeah, for you it will be better to just start restart the database and

02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600
to just start restart the database and

02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:22.150
to just start restart the database and and then as far understood from the uh

02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160
and then as far understood from the uh

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:25.510
and then as far understood from the uh session is load demer uh I mean when you

02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520
session is load demer uh I mean when you

02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.670
session is load demer uh I mean when you describing so the the next optional

02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680
describing so the the next optional

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:30.950
describing so the the next optional topic is just uh use one more update and

02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960
topic is just uh use one more update and

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.270
topic is just uh use one more update and specify this query you specificate in

02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280
specify this query you specificate in

02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:34.389
specify this query you specificate in the

02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399
the

02:31:34.399 --> 02:31:36.150
the no that was just some additional part

02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160
no that was just some additional part

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:39.110
no that was just some additional part because Vladimir did this uh label and

02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120
because Vladimir did this uh label and

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:40.950
because Vladimir did this uh label and he actually wanted to know how to change

02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960
he actually wanted to know how to change

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:42.710
he actually wanted to know how to change it for the future. This was something

02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720
it for the future. This was something

02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:45.030
it for the future. This was something totally outside of the

02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040
totally outside of the

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:47.190
totally outside of the This is not related. I I'm just

02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200
This is not related. I I'm just

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:52.469
This is not related. I I'm just wondering on this uh optional

02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479
wondering on this uh optional

02:31:52.479 --> 02:31:55.990
wondering on this uh optional uh fix name provider decorator. So I it

02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000
uh fix name provider decorator. So I it

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.389
uh fix name provider decorator. So I it need be to change

02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399
need be to change

02:31:58.399 --> 02:32:00.309
need be to change uh

02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319
uh

02:32:00.319 --> 02:32:02.550
uh yeah that's just playing around with the

02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560
yeah that's just playing around with the

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:06.790
yeah that's just playing around with the PHP. Okay. So that's just yesterday we

02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800
PHP. Okay. So that's just yesterday we

02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:09.270
PHP. Okay. So that's just yesterday we created a decorator that has hardcoded

02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:09.280
created a decorator that has hardcoded

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.830
created a decorator that has hardcoded that we always render username as first

02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840
that we always render username as first

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:14.630
that we always render username as first name, last name and something and here

02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640
name, last name and something and here

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:17.590
name, last name and something and here we actually we want to to render it

02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600
we actually we want to to render it

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:20.070
we actually we want to to render it based on the selected usernaming type.

02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080
based on the selected usernaming type.

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:23.030
based on the selected usernaming type. Okay. So for example I can show you at

02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040
Okay. So for example I can show you at

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:25.830
Okay. So for example I can show you at the end what does it do but believe me

02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840
the end what does it do but believe me

02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:27.590
the end what does it do but believe me that's just only playing around with

02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600
that's just only playing around with

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:30.309
that's just only playing around with PHP. So you don't need to do it you know

02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319
PHP. So you don't need to do it you know

02:32:30.319 --> 02:32:34.150
PHP. So you don't need to do it you know PHP very good. So from my point of view,

02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160
PHP very good. So from my point of view,

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:36.389
PHP very good. So from my point of view, you don't need to do the optional part.

02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399
you don't need to do the optional part.

02:32:36.399 --> 02:32:38.230
you don't need to do the optional part. Uh I'm showing you my screen. Can you

02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240
Uh I'm showing you my screen. Can you

02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:39.270
Uh I'm showing you my screen. Can you see it?

02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280
see it?

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:40.389
see it? I can.

02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399
I can.

02:32:40.399 --> 02:32:43.750
I can. Okay. Uh so at the end, what we just

02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760
Okay. Uh so at the end, what we just

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.990
Okay. Uh so at the end, what we just want to do is that whenever we select

02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000
want to do is that whenever we select

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.870
want to do is that whenever we select where is my user? Whenever we select a

02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880
where is my user? Whenever we select a

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:53.750
where is my user? Whenever we select a user naming type for user because the

02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760
user naming type for user because the

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.190
user naming type for user because the second part one of the part of the not

02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200
second part one of the part of the not

02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:00.070
second part one of the part of the not optional was to create relation between

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080
optional was to create relation between

02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:02.950
optional was to create relation between user and our usernaming type and then

02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960
user and our usernaming type and then

02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:05.750
user and our usernaming type and then fill the usernaming types with those

02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760
fill the usernaming types with those

02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.070
fill the usernaming types with those values. Right? So we will have three

02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080
values. Right? So we will have three

02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:09.910
values. Right? So we will have three using naming types with those values.

02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920
using naming types with those values.

02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:11.910
using naming types with those values. And we just basically want to

02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920
And we just basically want to

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:15.750
And we just basically want to if I select unofficial for my user then

02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760
if I select unofficial for my user then

02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:18.550
if I select unofficial for my user then name should be replaced with

02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560
name should be replaced with

02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:19.990
name should be replaced with first name last with last name middle

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000
first name last with last name middle

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.070
first name last with last name middle with middle blah blah blah. So basically

02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080
with middle blah blah blah. So basically

02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:24.870
with middle blah blah blah. So basically playing around with PHP seriously you

02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880
playing around with PHP seriously you

02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:26.070
playing around with PHP seriously you can try to do it but

02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080
can try to do it but

02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:29.030
can try to do it but so you're saying that in the decorator I

02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040
so you're saying that in the decorator I

02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:32.870
so you're saying that in the decorator I will have my uh field in place and I can

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880
will have my uh field in place and I can

02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:36.070
will have my uh field in place and I can get the current value set to the

02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080
get the current value set to the

02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:39.670
get the current value set to the the entity you have entity there entity

02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680
the entity you have entity there entity

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:41.190
the entity you have entity there entity is our user

02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200
is our user

02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:44.070
is our user we just created relation

02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080
we just created relation

02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.550
we just created relation uh to the naming type. So now on our

02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560
uh to the naming type. So now on our

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:50.070
uh to the naming type. So now on our user naming type uh sorry now on our

02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080
user naming type uh sorry now on our

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:53.590
user naming type uh sorry now on our user entity we have a naming type field.

02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600
user entity we have a naming type field.

02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.950
user entity we have a naming type field. So uh will in the background we have get

02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960
So uh will in the background we have get

02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:59.349
So uh will in the background we have get naming type set naming type everything

02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359
naming type set naming type everything

02:33:59.359 --> 02:34:02.309
naming type set naming type everything right? So we just added um a field

02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319
right? So we just added um a field

02:34:02.319 --> 02:34:04.950
right? So we just added um a field called naming type to the user entity.

02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960
called naming type to the user entity.

02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:08.710
called naming type to the user entity. So, right now in our decorator

02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720
So, right now in our decorator

02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.230
So, right now in our decorator and that's not the best.

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240
and that's not the best.

02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:18.309
and that's not the best. Uh, that's not the best.

02:34:18.319 --> 02:34:20.230
Okay,

02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240
Okay,

02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:32.870
Okay, just give me a second.

02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:35.750
Okay.

02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760
Okay.

02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:39.349
Okay. Uh inside the decorator

02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359
Uh inside the decorator

02:34:39.359 --> 02:34:42.469
Uh inside the decorator here in this method you have an entity

02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479
here in this method you have an entity

02:34:42.479 --> 02:34:45.110
here in this method you have an entity and this entity when I go to user view

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120
and this entity when I go to user view

02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:48.150
and this entity when I go to user view page is going to be a user. So we just

02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160
page is going to be a user. So we just

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.030
page is going to be a user. So we just created with the migration the naming

02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040
created with the migration the naming

02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.429
created with the migration the naming type field on user entity. So we have

02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439
type field on user entity. So we have

02:34:53.439 --> 02:34:56.630
type field on user entity. So we have get naming type etc. So, if I now go and

02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640
get naming type etc. So, if I now go and

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.990
get naming type etc. So, if I now go and select uh

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000
select uh

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.910
select uh Oh my gosh,

02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920
Oh my gosh,

02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:04.070
Oh my gosh, I'm lost.

02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080
I'm lost.

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:07.670
I'm lost. Uh for my user, if I go now here and

02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680
Uh for my user, if I go now here and

02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:12.150
Uh for my user, if I go now here and select some naming type, okay,

02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160
select some naming type, okay,

02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.710
select some naming type, okay, like unofficial, it will be set on the

02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720
like unofficial, it will be set on the

02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:17.429
like unofficial, it will be set on the user, right? So here now I can do entity

02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439
user, right? So here now I can do entity

02:35:17.439 --> 02:35:19.830
user, right? So here now I can do entity get naming type and it will return me

02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840
get naming type and it will return me

02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:22.309
get naming type and it will return me the fact that I selected unofficial. And

02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319
the fact that I selected unofficial. And

02:35:22.319 --> 02:35:24.710
the fact that I selected unofficial. And now this naming type uh this is our

02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720
now this naming type uh this is our

02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:27.110
now this naming type uh this is our custom entity. It has title and format

02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120
custom entity. It has title and format

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.150
custom entity. It has title and format and format is exactly

02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160
and format is exactly

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:33.030
and format is exactly right right. So and based on this you

02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040
right right. So and based on this you

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:35.270
right right. So and based on this you can replace it with real values.

02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280
can replace it with real values.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:38.150
can replace it with real values. Right. And this is the part was this get

02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160
Right. And this is the part was this get

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:40.550
Right. And this is the part was this get naming type is the part what was created

02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560
naming type is the part what was created

02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:43.110
naming type is the part what was created with this owner C.

02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120
with this owner C.

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:43.990
with this owner C. Right.

02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000
Right.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.630
Right. Yeah. And with the fact actually that uh

02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640
Yeah. And with the fact actually that uh

02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:48.950
Yeah. And with the fact actually that uh this entity is extendable and we have

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960
this entity is extendable and we have

02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:51.270
this entity is extendable and we have this extendable trait there which has

02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:51.280
this extendable trait there which has

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.670
this extendable trait there which has all those magic methods get set and set

02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680
all those magic methods get set and set

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:57.349
all those magic methods get set and set etc. So you can just do this get pass

02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359
etc. So you can just do this get pass

02:35:57.359 --> 02:35:58.950
etc. So you can just do this get pass the

02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960
the

02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:00.870
the uh name of the variable and it will

02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880
uh name of the variable and it will

02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:06.309
uh name of the variable and it will return you appropriate value

02:36:06.319 --> 02:36:10.309
then yeah I can say that I I'm close at

02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319
then yeah I can say that I I'm close at

02:36:10.319 --> 02:36:13.110
then yeah I can say that I I'm close at least to finish with this

02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120
least to finish with this

02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:15.030
least to finish with this this part with the filling of the types

02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040
this part with the filling of the types

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:17.750
this part with the filling of the types and then check it.

02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:17.760
and then check it.

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.110
and then check it. Okay.

02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120
Okay.

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:23.990
Okay. Um I have a qu a separate question.

02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000
Um I have a qu a separate question.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.670
Um I have a qu a separate question. So in the data fixture it does call the

02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680
So in the data fixture it does call the

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.990
So in the data fixture it does call the manager close. I know in previous

02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000
manager close. I know in previous

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.469
manager close. I know in previous dealings with Symphony once you close

02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479
dealings with Symphony once you close

02:36:32.479 --> 02:36:34.950
dealings with Symphony once you close the entity manager it sort of like is

02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960
the entity manager it sort of like is

02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:37.030
the entity manager it sort of like is inaccessible to anybody else and getting

02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040
inaccessible to anybody else and getting

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.349
inaccessible to anybody else and getting it to reopen is

02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359
it to reopen is

02:36:39.359 --> 02:36:42.230
it to reopen is from my experience pretty difficult. Um

02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240
from my experience pretty difficult. Um

02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:44.870
from my experience pretty difficult. Um should we avoid Oh says clear. Never

02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880
should we avoid Oh says clear. Never

02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:46.070
should we avoid Oh says clear. Never mind. I thought it said close.

02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080
mind. I thought it said close.

02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.070
mind. I thought it said close. I never do the clear in the fixtures.

02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080
I never do the clear in the fixtures.

02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:50.389
I never do the clear in the fixtures. That was just in the example but you

02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399
That was just in the example but you

02:36:50.399 --> 02:36:52.630
That was just in the example but you just need to do flash to push the

02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640
just need to do flash to push the

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:54.950
just need to do flash to push the changes to database right to flush the

02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960
changes to database right to flush the

02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:55.990
changes to database right to flush the database

02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000
database

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.550
database and then the clear is not needed there.

02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560
and then the clear is not needed there.

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:01.110
and then the clear is not needed there. Basically uh you execute migrations in a

02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120
Basically uh you execute migrations in a

02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.030
Basically uh you execute migrations in a command from CLI. So the fact that you

02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040
command from CLI. So the fact that you

02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:05.270
command from CLI. So the fact that you closed it will not make any difference

02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280
closed it will not make any difference

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:08.950
closed it will not make any difference because in every new time that you will

02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960
because in every new time that you will

02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:11.030
because in every new time that you will rerun this command it will be opened

02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040
rerun this command it will be opened

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.349
rerun this command it will be opened again. So it will not do any harm there

02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359
again. So it will not do any harm there

02:37:13.359 --> 02:37:15.750
again. So it will not do any harm there actually. Well, if you had a second one,

02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760
actually. Well, if you had a second one,

02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:16.790
actually. Well, if you had a second one, I keep doing clear.

02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800
I keep doing clear.

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:17.750
I keep doing clear. Yeah, you should close.

02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760
Yeah, you should close.

02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.110
Yeah, you should close. Please keep doing clear.

02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120
Please keep doing clear.

02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:21.270
Please keep doing clear. Okay. My only thought with the clear

02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.280
Okay. My only thought with the clear

02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.030
Okay. My only thought with the clear would be is if you loaded data from some

02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040
would be is if you loaded data from some

02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:27.349
would be is if you loaded data from some other entities to update your entities,

02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359
other entities to update your entities,

02:37:27.359 --> 02:37:28.870
other entities to update your entities, you may want to clear that out so that

02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880
you may want to clear that out so that

02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:30.630
you may want to clear that out so that they're not attached

02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640
they're not attached

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:34.150
they're not attached for further processing. Um, but that

02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160
for further processing. Um, but that

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:36.150
for further processing. Um, but that would be the reason why they probably do

02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160
would be the reason why they probably do

02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:37.590
would be the reason why they probably do that.

02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600
that.

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.510
that. Yeah. So this probably is because this

02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520
Yeah. So this probably is because this

02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.030
Yeah. So this probably is because this example was uh loaded like together with

02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040
example was uh loaded like together with

02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:46.950
example was uh loaded like together with a lot of different uh data fixtures. So

02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960
a lot of different uh data fixtures. So

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:49.110
a lot of different uh data fixtures. So maybe this clear was just needed some at

02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120
maybe this clear was just needed some at

02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:51.670
maybe this clear was just needed some at some point. But to be honest uh I would

02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680
some point. But to be honest uh I would

02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:53.429
some point. But to be honest uh I would need to check the code and figure out

02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439
need to check the code and figure out

02:37:53.439 --> 02:37:56.469
need to check the code and figure out why this clear is actually there.

02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479
why this clear is actually there.

02:37:56.479 --> 02:38:04.550
why this clear is actually there. Okay.

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:09.110
Uh okay. So tomorrow we'll start from

02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120
Uh okay. So tomorrow we'll start from

02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:11.190
Uh okay. So tomorrow we'll start from actually me asking you if we can go

02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200
actually me asking you if we can go

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:12.870
actually me asking you if we can go further or you need some more

02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880
further or you need some more

02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:15.510
further or you need some more clarification for this. If you still

02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520
clarification for this. If you still

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:18.070
clarification for this. If you still have a time to finish this nonoptional

02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080
have a time to finish this nonoptional

02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:20.710
have a time to finish this nonoptional part uh please do

02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720
part uh please do

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.870
part uh please do uh because tomorrow we'll just do

02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880
uh because tomorrow we'll just do

02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:27.030
uh because tomorrow we'll just do another practice for another topic. So

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040
another practice for another topic. So

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.750
another practice for another topic. So uh yep I need to ask you to just try to

02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760
uh yep I need to ask you to just try to

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:38.389
uh yep I need to ask you to just try to figure it out and have it for tomorrow.

02:38:38.399 --> 02:38:45.429
Yep. Do you have any other questions?

02:38:45.439 --> 02:38:47.670
