00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.790
Very good.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:02.800
Very good.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.590
Very good. It's been a nice one. Finally not

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600
It's been a nice one. Finally not

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.230
It's been a nice one. Finally not raining.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240
raining.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.790
raining. Sounds great.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.350
Okay, let's wait for others. Uh let's

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
Okay, let's wait for others. Uh let's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.670
Okay, let's wait for others. Uh let's give them a few more minutes and we'll

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680
give them a few more minutes and we'll

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.269
give them a few more minutes and we'll start

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279
start

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.109
start and we'll start from practice. So

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119
and we'll start from practice. So

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.950
and we'll start from practice. So I think we'll wait for Vladimir.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960
I think we'll wait for Vladimir.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.910
I think we'll wait for Vladimir. So today we should start with ACL

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920
So today we should start with ACL

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.029
So today we should start with ACL practice.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039
practice.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.590
practice. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.069
Okay. Actually,

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079
Okay. Actually,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.869
Okay. Actually, hi Vladimir. So actually we can start

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879
hi Vladimir. So actually we can start

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.430
hi Vladimir. So actually we can start because you're only you are doing the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
because you're only you are doing the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
because you're only you are doing the practice parts. So if someone for from

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680
practice parts. So if someone for from

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.069
practice parts. So if someone for from Falcrum will join in the meantime then

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079
Falcrum will join in the meantime then

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.950
Falcrum will join in the meantime then Yep. But basically I was waiting for you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960
Yep. But basically I was waiting for you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.229
Yep. But basically I was waiting for you to start. Hi Vladimir. How are you?

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239

Good. Good. Thank you. Okay. Uh okay, guys. Do you have any

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800
Okay. Uh okay, guys. Do you have any

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.109
Okay. Uh okay, guys. Do you have any questions to the last part to the last

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119
questions to the last part to the last

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.950
questions to the last part to the last week? Uh last practice or any of the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960
week? Uh last practice or any of the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.670
week? Uh last practice or any of the topics from last week.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.190
Okay.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.469
Questions from my side at the moment?

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479
Questions from my side at the moment?

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.950
Questions from my side at the moment? No, the only thing I want to mention is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
No, the only thing I want to mention is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.070
No, the only thing I want to mention is I found sort of a way to deal with that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
I found sort of a way to deal with that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.990
I found sort of a way to deal with that uh entity naming problem.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000
uh entity naming problem.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.990
uh entity naming problem. So like in the search, remember it was

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000
So like in the search, remember it was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.590
So like in the search, remember it was showing like the format and stuff. So

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
showing like the format and stuff. So

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.910
showing like the format and stuff. So there's a what was it called?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920
there's a what was it called?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.149
there's a what was it called? There's like a bunch of name entity name

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159
There's like a bunch of name entity name

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.270
There's like a bunch of name entity name like providers and there was one that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
like providers and there was one that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.190
like providers and there was one that based it off of configuration. So I was

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200
based it off of configuration. So I was

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.469
based it off of configuration. So I was able to just make app.yaml YML and then

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479
able to just make app.yaml YML and then

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.069
able to just make app.yaml YML and then I was able to just put a bit of config

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
I was able to just put a bit of config

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.950
I was able to just put a bit of config in there that said essentially

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
in there that said essentially

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.429
in there that said essentially um I can probably paste it in real

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439
um I can probably paste it in real

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.709
um I can probably paste it in real quick. I don't know if it's going to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719
quick. I don't know if it's going to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.030
quick. I don't know if it's going to come through in the chat very well but

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.789
but essentially it was this entity name

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
but essentially it was this entity name

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.109
but essentially it was this entity name representation key and then you give it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119
representation key and then you give it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.990
representation key and then you give it then the class is like the you know so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
then the class is like the you know so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.750
then the class is like the you know so this is my entity class and then you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
this is my entity class and then you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.030
this is my entity class and then you kind of tell it what you want for full

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
kind of tell it what you want for full

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.550
kind of tell it what you want for full and short file right

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
and short file right

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.869
and short file right or

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879
or

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.270
or it was app.yaml YAML.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
it was app.yaml YAML.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.990
it was app.yaml YAML. Okay.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
Okay.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.229
Okay. Yeah, that's what I I went through and

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239
Yeah, that's what I I went through and

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.670
Yeah, that's what I I went through and looked at like some of the core stuff

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
looked at like some of the core stuff

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.190
looked at like some of the core stuff and that's where it was putting it in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
and that's where it was putting it in

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.510
and that's where it was putting it in all of the like the core modules. It

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
all of the like the core modules. It

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.990
all of the like the core modules. It could probably be in any YAML file or

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
could probably be in any YAML file or

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.070
could probably be in any YAML file or that was the one that that one's in Oro.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
that was the one that that one's in Oro.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.150
that was the one that that one's in Oro. So,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
So,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.869
So, basically uh things regarding the

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879
basically uh things regarding the

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.110
basically uh things regarding the entities, we usually have an entity

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
entities, we usually have an entity

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.830
entities, we usually have an entity file, but you know, if that's uh

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840
file, but you know, if that's uh

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.790
file, but you know, if that's uh uh that's for entity name providers. So

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
uh that's for entity name providers. So

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.270
uh that's for entity name providers. So probably for the name provider uh the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280
probably for the name provider uh the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.589
probably for the name provider uh the bundle that this functionality sits it

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
bundle that this functionality sits it

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.430
bundle that this functionality sits it can be also that's why I asked if it's

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
can be also that's why I asked if it's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.830
can be also that's why I asked if it's in a because this is basically the place

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
in a because this is basically the place

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.509
in a because this is basically the place for all the configuration for all the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519
for all the configuration for all the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.070
for all the configuration for all the bundles but uh for some particular

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080
bundles but uh for some particular

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.750
bundles but uh for some particular elements like for example if you'd like

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760
elements like for example if you'd like

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.790
elements like for example if you'd like to change the aliases then you do it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800
to change the aliases then you do it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.190
to change the aliases then you do it from entity.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
from entity.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.030
from entity. Okay I could probably put this in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
Okay I could probably put this in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.270
Okay I could probably put this in entity.yaml though I presume and it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
entity.yaml though I presume and it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.750
entity.yaml though I presume and it would still work or are the Oro config

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
would still work or are the Oro config

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.670
would still work or are the Oro config files more specific?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
files more specific?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.790
files more specific? I'm not sure.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
I'm not sure.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.910
I'm not sure. Okay.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.270
I was looking to see if any of the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
I was looking to see if any of the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.910
I was looking to see if any of the modules do that.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
modules do that.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.070
modules do that. I go with the listener to be honest or

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080
I go with the listener to be honest or

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.630
I go with the listener to be honest or the creator. But that's good.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
the creator. But that's good.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.949
the creator. But that's good. Yeah. This seemed to be how all the like

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
Yeah. This seemed to be how all the like

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.070
Yeah. This seemed to be how all the like core entities were being done. So like I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080
core entities were being done. So like I

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.030
core entities were being done. So like I looked at contacts, users, marketing,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
looked at contacts, users, marketing,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.869
looked at contacts, users, marketing, like everything is basically using this

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879
like everything is basically using this

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.830
like everything is basically using this process to define what the label should

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
process to define what the label should

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.550
process to define what the label should be or you know how to label the entity

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560
be or you know how to label the entity

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.149
be or you know how to label the entity effectively.

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159
effectively.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.430
effectively. Yeah. Great. Awesome that you found it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
Yeah. Great. Awesome that you found it

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.630
Yeah. Great. Awesome that you found it and yeah. Cool.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640
and yeah. Cool.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.229
and yeah. Cool. That's really really good.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.750
Okay guys, so uh we will start from the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
Okay guys, so uh we will start from the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.550
Okay guys, so uh we will start from the practice for the ACL. So I know it was

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560
practice for the ACL. So I know it was

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.589
practice for the ACL. So I know it was on Friday. Uh so I'll just quickly go

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599
on Friday. Uh so I'll just quickly go

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.990
on Friday. Uh so I'll just quickly go through the elements that we're supposed

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
through the elements that we're supposed

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.550
through the elements that we're supposed to do during the practice

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
to do during the practice

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.589
to do during the practice um and give you some recap. So first

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599
um and give you some recap. So first

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.390
um and give you some recap. So first element is to add security section to

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
element is to add security section to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.670
element is to add security section to our entity. We are not going to do

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
our entity. We are not going to do

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.590
our entity. We are not going to do ownership. So we're going to have only

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
ownership. So we're going to have only

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.909
ownership. So we're going to have only two levels none and global. But we need

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919
two levels none and global. But we need

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.310
two levels none and global. But we need to add the security section after we do

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320
to add the security section after we do

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.110
to add the security section after we do this. Uh and go to any back office role.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120
this. Uh and go to any back office role.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.790
this. Uh and go to any back office role. I will add it my administrator.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
I will add it my administrator.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.909
I will add it my administrator. uh you should see

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919
uh you should see

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.189
uh you should see this entity here because right now you

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199
this entity here because right now you

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.749
this entity here because right now you don't have it here. So because the ACL

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759
don't have it here. So because the ACL

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.909
don't have it here. So because the ACL is disabled for our entity and we need

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919
is disabled for our entity and we need

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.670
is disabled for our entity and we need to enable it. So how to enable it?

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680
to enable it. So how to enable it?

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.150
to enable it. So how to enable it? uh you need to add security section and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160
uh you need to add security section and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:03.110
uh you need to add security section and it was uh basically on the slide

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.070
and this first part is in our theory

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080
and this first part is in our theory

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.469
and this first part is in our theory slides here is the slide number six how

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479
slides here is the slide number six how

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.350
slides here is the slide number six how to enable entity per permissions. So you

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360
to enable entity per permissions. So you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.430
to enable entity per permissions. So you need to put this part actually you have

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440
need to put this part actually you have

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.510
need to put this part actually you have it in the example

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520
it in the example

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.189
it in the example and

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199
and

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.670
and type is ACL we only support one type

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680
type is ACL we only support one type

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.909
type is ACL we only support one type group name this means back office and

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919
group name this means back office and

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.070
group name this means back office and basically actually we're going to do it

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080
basically actually we're going to do it

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.310
basically actually we're going to do it for usernaming type so this also seems

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320
for usernaming type so this also seems

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.350
for usernaming type so this also seems like a good category uh because um

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360
like a good category uh because um

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.430
like a good category uh because um account management we have here users

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440
account management we have here users

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.510
account management we have here users so it seems like also a good place for

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520
so it seems like also a good place for

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.749
so it seems like also a good place for user naming types. So basically you can

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759
user naming types. So basically you can

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.790
user naming types. So basically you can do exactly what is in this example and

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800
do exactly what is in this example and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.029
do exactly what is in this example and it's inside default values do not forget

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039
it's inside default values do not forget

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.790
it's inside default values do not forget about this part and because we are

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800
about this part and because we are

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.270
about this part and because we are editing at config section then uh also

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280
editing at config section then uh also

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.629
editing at config section then uh also execute this command. Okay so after you

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639
execute this command. Okay so after you

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.629
execute this command. Okay so after you add this part to the usernaming type

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639
add this part to the usernaming type

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.029
add this part to the usernaming type entity and execute this command you

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039
entity and execute this command you

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.870
entity and execute this command you should be able to see um this entity

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880
should be able to see um this entity

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.430
should be able to see um this entity here on the list.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440
here on the list.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.790
here on the list. Okay. Uh and because you have it here

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800
Okay. Uh and because you have it here

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.189
Okay. Uh and because you have it here and with no ownership we have only two

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199
and with no ownership we have only two

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.590
and with no ownership we have only two levels. Uh now you can for example

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600
levels. Uh now you can for example

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.550
levels. Uh now you can for example restrict administrator from viewing uh

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560
restrict administrator from viewing uh

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.670
restrict administrator from viewing uh usernaming types and the second task is

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680
usernaming types and the second task is

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.430
usernaming types and the second task is to basically use it. So

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440
to basically use it. So

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.990
to basically use it. So we need to create this rule to view

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000
we need to create this rule to view

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.629
we need to create this rule to view usernaming type and apply it in

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639
usernaming type and apply it in

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.510
usernaming type and apply it in controller. So we will I want you to

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520
controller. So we will I want you to

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.309
controller. So we will I want you to protect index and view action. We'll

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319
protect index and view action. We'll

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.230
protect index and view action. We'll start from view

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240
start from view

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.510
start from view um with this rule and how to do it. You

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
um with this rule and how to do it. You

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.110
um with this rule and how to do it. You have also on the slides

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120
have also on the slides

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.830
have also on the slides how to define anti permissions rules and

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840
how to define anti permissions rules and

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.749
how to define anti permissions rules and example in the controller. So in our

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759
example in the controller. So in our

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.070
example in the controller. So in our controller for user naming types above

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080
controller for user naming types above

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.070
controller for user naming types above the view action you need to create this

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080
the view action you need to create this

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.309
the view action you need to create this rule. Give it some ID. Remember that

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319
rule. Give it some ID. Remember that

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.309
rule. Give it some ID. Remember that this name later will be used for example

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319
this name later will be used for example

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.710
this name later will be used for example in data grid. So it's good if this name

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720
in data grid. So it's good if this name

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.589
in data grid. So it's good if this name tells you something. Then type is entity

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599
tells you something. Then type is entity

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.790
tells you something. Then type is entity class will be for us training usernaming

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800
class will be for us training usernaming

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.909
class will be for us training usernaming type bundle or whatever your bundle name

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919
type bundle or whatever your bundle name

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.110
type bundle or whatever your bundle name is and then colon and name of the

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120
is and then colon and name of the

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.110
is and then colon and name of the entity. So it needs to be this

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120
entity. So it needs to be this

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.070
entity. So it needs to be this particular format. Why? Because our ACL

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080
particular format. Why? Because our ACL

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.790
particular format. Why? Because our ACL bundle basically requires it like this

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800
bundle basically requires it like this

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.710
bundle basically requires it like this because then we have a parser and so on.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720
because then we have a parser and so on.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.589
because then we have a parser and so on. So basically you need to have name space

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599
So basically you need to have name space

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:27.110
So basically you need to have name space name of the bundle with the bundle

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120
name of the bundle with the bundle

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.589
name of the bundle with the bundle keyword colon and name of your entity

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599
keyword colon and name of your entity

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.390
keyword colon and name of your entity and for the view permission. Okay. So

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400
and for the view permission. Okay. So

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.029
and for the view permission. Okay. So now with this annotation you're actually

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039
now with this annotation you're actually

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.390
now with this annotation you're actually creating this rule and also using it on

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400
creating this rule and also using it on

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.670
creating this rule and also using it on top of view action. So now after you add

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680
top of view action. So now after you add

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.309
top of view action. So now after you add this part you don't need to refresh

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319
this part you don't need to refresh

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.390
this part you don't need to refresh anything. You don't need to do anything

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400
anything. You don't need to do anything

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.350
anything. You don't need to do anything else. Uh you can actually already play

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360
else. Uh you can actually already play

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.150
else. Uh you can actually already play around with it. So if you're logged in

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160
around with it. So if you're logged in

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.150
around with it. So if you're logged in as administrator, just come here,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160
as administrator, just come here,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.390
as administrator, just come here, restrict access to none. Save it of

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400
restrict access to none. Save it of

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.629
restrict access to none. Save it of course and then go to the view page and

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639
course and then go to the view page and

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.830
course and then go to the view page and you should see 403 forbidden. Okay. So

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840
you should see 403 forbidden. Okay. So

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.230
you should see 403 forbidden. Okay. So this is uh yeah. So also then later

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240
this is uh yeah. So also then later

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.350
this is uh yeah. So also then later protect data grid and basically play

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360
protect data grid and basically play

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.670
protect data grid and basically play around with it, right? So remember that

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680
around with it, right? So remember that

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.150
around with it, right? So remember that if you protect index then you will not

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160
if you protect index then you will not

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.430
if you protect index then you will not see anything. So maybe unprotect index

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440
see anything. So maybe unprotect index

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.029
see anything. So maybe unprotect index and protect only data grid check uh that

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039
and protect only data grid check uh that

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:23.350
and protect only data grid check uh that the fact that data grid will just be

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360
the fact that data grid will just be

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.070
the fact that data grid will just be gone. Okay.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080
gone. Okay.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.909
gone. Okay. And that's basically all regarding um

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919
And that's basically all regarding um

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:34.469
And that's basically all regarding um the nonoptional parts and the optional

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479
the nonoptional parts and the optional

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:39.589
the nonoptional parts and the optional the first optional part is uh to

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599
the first optional part is uh to

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.110
the first optional part is uh to I'm not sure if you have this because

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120
I'm not sure if you have this because

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.750
I'm not sure if you have this because this is related to optional part from

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760
this is related to optional part from

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.949
this is related to optional part from previous uh elements we had we created

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959
previous uh elements we had we created

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:54.070
previous uh elements we had we created on our usernaming type view page

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080
on our usernaming type view page

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.269
on our usernaming type view page we have a list of users users that has

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279
we have a list of users users that has

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.590
we have a list of users users that has that have this uh usernaming type

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600
that have this uh usernaming type

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.910
that have this uh usernaming type assigned and we're supposed to protect

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920
assigned and we're supposed to protect

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.430
assigned and we're supposed to protect this

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440
this

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.509
this data grid uh with

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.910
permission if I have view permission for

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920
permission if I have view permission for

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.710
permission if I have view permission for user entity. So the only thing uh that I

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720
user entity. So the only thing uh that I

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.949
user entity. So the only thing uh that I will now tell you is uh like for the

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959
will now tell you is uh like for the

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:19.590
will now tell you is uh like for the future if you'd like to search for this

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600
future if you'd like to search for this

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.509
future if you'd like to search for this rule because this rule probably exists

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519
rule because this rule probably exists

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.750
rule because this rule probably exists already. the user is a core entity and

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760
already. the user is a core entity and

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.509
already. the user is a core entity and we want to check if I have view

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519
we want to check if I have view

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:28.790
we want to check if I have view permission to this user entity. Uh so as

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800
permission to this user entity. Uh so as

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.870
permission to this user entity. Uh so as I told you we always protect all the

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880
I told you we always protect all the

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.269
I told you we always protect all the controllers with ACL. So you can be 200%

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279
controllers with ACL. So you can be 200%

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:39.350
controllers with ACL. So you can be 200% sure that uh index action for the user

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360
sure that uh index action for the user

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.110
sure that uh index action for the user and view action for the user are

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120
and view action for the user are

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.350
and view action for the user are protected with this rule. So if you want

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360
protected with this rule. So if you want

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.710
protected with this rule. So if you want to use it, you need to find this ID.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720
to use it, you need to find this ID.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.030
to use it, you need to find this ID. Okay, this is actually exactly this one

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040
Okay, this is actually exactly this one

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.590
Okay, this is actually exactly this one because we are in user controller and

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600
because we are in user controller and

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.350
because we are in user controller and this is view action and as you can see

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360
this is view action and as you can see

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.710
this is view action and as you can see our view action is protected with ACL

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720
our view action is protected with ACL

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.790
our view action is protected with ACL and this is view permission for user

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800
and this is view permission for user

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.990
and this is view permission for user entity. So this is exactly how you would

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000
entity. So this is exactly how you would

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.910
entity. So this is exactly how you would find the

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920
find the

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.949
find the ID of ACL. Just go to controller and

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959
ID of ACL. Just go to controller and

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:14.630
ID of ACL. Just go to controller and check this one. And with this

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640
check this one. And with this

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.030
check this one. And with this you need to protect this data grid. And

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040
you need to protect this data grid. And

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.470
you need to protect this data grid. And to protect data grids you can also come

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480
to protect data grids you can also come

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.350
to protect data grids you can also come back here. So this is only basically

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360
back here. So this is only basically

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.829
back here. So this is only basically using the ID of our rule and there is a

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839
using the ID of our rule and there is a

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:29.990
using the ID of our rule and there is a field ACL resource that you need to fill

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000
field ACL resource that you need to fill

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.710
field ACL resource that you need to fill it. So this is playing around around

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720
it. So this is playing around around

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.150
it. So this is playing around around with how to use ACL rules in the YAML

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160
with how to use ACL rules in the YAML

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.590
with how to use ACL rules in the YAML file. Okay. And the last one is actually

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600
file. Okay. And the last one is actually

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.949
file. Okay. And the last one is actually not uh is about creating ACL capability.

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959
not uh is about creating ACL capability.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:48.310
not uh is about creating ACL capability. So you remember that we have

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.310
entity based permissions and then we

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320
entity based permissions and then we

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.310
entity based permissions and then we also have capabilities like this. So

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320
also have capabilities like this. So

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.870
also have capabilities like this. So this is only yes no value. So the last

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880
this is only yes no value. So the last

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.990
this is only yes no value. So the last optional part is to create that kind of

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000
optional part is to create that kind of

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.710
optional part is to create that kind of um ACL and for this you need to do it

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720
um ACL and for this you need to do it

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.110
um ACL and for this you need to do it inside uh this is the second

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120
inside uh this is the second

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.990
inside uh this is the second let's skip to actions

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000
let's skip to actions

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.069
let's skip to actions how to define action permissions so

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079
how to define action permissions so

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.750
how to define action permissions so capabilities

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760
capabilities

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.509
capabilities uh so inside ACL file you can also

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519
uh so inside ACL file you can also

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:21.269
uh so inside ACL file you can also create a rule so you need to give it

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279
create a rule so you need to give it

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.110
create a rule so you need to give it identifier

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120
identifier

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.870
identifier some label

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880
some label

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.870
some label because it needs to be displayed here by

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880
because it needs to be displayed here by

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.150
because it needs to be displayed here by this label

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.829
uh type this is action this goes to back

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839
uh type this is action this goes to back

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.910
uh type this is action this goes to back office category again this is just for

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920
office category again this is just for

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.470
office category again this is just for the UI to display it in in appropriate

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480
the UI to display it in in appropriate

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.389
the UI to display it in in appropriate tab uh and that's it after you create it

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399
tab uh and that's it after you create it

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:45.430
tab uh and that's it after you create it you can use it by the identifier so the

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440
you can use it by the identifier so the

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.470
you can use it by the identifier so the last task which is also optional is just

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480
last task which is also optional is just

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.310
last task which is also optional is just to play around with the fact that um you

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320
to play around with the fact that um you

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.870
to play around with the fact that um you can create it also from ACL file. Yes,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880
can create it also from ACL file. Yes,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.190
can create it also from ACL file. Yes, for the last part you're just describing

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200
for the last part you're just describing

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.829
for the last part you're just describing how the uh this capability is joined to

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839
how the uh this capability is joined to

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.470
how the uh this capability is joined to the entity on the admin panel.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480
the entity on the admin panel.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.509
the entity on the admin panel. It's not that's some separate uh

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519
It's not that's some separate uh

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.150
It's not that's some separate uh capability that you can create and it

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160
capability that you can create and it

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.750
capability that you can create and it will be here uh

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760
will be here uh

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.389
will be here uh it's like showing on the workflow. Okay,

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399
it's like showing on the workflow. Okay,

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:21.350
it's like showing on the workflow. Okay, it's after the grid showing.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360
it's after the grid showing.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.069
it's after the grid showing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here it's uh basically

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here it's uh basically

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:27.990
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here it's uh basically after the this part is divided in we

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000
after the this part is divided in we

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.710
after the this part is divided in we have entity and first we have list of

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720
have entity and first we have list of

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.790
have entity and first we have list of entities and if you scroll down you'll

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800
entities and if you scroll down you'll

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.750
entities and if you scroll down you'll have list of

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760
have list of

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.509
have list of um capabilities those

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519
um capabilities those

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:40.069
um capabilities those okay so it's splitted like this sections

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079
okay so it's splitted like this sections

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:43.430
okay so it's splitted like this sections like catalog account management

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440
like catalog account management

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.150
like catalog account management oh yeah too but if you just switch to

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160
oh yeah too but if you just switch to

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.310
oh yeah too but if you just switch to all then you'll have all entities first

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320
all then you'll have all entities first

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.030
all then you'll have all entities first and then all capabilities

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040
and then all capabilities

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.430
and then all capabilities okay

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440
okay

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.550
okay available

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560
available

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.750
available And this capability just yes is defined

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760
And this capability just yes is defined

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.629
And this capability just yes is defined by you. You give it a label and that's

00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639
by you. You give it a label and that's

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.710
by you. You give it a label and that's it. And then you use it by the

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720
it. And then you use it by the

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.829
it. And then you use it by the identifier. Okay. So you can protect it

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839
identifier. Okay. So you can protect it

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:08.550
identifier. Okay. So you can protect it anywhere just by using identifier. Um

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560
anywhere just by using identifier. Um

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.230
anywhere just by using identifier. Um and if you use PHP code then

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240
and if you use PHP code then

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.670
and if you use PHP code then this way. If in yam file then this way

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680
this way. If in yam file then this way

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.550
this way. If in yam file then this way and if in tweak template then with the

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560
and if in tweak template then with the

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.910
and if in tweak template then with the is granted uh tweak function. And I

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920
is granted uh tweak function. And I

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.550
is granted uh tweak function. And I think that here was a low showing of

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560
think that here was a low showing of

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.030
think that here was a low showing of name naming information at user view

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040
name naming information at user view

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.269
name naming information at user view page. So this is also connected to

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279
page. So this is also connected to

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:34.230
page. So this is also connected to optional part. So on the user view page,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240
optional part. So on the user view page,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.069
optional part. So on the user view page, let's me switch to user view page.

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079
let's me switch to user view page.

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.230
let's me switch to user view page. One of the optional elements actually

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240
One of the optional elements actually

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.590
One of the optional elements actually first practice was to add this part and

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600
first practice was to add this part and

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.509
first practice was to add this part and this was created with a listener. So

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519
this was created with a listener. So

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:47.910
this was created with a listener. So this is actually to play around at first

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920
this is actually to play around at first

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.509
this is actually to play around at first with a creation of rule inside the yam

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519
with a creation of rule inside the yam

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:54.310
with a creation of rule inside the yam file and not controller and then using

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320
file and not controller and then using

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.509
file and not controller and then using it with PHP code. So

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519
it with PHP code. So

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:59.829
it with PHP code. So this way

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839
this way

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.110
this way uh because this part is created via the

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120
uh because this part is created via the

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.230
uh because this part is created via the listener which is PHP class. So

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240
listener which is PHP class. So

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.949
listener which is PHP class. So just use it in PHP code.

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.949
Yep. And that's that's it. So I'm not

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959
Yep. And that's that's it. So I'm not

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:19.269
Yep. And that's that's it. So I'm not sure if you have those elements because

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279
sure if you have those elements because

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.269
sure if you have those elements because th those are optional connected to

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279
th those are optional connected to

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:24.310
th those are optional connected to optional parts from previous practices.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320
optional parts from previous practices.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.910
optional parts from previous practices. Uh so be just make sure that you do

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920
Uh so be just make sure that you do

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.470
Uh so be just make sure that you do those and then we're good to go because

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480
those and then we're good to go because

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.350
those and then we're good to go because it's basically everything you need to

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360
it's basically everything you need to

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.550
it's basically everything you need to know for ACL.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560
know for ACL.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.110
know for ACL. Okay. Uh and we have like about an hour

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120
Okay. Uh and we have like about an hour

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.230
Okay. Uh and we have like about an hour for this. I think it should be

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240
for this. I think it should be

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.350
for this. I think it should be enough to play around with it.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360
enough to play around with it.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.389
enough to play around with it. And during this time, I'm here. So guys,

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399
And during this time, I'm here. So guys,

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:53.430
And during this time, I'm here. So guys, unmute yourself and ask any questions.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.590
And I will stop sharing my screen. So

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600
And I will stop sharing my screen. So

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.990
And I will stop sharing my screen. So please open this from the email. You

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000
please open this from the email. You

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:10.310
please open this from the email. You have slides in the email.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:18.310
Yes.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.829
Did you raise head, Vladimir?

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839
Did you raise head, Vladimir?

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:26.069
Did you raise head, Vladimir? Yes. Yes. Um so, uh have a question

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079
Yes. Yes. Um so, uh have a question

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:29.189
Yes. Yes. Um so, uh have a question about resources.

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199
about resources.

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:33.189
about resources. uh uh as I've understood we

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199
uh uh as I've understood we

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.910
uh uh as I've understood we uh set up resources which can can be

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920
uh set up resources which can can be

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.590
uh set up resources which can can be reused on controller level

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600
reused on controller level

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.150
reused on controller level um

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160
um

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.629
um uh and also we can set up it on entity

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639
uh and also we can set up it on entity

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:49.269
uh and also we can set up it on entity level correct

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.189
okay you're talking about registering

00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199
okay you're talking about registering

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.590
okay you're talking about registering some particular rule for ACL right so

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600
some particular rule for ACL right so

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.870
some particular rule for ACL right so you can do it in controller as

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880
you can do it in controller as

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.110
you can do it in controller as annotation

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120
annotation

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.550
annotation and you can do it also in ACL clim file

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560
and you can do it also in ACL clim file

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.230
and you can do it also in ACL clim file or you're asking about something else.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240
or you're asking about something else.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.470
or you're asking about something else. Yeah. Uh can we I have a question. Can

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480
Yeah. Uh can we I have a question. Can

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.350
Yeah. Uh can we I have a question. Can we set up multiple rules um

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360
we set up multiple rules um

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.069
we set up multiple rules um on controller level as an annotation

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079
on controller level as an annotation

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:16.389
on controller level as an annotation or it's not

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399
or it's not

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:19.509
or it's not if you want to it's if you want to

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519
if you want to it's if you want to

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.990
if you want to it's if you want to register multiple rules at once and then

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000
register multiple rules at once and then

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.230
register multiple rules at once and then use them. So probably better will be to

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240
use them. So probably better will be to

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.509
use them. So probably better will be to put it in uh the ACLM file. uh but yes

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519
put it in uh the ACLM file. uh but yes

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.910
put it in uh the ACLM file. uh but yes you can uh create multiple annotations

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920
you can uh create multiple annotations

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.389
you can uh create multiple annotations on the control level for example you can

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399
on the control level for example you can

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.269
on the control level for example you can use uh you can protect this controller

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279
use uh you can protect this controller

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:38.310
use uh you can protect this controller action with two rules right if you need

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320
action with two rules right if you need

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.590
action with two rules right if you need it's not a common case but I can come up

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600
it's not a common case but I can come up

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.389
it's not a common case but I can come up with with such a

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399
with with such a

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:47.509
with with such a case

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.949
once again uh so this um resource which

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959
once again uh so this um resource which

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.430
once again uh so this um resource which I register on controller level it can be

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440
I register on controller level it can be

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.829
I register on controller level it can be also set up on

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839
also set up on

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:59.590
also set up on um incl.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600
um incl.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.590
um incl. Mhm. Exactly.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600
Mhm. Exactly.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.509
Mhm. Exactly. So you have two options actually. You

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519
So you have two options actually. You

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:06.069
So you have two options actually. You can do it in controller or ACL. It's up

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079
can do it in controller or ACL. It's up

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.429
can do it in controller or ACL. It's up to you where

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:13.429
I I see that it's more convenient for me

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439
I I see that it's more convenient for me

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.909
I I see that it's more convenient for me to to set up it on ACL

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919
to to set up it on ACL

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:22.470
to to set up it on ACL to be to see all ACL I said for the

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480
to be to see all ACL I said for the

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.270
to be to see all ACL I said for the so the reason we have the controller

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280
so the reason we have the controller

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.950
so the reason we have the controller it's because we usually protect uh with

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960
it's because we usually protect uh with

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.669
it's because we usually protect uh with AC rules or controller actions. So

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679
AC rules or controller actions. So

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.190
AC rules or controller actions. So that's why we also created this

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200
that's why we also created this

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.830
that's why we also created this annotation. So we able to with this ACL

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840
annotation. So we able to with this ACL

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.710
annotation. So we able to with this ACL annotation to both create rule and use

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720
annotation to both create rule and use

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.590
annotation to both create rule and use because if you create a rule inside ACL

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600
because if you create a rule inside ACL

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.990
because if you create a rule inside ACL YAML file which is also very correct

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000
YAML file which is also very correct

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.909
YAML file which is also very correct then you need to additionally still go

00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919
then you need to additionally still go

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:48.789
then you need to additionally still go to your controller and use this uh ACL

00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799
to your controller and use this uh ACL

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.909
to your controller and use this uh ACL ancestor annotation to protect a

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919
ancestor annotation to protect a

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:55.510
ancestor annotation to protect a controller action with existing uh rule

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520
controller action with existing uh rule

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.430
controller action with existing uh rule but if you prefer this way yeah I can

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440
but if you prefer this way yeah I can

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.029
but if you prefer this way yeah I can totally understand then you have all

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039
totally understand then you have all

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:01.750
totally understand then you have all definitions in yam files and then you're

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760
definitions in yam files and then you're

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.470
definitions in yam files and then you're using them in all other places. That's

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480
using them in all other places. That's

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.630
using them in all other places. That's also totally understandable.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640
also totally understandable.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.310
also totally understandable. Yeah. Yeah. I I I got it. I got it. So,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320
Yeah. Yeah. I I I got it. I got it. So,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.710
Yeah. Yeah. I I I got it. I got it. So, uh anyway on controller level, we should

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720
uh anyway on controller level, we should

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.789
uh anyway on controller level, we should always make a reference to

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799
always make a reference to

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:20.710
always make a reference to protect um

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.270
um

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280
um

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.669
um all right. All right. Uh and this

00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679
all right. All right. Uh and this

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:32.230
all right. All right. Uh and this permission uh view addit and so on. Um

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240
permission uh view addit and so on. Um

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.350
permission uh view addit and so on. Um it's a we have a limited type of uh this

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360
it's a we have a limited type of uh this

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.270
it's a we have a limited type of uh this permission. Uh

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.590
I I mean there is a list of permission

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600
I I mean there is a list of permission

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.710
I I mean there is a list of permission types. Uh it's uh

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720
types. Uh it's uh

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.110
types. Uh it's uh yeah so by default you have view,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120
yeah so by default you have view,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.350
yeah so by default you have view, delete, create, update and something and

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360
delete, create, update and something and

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.230
delete, create, update and something and yes you can create additional one and

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240
yes you can create additional one and

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.510
yes you can create additional one and you can do it. I will share my screen

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520
you can do it. I will share my screen

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.070
you can do it. I will share my screen and show you how you can do it.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080
and show you how you can do it.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.110
and show you how you can do it. You can do it with uh defining

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120
You can do it with uh defining

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.830
You can do it with uh defining additional we call it actually action

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840
additional we call it actually action

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.070
additional we call it actually action right so it's like view action on some

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080
right so it's like view action on some

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.190
right so it's like view action on some entity create action on some entity uh

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200
entity create action on some entity uh

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.710
entity create action on some entity uh and you can we had example somewhere

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720
and you can we had example somewhere

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.590
and you can we had example somewhere here

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.549
you can do it with uh

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559
you can do it with uh

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:25.510
you can do it with uh permissions file I don't remember on

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520
permissions file I don't remember on

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.110
permissions file I don't remember on which slide I had example but I had one.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.710
[Music]

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:43.510
I'm probably

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.590
Yeah, I I see there is a slide entity

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600
Yeah, I I see there is a slide entity

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.909
Yeah, I I see there is a slide entity permissions and

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:53.669
yeah I I see I see

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679
yeah I I see I see

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.470
yeah I I see I see ah here. Yes. So permissions. file. This

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480
ah here. Yes. So permissions. file. This

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.110
ah here. Yes. So permissions. file. This is the name of a file. And for example,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120
is the name of a file. And for example,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.710
is the name of a file. And for example, uh if you check this file, this is how

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720
uh if you check this file, this is how

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.750
uh if you check this file, this is how uh it's added this

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760
uh it's added this

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.390
uh it's added this for the price list. We have this one

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400
for the price list. We have this one

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.029
for the price list. We have this one recalculate action additional one. So

00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039
recalculate action additional one. So

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:16.630
recalculate action additional one. So I'm opening permissions file in IDE just

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640
I'm opening permissions file in IDE just

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.390
I'm opening permissions file in IDE just to show you that it's really super easy.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.430
Um

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.990
rising

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000
rising

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.149
rising okay

00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159
okay

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:32.630
okay uh so inside this y you just need to use

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640
uh so inside this y you just need to use

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.710
uh so inside this y you just need to use the sora permission name space and then

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720
the sora permission name space and then

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.590
the sora permission name space and then you have this identifier of your action

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600
you have this identifier of your action

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.909
you have this identifier of your action and it has label with this label it's

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919
and it has label with this label it's

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:43.669
and it has label with this label it's displayed later then uh here

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679
displayed later then uh here

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:46.950
displayed later then uh here this is the label and group name this

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960
this is the label and group name this

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.510
this is the label and group name this goes to back office and then you have to

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520
goes to back office and then you have to

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.390
goes to back office and then you have to switch so you can specify if This action

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400
switch so you can specify if This action

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.270
switch so you can specify if This action should be available to all entities and

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280
should be available to all entities and

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.909
should be available to all entities and this will be true for example for view

00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919
this will be true for example for view

00:20:57.919 --> 00:21:00.390
this will be true for example for view but actually we want it to be available

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400
but actually we want it to be available

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.549
but actually we want it to be available only on a price list entity. So this is

00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559
only on a price list entity. So this is

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:06.390
only on a price list entity. So this is how we say apply to all false but apply

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400
how we say apply to all false but apply

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.510
how we say apply to all false but apply it to some particular entity. So we can

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520
it to some particular entity. So we can

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.830
it to some particular entity. So we can always define another action if you want

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840
always define another action if you want

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.549
always define another action if you want for some particular entity.

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559
for some particular entity.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:18.310
for some particular entity. Okay. Okay. Um and uh let me share the

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320
Okay. Okay. Um and uh let me share the

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.830
Okay. Okay. Um and uh let me share the screen. I have one more question about

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840
screen. I have one more question about

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:34.870
screen. I have one more question about last name and

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.430
so do you see my screen?

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440
so do you see my screen?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.510
so do you see my screen? Oh yeah.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520
Oh yeah.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.310
Oh yeah. Um yeah. So this is uh entity I've set

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320
Um yeah. So this is uh entity I've set

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.950
Um yeah. So this is uh entity I've set up ACL.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960
up ACL.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.390
up ACL. It's quite clear. Uh when I executed

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400
It's quite clear. Uh when I executed

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.310
It's quite clear. Uh when I executed command it appeared in um rows uh

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320
command it appeared in um rows uh

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.250
command it appeared in um rows uh dashboard.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.260
dashboard.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.149
dashboard. [Music]

00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159
[Music]

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:05.270
[Music] So

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.270
it is this username name and type it is

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280
it is this username name and type it is

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.350
it is this username name and type it is clear for me. And uh about uh controller

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360
clear for me. And uh about uh controller

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.789
clear for me. And uh about uh controller uh it's a little bit more complicated as

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799
uh it's a little bit more complicated as

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:23.270
uh it's a little bit more complicated as I've understood. Uh so when we say

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280
I've understood. Uh so when we say

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.710
I've understood. Uh so when we say entity

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.830
I've seen also action type

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840
I've seen also action type

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.270
I've seen also action type what's the difference because it's not

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280
what's the difference because it's not

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.549
what's the difference because it's not clear and also the naming.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559
clear and also the naming.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:38.950
clear and also the naming. So the naming convention is basically

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960
So the naming convention is basically

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.190
So the naming convention is basically this way because our core bundle is

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200
this way because our core bundle is

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.870
this way because our core bundle is parsing this part and fetching

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880
parsing this part and fetching

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.110
parsing this part and fetching appropriate entity from it. So that's

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120
appropriate entity from it. So that's

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.870
appropriate entity from it. So that's just the naming convention that you need

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880
just the naming convention that you need

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.990
just the naming convention that you need to use to be consistent with our core

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000
to use to be consistent with our core

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.990
to use to be consistent with our core bundle uh security

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000
bundle uh security

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.710
bundle uh security but it can be but it can be class also.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720
but it can be but it can be class also.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:56.950
but it can be but it can be class also. Yeah,

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960
Yeah,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.830
Yeah, this is entity. This is a path to your

00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840
this is entity. This is a path to your

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.549
this is entity. This is a path to your entity. So this is actually uh going to

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559
entity. So this is actually uh going to

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.950
entity. So this is actually uh going to username type. So first part is the

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960
username type. So first part is the

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.830
username type. So first part is the bundle which this actual notation. So

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840
bundle which this actual notation. So

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.750
bundle which this actual notation. So you have to pass the name space and the

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760
you have to pass the name space and the

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.350
you have to pass the name space and the name of the bundle. Then you have a

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360
name of the bundle. Then you have a

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.750
name of the bundle. Then you have a colon and you have a name of the entity.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760
colon and you have a name of the entity.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.750
colon and you have a name of the entity. So usernaming type is your entity class.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760
So usernaming type is your entity class.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.070
So usernaming type is your entity class. And then because this is uh this is the

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080
And then because this is uh this is the

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.430
And then because this is uh this is the rule that will later uh we will check

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440
rule that will later uh we will check

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.830
rule that will later uh we will check and you will be able to go to the view

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840
and you will be able to go to the view

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.310
and you will be able to go to the view action only if the user that is logged

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320
action only if the user that is logged

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.909
action only if the user that is logged in has a view permission to usernaming

00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919
in has a view permission to usernaming

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.470
in has a view permission to usernaming type entity. So if you want to define

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480
type entity. So if you want to define

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.870
type entity. So if you want to define that kind of rule you use type entity

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880
that kind of rule you use type entity

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.710
that kind of rule you use type entity but you remember that we also have those

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720
but you remember that we also have those

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.390
but you remember that we also have those capabilities. So those action

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400
capabilities. So those action

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.710
capabilities. So those action permissions uh that you have only

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720
permissions uh that you have only

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.510
permissions uh that you have only checkbox right when you edit the role

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520
checkbox right when you edit the role

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.190
checkbox right when you edit the role you have list of entities and for

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200
you have list of entities and for

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.950
you have list of entities and for entities you have multiple actions like

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960
entities you have multiple actions like

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.990
entities you have multiple actions like view create etc. And then below when I

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000
view create etc. And then below when I

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.029
view create etc. And then below when I scrolled down we have also those checks

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039
scrolled down we have also those checks

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.470
scrolled down we have also those checks like true false. Okay. So if you a

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480
like true false. Okay. So if you a

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.029
like true false. Okay. So if you a little bit above oh those

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039
little bit above oh those

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:03.510
little bit above oh those above like marketing application

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520
above like marketing application

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.750
above like marketing application catalog. Yeah. So this is basically uh

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760
catalog. Yeah. So this is basically uh

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.630
catalog. Yeah. So this is basically uh an action. Okay. So if you want to check

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640
an action. Okay. So if you want to check

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.950
an action. Okay. So if you want to check some something and this is not connected

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960
some something and this is not connected

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.710
some something and this is not connected to entity. For example you want to

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720
to entity. For example you want to

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.669
to entity. For example you want to display button if someone has access to

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679
display button if someone has access to

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:20.710
display button if someone has access to generate PDFs or something. So this

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720
generate PDFs or something. So this

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.149
generate PDFs or something. So this would be

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159
would be

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:24.950
would be yeah this will be that kind of uh

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960
yeah this will be that kind of uh

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.590
yeah this will be that kind of uh element and then when you define it the

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600
element and then when you define it the

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.549
element and then when you define it the type is action and we don't have class

00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559
type is action and we don't have class

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.549
type is action and we don't have class as and permission here because it's not

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559
as and permission here because it's not

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:34.310
as and permission here because it's not connected to entity. So basically we

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320
connected to entity. So basically we

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.149
connected to entity. So basically we have only type action and you need to

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159
have only type action and you need to

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:37.909
have only type action and you need to give it some label because it will be

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919
give it some label because it will be

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.149
give it some label because it will be displayed with this label in the in the

00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159
displayed with this label in the in the

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:45.590
displayed with this label in the in the UI. Mhm. Uh and about this entity type,

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600
UI. Mhm. Uh and about this entity type,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.710
UI. Mhm. Uh and about this entity type, when you say it is entity type,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720
when you say it is entity type,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.789
when you say it is entity type, um it doesn't create resource here

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799
um it doesn't create resource here

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:56.950
um it doesn't create resource here because it's already created.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960
because it's already created.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.430
because it's already created. Uh this resource appears here if you

00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440
Uh this resource appears here if you

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.390
Uh this resource appears here if you enable security for entity. So with this

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400
enable security for entity. So with this

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.630
enable security for entity. So with this at config section you added this

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640
at config section you added this

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.630
at config section you added this security part and this with this part

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640
security part and this with this part

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.789
security part and this with this part and on the entity level inside your

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799
and on the entity level inside your

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:14.149
and on the entity level inside your entity

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:16.230
uh can you open entity class?

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240
uh can you open entity class?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:16.470
uh can you open entity class? Yeah.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480
Yeah.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.470
Yeah. Yeah. So with this security section with

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480
Yeah. So with this security section with

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.789
Yeah. So with this security section with this part you just said that you enable

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799
this part you just said that you enable

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:23.350
this part you just said that you enable ACL for this entity and that's why this

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360
ACL for this entity and that's why this

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.310
ACL for this entity and that's why this entity is available on the list and you

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320
entity is available on the list and you

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.710
entity is available on the list and you can specify

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720
can specify

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.510
can specify uh ACL permissions for this entity per

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520
uh ACL permissions for this entity per

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.710
uh ACL permissions for this entity per role on the role edit page.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720
role on the role edit page.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.789
role on the role edit page. So this part of code uh showed it in the

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799
So this part of code uh showed it in the

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:41.830
So this part of code uh showed it in the UI in the role edit and then in the

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840
UI in the role edit and then in the

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.070
UI in the role edit and then in the controller you need to uh specify the

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080
controller you need to uh specify the

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.950
controller you need to uh specify the actual rule. So we are checking for some

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960
actual rule. So we are checking for some

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.350
actual rule. So we are checking for some particular action. So here your view

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360
particular action. So here your view

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.909
particular action. So here your view action is protected only with permission

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919
action is protected only with permission

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.990
action is protected only with permission if you have a view access to this

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000
if you have a view access to this

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.870
if you have a view access to this entity. Okay. So on entity level in the

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880
entity. Okay. So on entity level in the

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.710
entity. Okay. So on entity level in the UI when you edit a role you have

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720
UI when you edit a role you have

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.789
UI when you edit a role you have multiple actions. You have view you have

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799
multiple actions. You have view you have

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:03.510
multiple actions. You have view you have create update and so on. And then if you

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520
create update and so on. And then if you

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.710
create update and so on. And then if you want to protect some piece of code with

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720
want to protect some piece of code with

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.510
want to protect some piece of code with some particular uh with permission to

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520
some particular uh with permission to

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.430
some particular uh with permission to some particular action you need this

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440
some particular action you need this

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.310
some particular action you need this rule. Okay. because this rule is

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320
rule. Okay. because this rule is

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.510
rule. Okay. because this rule is actually checking if you have view

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520
actually checking if you have view

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.110
actually checking if you have view permission to usernaming type entity.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120
permission to usernaming type entity.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.870
permission to usernaming type entity. Yeah. And uh when we when we configure

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880
Yeah. And uh when we when we configure

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.830
Yeah. And uh when we when we configure here do checkboxes uh when we

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840
here do checkboxes uh when we

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.830
here do checkboxes uh when we use this uh select options we also

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840
use this uh select options we also

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.029
use this uh select options we also create behind the scene we also create a

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039
create behind the scene we also create a

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:40.310
create behind the scene we also create a a rule. No, you need to create a rule in

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320
a rule. No, you need to create a rule in

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.350
a rule. No, you need to create a rule in code and you are protecting particular

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360
code and you are protecting particular

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.390
code and you are protecting particular places with this rule in code here. You

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400
places with this rule in code here. You

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.990
places with this rule in code here. You only change uh your permission. So if

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000
only change uh your permission. So if

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.630
only change uh your permission. So if you're logged in as administrator and

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640
you're logged in as administrator and

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.350
you're logged in as administrator and you will have permission here set to

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360
you will have permission here set to

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.789
you will have permission here set to view none then you will go get 403 when

00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799
view none then you will go get 403 when

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.750
view none then you will go get 403 when you enter the view page of usernaming

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760
you enter the view page of usernaming

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.830
you enter the view page of usernaming types.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840
types.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.390
types. Ro is a set of permission. So you here

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400
Ro is a set of permission. So you here

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.110
Ro is a set of permission. So you here specify

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120
specify

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.950
specify that you can access uh this entity or

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960
that you can access uh this entity or

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.029
that you can access uh this entity or not. But then in real if you want uh

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039
not. But then in real if you want uh

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:20.310
not. But then in real if you want uh this to be applicable on the index page

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320
this to be applicable on the index page

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.950
this to be applicable on the index page or on the view page of username types

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960
or on the view page of username types

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.510
or on the view page of username types you still need to in code specify that

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520
you still need to in code specify that

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.470
you still need to in code specify that this part of application should be

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480
this part of application should be

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.830
this part of application should be protected with this rule.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840
protected with this rule.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.590
protected with this rule. Okay. So uh I I should I should always

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600
Okay. So uh I I should I should always

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.950
Okay. So uh I I should I should always uh specify on control level as it's u

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.269
yeah if you remove this ACL part from

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279
yeah if you remove this ACL part from

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:51.510
yeah if you remove this ACL part from here then even if your role has access

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520
here then even if your role has access

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.590
here then even if your role has access uh doesn't have access to this entity

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600
uh doesn't have access to this entity

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.909
uh doesn't have access to this entity this part will not be protected with it.

00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919
this part will not be protected with it.

00:27:55.919 --> 00:28:00.230
this part will not be protected with it. So you can edit your role the restrict

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240
So you can edit your role the restrict

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.669
So you can edit your role the restrict uh view access and it will not have uh

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679
uh view access and it will not have uh

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:07.909
uh view access and it will not have uh it will not have um any action. You

00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919
it will not have um any action. You

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.830
it will not have um any action. You still need to go to code and actually

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840
still need to go to code and actually

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.149
still need to go to code and actually specify that this part of page should be

00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159
specify that this part of page should be

00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:14.870
specify that this part of page should be protected with this particular rule.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880
protected with this particular rule.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.160
protected with this particular rule. Yeah. Uh I've already

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.170
Yeah. Uh I've already

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.950
Yeah. Uh I've already [Music]

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960
[Music]

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.510
[Music] created a user with access to this user

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520
created a user with access to this user

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.470
created a user with access to this user type.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480
type.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.750
type. Mhm.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760
Mhm.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.149
Mhm. Uh so I've removed that code from from

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159
Uh so I've removed that code from from

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:32.630
Uh so I've removed that code from from controller 11

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640
controller 11

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.950
controller 11 and it's now

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.750
uh but

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760
uh but

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.110
uh but so this part of page is now not even

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120
so this part of page is now not even

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.990
so this part of page is now not even protected with any rules. So everybody

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000
protected with any rules. So everybody

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.990
protected with any rules. So everybody will see it.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.990
But if I go to usernaming

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000
But if I go to usernaming

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.070
But if I go to usernaming type and U

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:19.590
[Music]

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.830
No.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840
No.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.190
No. Yeah. Now you're just telling that your

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.669
Yeah. But it will not you will not see

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679
Yeah. But it will not you will not see

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.510
Yeah. But it will not you will not see any change because right now the view

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520
any change because right now the view

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.830
any change because right now the view action neither the index action nor the

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840
action neither the index action nor the

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.830
action neither the index action nor the view action are not protected with any

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840
view action are not protected with any

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.389
view action are not protected with any rule. So you can change your permission

00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399
rule. So you can change your permission

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:42.070
rule. So you can change your permission anytime any way you want. It will not

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080
anytime any way you want. It will not

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.110
anytime any way you want. It will not have any effect here.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120
have any effect here.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.510
have any effect here. Okay. So I see the controller is still

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520
Okay. So I see the controller is still

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.950
Okay. So I see the controller is still open.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960
open.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.590
open. But grid can't because it's an entity.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600
But grid can't because it's an entity.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.190
But grid can't because it's an entity. It's a

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200
It's a

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.750
It's a Yeah, it does have a impact just not

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760
Yeah, it does have a impact just not

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.310
Yeah, it does have a impact just not fully. It won't let me load entities of

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320
fully. It won't let me load entities of

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.350
fully. It won't let me load entities of that type. So like the grid ends up

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360
that type. So like the grid ends up

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.590
that type. So like the grid ends up empty and I assume if I try to view it

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600
empty and I assume if I try to view it

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.389
empty and I assume if I try to view it would be empty as well.

00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399
would be empty as well.

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:07.110
would be empty as well. Protected with this rule then uh yeah

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120
Protected with this rule then uh yeah

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.710
Protected with this rule then uh yeah but you probably also protected the

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720
but you probably also protected the

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.310
but you probably also protected the grid. Oh

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.830
well, I get the same result if I

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840
well, I get the same result if I

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.909
well, I get the same result if I So if you remove this then you will be

00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919
So if you remove this then you will be

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:20.950
So if you remove this then you will be able to see the grid back again.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960
able to see the grid back again.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.430
able to see the grid back again. So this is it. You have set of your

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440
So this is it. You have set of your

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.830
So this is it. You have set of your permissions but for those permission to

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840
permissions but for those permission to

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.870
permissions but for those permission to be applied on the page you need to

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880
be applied on the page you need to

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.909
be applied on the page you need to protect those places of codes like data

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919
protect those places of codes like data

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.830
protect those places of codes like data grid view action in controller index

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840
grid view action in controller index

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.430
grid view action in controller index action in controller with some

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440
action in controller with some

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.909
action in controller with some particular rule only then application

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919
particular rule only then application

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.230
particular rule only then application will actually check ACL because without

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240
will actually check ACL because without

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.310
will actually check ACL because without those rules application will not even

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320
those rules application will not even

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.789
those rules application will not even check any ACL and resource will be

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799
check any ACL and resource will be

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:51.240
check any ACL and resource will be available for everybody.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:31:09.669
[Music]

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:14.070
You can test it on the view page

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080
You can test it on the view page

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.720
You can test it on the view page easier probably.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:17.730
easier probably.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.310
easier probably. [Music]

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320
[Music]

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.070
[Music] No, no, no.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080
No, no, no.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.149
No, no, no. I I think uh that when we

00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159
I I think uh that when we

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:32.950
I I think uh that when we do update here, it creates a rule

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960
do update here, it creates a rule

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.520
do update here, it creates a rule set of rules for entity.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:36.530
set of rules for entity.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.549
set of rules for entity. [Music]

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.549
Yeah. So basically if I if you set your

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559
Yeah. So basically if I if you set your

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.389
Yeah. So basically if I if you set your view to none on user naming type the

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399
view to none on user naming type the

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.389
view to none on user naming type the grid doesn't load because the code

00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399
grid doesn't load because the code

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:47.909
grid doesn't load because the code behind the scenes is saying you don't

00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919
behind the scenes is saying you don't

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.470
behind the scenes is saying you don't have access to the entity level to view

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480
have access to the entity level to view

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.549
have access to the entity level to view the entity and so it creates an empty

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559
the entity and so it creates an empty

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.870
the entity and so it creates an empty grid. If I go switch between I removed

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880
grid. If I go switch between I removed

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.430
grid. If I go switch between I removed all the ACL's from my controller. My

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440
all the ACL's from my controller. My

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.070
all the ACL's from my controller. My controller is completely ACL free. When

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080
controller is completely ACL free. When

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.230
controller is completely ACL free. When I go to the grid if I've got it set to

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240
I go to the grid if I've got it set to

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.230
I go to the grid if I've got it set to none I get an empty grid. If I have it

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240
none I get an empty grid. If I have it

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.710
none I get an empty grid. If I have it set to global I get a grid with my

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720
set to global I get a grid with my

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.190
set to global I get a grid with my usernaming types. So like

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200
usernaming types. So like

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.789
usernaming types. So like there's two levels. There's controller

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799
there's two levels. There's controller

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.789
there's two levels. There's controller in entity level ACL.

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799
in entity level ACL.

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:15.750
in entity level ACL. Yeah. So that's because there is also uh

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760
Yeah. So that's because there is also uh

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.950
Yeah. So that's because there is also uh this uh ACL helper and that I've shown

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960
this uh ACL helper and that I've shown

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.870
this uh ACL helper and that I've shown you you have it also on one of the

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880
you you have it also on one of the

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.750
you you have it also on one of the slides that some part of our code are

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760
slides that some part of our code are

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.070
slides that some part of our code are additionally when we're building a query

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080
additionally when we're building a query

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.710
additionally when we're building a query we can additionally apply ACL on top of

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720
we can additionally apply ACL on top of

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.430
we can additionally apply ACL on top of it. So while uh you're building a query

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440
it. So while uh you're building a query

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.149
it. So while uh you're building a query to the database like where's uh select

00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159
to the database like where's uh select

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:36.230
to the database like where's uh select something where something you can also

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240
something where something you can also

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.669
something where something you can also kind of then parse it through the ACL

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679
kind of then parse it through the ACL

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:41.909
kind of then parse it through the ACL helper. So you will have your initial

00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919
helper. So you will have your initial

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:43.509
helper. So you will have your initial query that will fetch something from

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519
query that will fetch something from

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:47.509
query that will fetch something from database and on top of it we'll add um

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519
database and on top of it we'll add um

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:50.389
database and on top of it we'll add um ACL permissions. So in this particular

00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399
ACL permissions. So in this particular

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:52.789
ACL permissions. So in this particular situations this will just work because

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799
situations this will just work because

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:55.190
situations this will just work because we are using this helper but this is not

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200
we are using this helper but this is not

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.909
we are using this helper but this is not available on every part of Aro. Um so

00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919
available on every part of Aro. Um so

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.509
available on every part of Aro. Um so you need to actually know how to

00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519
you need to actually know how to

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:04.630
you need to actually know how to manually also protect something with a

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640
manually also protect something with a

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.669
manually also protect something with a rule. So how to how to create a rule. So

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679
rule. So how to how to create a rule. So

00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:10.549
rule. So how to how to create a rule. So the rule is not created when you change

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559
the rule is not created when you change

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:14.070
the rule is not created when you change permission uh level in the role edit

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080
permission uh level in the role edit

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.269
permission uh level in the role edit page. We do not create a rule there. The

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279
page. We do not create a rule there. The

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.029
page. We do not create a rule there. The reason that we are not seeing those

00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039
reason that we are not seeing those

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:21.590
reason that we are not seeing those entities on the data grid is because

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600
entities on the data grid is because

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.470
entities on the data grid is because probably the data grid builder when it's

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480
probably the data grid builder when it's

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.430
probably the data grid builder when it's building the select statement that is

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440
building the select statement that is

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.830
building the select statement that is fetching entities from database is

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840
fetching entities from database is

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.310
fetching entities from database is additionally using this PHP service

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320
additionally using this PHP service

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.870
additionally using this PHP service called ACL helper and is additionally

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880
called ACL helper and is additionally

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.230
called ACL helper and is additionally for you applying uh the ACL permission

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240
for you applying uh the ACL permission

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.590
for you applying uh the ACL permission but the rules are only built like by

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600
but the rules are only built like by

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.830
but the rules are only built like by you. Mhm. No, I understand. I was just

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840
you. Mhm. No, I understand. I was just

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.830
you. Mhm. No, I understand. I was just saying like out of the box there is some

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840
saying like out of the box there is some

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.630
saying like out of the box there is some extra behind the scenes things happening

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640
extra behind the scenes things happening

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.190
extra behind the scenes things happening based on the entity permissions like you

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200
based on the entity permissions like you

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.190
based on the entity permissions like you can also if I disable delete the delete

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200
can also if I disable delete the delete

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.310
can also if I disable delete the delete button goes away. So like there's other

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320
button goes away. So like there's other

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.909
button goes away. So like there's other that's that's all I was trying to say is

00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919
that's that's all I was trying to say is

00:33:57.919 --> 00:34:00.149
that's that's all I was trying to say is like how it happens

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159
like how it happens

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.669
like how it happens you know whatever.

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679
you know whatever.

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.029
you know whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is exactly

00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is exactly

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.190
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is exactly this ACL helper. There's there is one

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200
this ACL helper. There's there is one

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.109
this ACL helper. There's there is one service uh responsible for this and uh

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119
service uh responsible for this and uh

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:11.349
service uh responsible for this and uh it's basically checking additionally in

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359
it's basically checking additionally in

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:13.589
it's basically checking additionally in the PHP code right so for example when

00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599
the PHP code right so for example when

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:16.790
the PHP code right so for example when building queries. Uh I think I've shown

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800
building queries. Uh I think I've shown

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.669
building queries. Uh I think I've shown you this on the search example when we

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679
you this on the search example when we

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.430
you this on the search example when we are searching in the global search in

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440
are searching in the global search in

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.270
are searching in the global search in the back office. uh also ACL is applied

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280
the back office. uh also ACL is applied

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.909
the back office. uh also ACL is applied there because while building query to

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919
there because while building query to

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.950
there because while building query to search index we use this H ACL helper on

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960
search index we use this H ACL helper on

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.069
search index we use this H ACL helper on top of it.

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079
top of it.

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.190
top of it. Mhm. Okay.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200
Mhm. Okay.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.990
Mhm. Okay. So yeah there is also some out ofthe-box

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000
So yeah there is also some out ofthe-box

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.069
So yeah there is also some out ofthe-box functionality that it's automatically

00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079
functionality that it's automatically

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:41.510
functionality that it's automatically applying ACL here and there but it's

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520
applying ACL here and there but it's

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.950
applying ACL here and there but it's done via calling PHP services not with

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960
done via calling PHP services not with

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.310
done via calling PHP services not with creating those rules.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320
creating those rules.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.869
creating those rules. Yeah. So if we doing something custom,

00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879
Yeah. So if we doing something custom,

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.230
Yeah. So if we doing something custom, we have to make sure to do that. And

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240
we have to make sure to do that. And

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.430
we have to make sure to do that. And it's a good idea to do it on the

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440
it's a good idea to do it on the

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.349
it's a good idea to do it on the controllers to just avoid mistakes as

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359
controllers to just avoid mistakes as

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.869
controllers to just avoid mistakes as well. Like I'm not

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879
well. Like I'm not

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:56.550
well. Like I'm not saying we don't have to do that. I was

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560
saying we don't have to do that. I was

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.190
saying we don't have to do that. I was just pointing out there was some level

00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200
just pointing out there was some level

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.910
just pointing out there was some level of protection in case maybe you forget.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920
of protection in case maybe you forget.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.829
of protection in case maybe you forget. Um it does like the core is kind of

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839
Um it does like the core is kind of

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:05.589
Um it does like the core is kind of helping out and saying, you know, don't

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599
helping out and saying, you know, don't

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.270
helping out and saying, you know, don't let you do these certain things. And

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280
let you do these certain things. And

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.270
let you do these certain things. And also considering we did the automatic

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280
also considering we did the automatic

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.510
also considering we did the automatic delete, we had no way of protecting our

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520
delete, we had no way of protecting our

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.390
delete, we had no way of protecting our delete. But the core code protects it

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400
delete. But the core code protects it

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.069
delete. But the core code protects it for us if we disable the delete

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079
for us if we disable the delete

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:17.910
for us if we disable the delete permission. And if we wanted to be more

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920
permission. And if we wanted to be more

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.829
permission. And if we wanted to be more explicit, we'd have to define a delete

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839
explicit, we'd have to define a delete

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:21.030
explicit, we'd have to define a delete in our controller.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040
in our controller.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.910
in our controller. So if you define manually delete for

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920
So if you define manually delete for

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.150
So if you define manually delete for example for data grid because you can,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160
example for data grid because you can,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.950
example for data grid because you can, right? Yep.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960
right? Yep.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.630
right? Yep. And then you will need to protect it

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640
And then you will need to protect it

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.069
And then you will need to protect it with this ACL. Um

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079
with this ACL. Um

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:35.670
with this ACL. Um in yams we have this way to protect ACL.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680
in yams we have this way to protect ACL.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.829
in yams we have this way to protect ACL. It's a resource, right?

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839
It's a resource, right?

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.910
It's a resource, right? Uh but if you use this one that is

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920
Uh but if you use this one that is

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.310
Uh but if you use this one that is globally and uh created the globally

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320
globally and uh created the globally

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.750
globally and uh created the globally created delete button and we are

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760
created delete button and we are

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.670
created delete button and we are actually using this one then yes

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680
actually using this one then yes

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.390
actually using this one then yes additionally there the ACL rules are

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400
additionally there the ACL rules are

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.190
additionally there the ACL rules are also applied. So yes you are correct.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200
also applied. So yes you are correct.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.670
also applied. So yes you are correct. There are many places that we

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680
There are many places that we

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.589
There are many places that we additionally apply ACL but this practice

00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599
additionally apply ACL but this practice

00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:59.829
additionally apply ACL but this practice was all about to show you how you can

00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839
was all about to show you how you can

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:02.230
was all about to show you how you can manually make sure that something is

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240
manually make sure that something is

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:09.750
manually make sure that something is protected with some permission.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.390
All right. And also you can

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400
All right. And also you can

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.510
All right. And also you can so many options to configure.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520
so many options to configure.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.710
so many options to configure. Yeah, this ACL it's uh you have you have

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720
Yeah, this ACL it's uh you have you have

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.750
Yeah, this ACL it's uh you have you have options and you can also check uh

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760
options and you can also check uh

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.990
options and you can also check uh because for the menu we have this

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000
because for the menu we have this

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.430
because for the menu we have this extension that is also checking routes.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440
extension that is also checking routes.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.550
extension that is also checking routes. So if you protect index route with some

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560
So if you protect index route with some

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.510
So if you protect index route with some ACL and refresh the page this menu

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520
ACL and refresh the page this menu

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.670
ACL and refresh the page this menu element should disappear. So you can

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680
element should disappear. So you can

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.990
element should disappear. So you can check even now that if you protect index

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000
check even now that if you protect index

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.109
check even now that if you protect index um

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.829
with this rule then you will yeah

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839
with this rule then you will yeah

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:48.710
with this rule then you will yeah basically the menu is also kind of in

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720
basically the menu is also kind of in

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.430
basically the menu is also kind of in the background using the ACL for you. So

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440
the background using the ACL for you. So

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.510
the background using the ACL for you. So the menu element will disappear if you

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520
the menu element will disappear if you

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.710
the menu element will disappear if you don't have access to uh browse the page.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720
don't have access to uh browse the page.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.550
don't have access to uh browse the page. Right. So this is some additional

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560
Right. So this is some additional

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.430
Right. So this is some additional element that you will have automatically

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440
element that you will have automatically

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:01.589
element that you will have automatically and

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599
and

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.109
and that's just based on the path matching

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119
that's just based on the path matching

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.670
that's just based on the path matching because it when we specify the menu we

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680
because it when we specify the menu we

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.390
because it when we specify the menu we point it at a particular key that points

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400
point it at a particular key that points

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.390
point it at a particular key that points to that route. Yeah.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400
to that route. Yeah.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:10.870
to that route. Yeah. Mhm.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880
Mhm.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:17.430
Mhm. Okay.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.230
Okay. I don't have example route but

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240
Okay. I don't have example route but

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.950
Okay. I don't have example route but I'll check it later. So here you have a

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960
I'll check it later. So here you have a

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.150
I'll check it later. So here you have a route training usernaming index in the

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160
route training usernaming index in the

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.790
route training usernaming index in the item line six. So if you protect this

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800
item line six. So if you protect this

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.430
item line six. So if you protect this controller action that leads to this

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440
controller action that leads to this

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.270
controller action that leads to this controller action. So index action in a

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280
controller action. So index action in a

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.390
controller action. So index action in a controller. If you protect it with uh

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400
controller. If you protect it with uh

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.310
controller. If you protect it with uh view permission and you will not have

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320
view permission and you will not have

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.630
view permission and you will not have access to the view permission this item

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640
access to the view permission this item

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:46.550
access to the view permission this item will also disappear from the menu.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.310
Okay. So

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320
Okay. So

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.950
Okay. So you cannot twice create the same. If you

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960
you cannot twice create the same. If you

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.109
you cannot twice create the same. If you want to reuse existing rule, please use

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119
want to reuse existing rule, please use

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.829
want to reuse existing rule, please use ACL ancestor annotation. And to this

00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839
ACL ancestor annotation. And to this

00:37:55.839 --> 00:38:02.710
ACL ancestor annotation. And to this annotation, you only pass the name of uh

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720
annotation, you only pass the name of uh

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.750
annotation, you only pass the name of uh ACL ancestor and then double quotes and

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760
ACL ancestor and then double quotes and

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:20.069
ACL ancestor and then double quotes and inside only the ID of your rule.

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:23.750
without ID the only pass the name. Yeah.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760
without ID the only pass the name. Yeah.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.589
without ID the only pass the name. Yeah. Pass the identifier. Mhm.

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:32.150
So this means reusing existing. So if

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160
So this means reusing existing. So if

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.470
So this means reusing existing. So if you'd like to if you prefer to create

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480
you'd like to if you prefer to create

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.550
you'd like to if you prefer to create this rule in the YAML file then with ACL

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560
this rule in the YAML file then with ACL

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.230
this rule in the YAML file then with ACL ancestor annotation you're basically

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240
ancestor annotation you're basically

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.550
ancestor annotation you're basically using it

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.390
and now your index page is also

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400
and now your index page is also

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.990
and now your index page is also protected with this rule. So you should

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000
protected with this rule. So you should

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.750
protected with this rule. So you should not be able to go to index page and you

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760
not be able to go to index page and you

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.750
not be able to go to index page and you should not see the

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760
should not see the

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.470
should not see the element in the menu.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480
element in the menu.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.470
element in the menu. You can refresh and

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480
You can refresh and

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.550
You can refresh and uh just check the menu because menu goes

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560
uh just check the menu because menu goes

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:14.150
uh just check the menu because menu goes from here too.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.430
I didn't

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440
I didn't

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.920
I didn't you may be

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:16.930
you may be

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:44.390
you may be [Music]

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.390
So you need to go to some other page

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400
So you need to go to some other page

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.270
So you need to go to some other page like just go to main page and check the

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280
like just go to main page and check the

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.390
like just go to main page and check the menu.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.870
No, there is no menu.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880
No, there is no menu.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.950
No, there is no menu. Uh okay. So you would need to probably

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960
Uh okay. So you would need to probably

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.510
Uh okay. So you would need to probably log in as administrator and just do this

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520
log in as administrator and just do this

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.950
log in as administrator and just do this for the administrator.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960
for the administrator.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.750
for the administrator. No, no, it's fine. I see that it's

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760
No, no, it's fine. I see that it's

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.190
No, no, it's fine. I see that it's working.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.589
So that's if I want to protect.

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599
So that's if I want to protect.

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:17.750
So that's if I want to protect. So usually the index action and view

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760
So usually the index action and view

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.069
So usually the index action and view action are both protected with view

00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079
action are both protected with view

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:22.870
action are both protected with view permission which makes sense because on

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880
permission which makes sense because on

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.190
permission which makes sense because on the index you have a list of entities.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200
the index you have a list of entities.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.870
the index you have a list of entities. So if you don't have view permission you

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880
So if you don't have view permission you

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.109
So if you don't have view permission you shouldn't see the list right? So this is

00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119
shouldn't see the list right? So this is

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:31.910
shouldn't see the list right? So this is kind of normal that both uh view and

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920
kind of normal that both uh view and

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.990
kind of normal that both uh view and index action are protected with the view

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000
index action are protected with the view

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.030
index action are protected with the view permission.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.589
All right. And same for buttons. We can

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599
All right. And same for buttons. We can

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.910
All right. And same for buttons. We can we can configure this. I mean on the

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920
we can configure this. I mean on the

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.750
we can configure this. I mean on the grid we have different buttons like

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760
grid we have different buttons like

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.829
grid we have different buttons like create update.

00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839
create update.

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:49.910
create update. Mhm. And you can uh also specify

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920
Mhm. And you can uh also specify

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.310
Mhm. And you can uh also specify um ACL per action. So maybe not in this

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.320
um ACL per action. So maybe not in this

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.829
um ACL per action. So maybe not in this particular case but if you'll have some

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839
particular case but if you'll have some

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:58.150
particular case but if you'll have some custom action like generate PDF or

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160
custom action like generate PDF or

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.990
custom action like generate PDF or something you can also protect

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000
something you can also protect

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.470
something you can also protect particular action with uh ACL. So you

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480
particular action with uh ACL. So you

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.230
particular action with uh ACL. So you can protect whole grid but you can also

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240
can protect whole grid but you can also

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.630
can protect whole grid but you can also only protect an action and annotation.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640
only protect an action and annotation.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.109
only protect an action and annotation. Uh I mean the keyword is the same. It's

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119
Uh I mean the keyword is the same. It's

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:11.430
Uh I mean the keyword is the same. It's every time it's ACL

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440
every time it's ACL

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.870
every time it's ACL uh rule.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880
uh rule.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.950
uh rule. Yeah. By the way uh you have said that

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960
Yeah. By the way uh you have said that

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.550
Yeah. By the way uh you have said that you have an extension for PHP store.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560
you have an extension for PHP store.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.910
you have an extension for PHP store. Yeah it's called plugin.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920
Yeah it's called plugin.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:30.309
Yeah it's called plugin. Uh, can you open plugins?

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:34.790
Mhm. And start typing or

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800
Mhm. And start typing or

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.190
Mhm. And start typing or uh not installed in marketplace. Uhhuh.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200
uh not installed in marketplace. Uhhuh.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:44.230
uh not installed in marketplace. Uhhuh. This one

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.510
it has some errors sometimes like yeah I

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520
it has some errors sometimes like yeah I

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.750
it has some errors sometimes like yeah I do see this ID error occurred but it's

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760
do see this ID error occurred but it's

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.910
do see this ID error occurred but it's still working.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920
still working.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.470
still working. You need to give it time for scan and

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480
You need to give it time for scan and

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.670
You need to give it time for scan and index everything.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680
index everything.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.550
index everything. We working on this plugin actually. So I

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560
We working on this plugin actually. So I

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.589
We working on this plugin actually. So I hopefully

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:05.910
yeah ACL resource and you have you see

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920
yeah ACL resource and you have you see

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.230
yeah ACL resource and you have you see it's throwing some Java errors in the

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240
it's throwing some Java errors in the

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.230
it's throwing some Java errors in the background but it's still working.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.829
Okay.

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839
Okay.

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:24.069
Okay. I see. Thank you.

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:27.510
Uh, okay guys. So,

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520
Uh, okay guys. So,

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.829
Uh, okay guys. So, any questions?

00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839
any questions?

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.630
any questions? Any other questions? Uh, Victor, what

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640
Any other questions? Uh, Victor, what

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.069
Any other questions? Uh, Victor, what about you? What's your status?

00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079
about you? What's your status?

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:39.030
about you? What's your status? I was able to create this all CCL rules

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040
I was able to create this all CCL rules

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.190
I was able to create this all CCL rules and that's optional as well. However, I

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200
and that's optional as well. However, I

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.030
and that's optional as well. However, I get stuck on testing because I've tried

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040
get stuck on testing because I've tried

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.230
get stuck on testing because I've tried to create the new customer then that

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240
to create the new customer then that

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.109
to create the new customer then that issue with its login because it's uh

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119
issue with its login because it's uh

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:52.150
issue with its login because it's uh requiring to enter. So check the email

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160
requiring to enter. So check the email

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.910
requiring to enter. So check the email and mail cer was not set up on my docker

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920
and mail cer was not set up on my docker

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.510
and mail cer was not set up on my docker uh so stuck on this testing uh

00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520
uh so stuck on this testing uh

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.510
uh so stuck on this testing uh but basically it works.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520
but basically it works.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.349
but basically it works. Yeah in general I I did solve this items

00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359
Yeah in general I I did solve this items

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:09.430
Yeah in general I I did solve this items within the ACL.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440
within the ACL.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.270
within the ACL. Yeah. You can test with the

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280
Yeah. You can test with the

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.950
Yeah. You can test with the administrator role as well. You can just

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960
administrator role as well. You can just

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.870
administrator role as well. You can just change since you can change your own

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880
change since you can change your own

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.710
change since you can change your own permissions. It it's testable that way.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720
permissions. It it's testable that way.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.470
permissions. It it's testable that way. You just need to create customer. It's

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480
You just need to create customer. It's

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.710
You just need to create customer. It's not the storefront. We're testing it in

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720
not the storefront. We're testing it in

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.910
not the storefront. We're testing it in the back office.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920
the back office.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.710
the back office. Mhm.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720
Mhm.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.190
Mhm. So customer, this is for storefront. So,

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200
So customer, this is for storefront. So,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.870
So customer, this is for storefront. So, I'm not sure what you wanted to test,

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880
I'm not sure what you wanted to test,

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.910
I'm not sure what you wanted to test, but I assume that maybe you did some

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920
but I assume that maybe you did some

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.910
but I assume that maybe you did some rule

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920
rule

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.309
rule there or tried to check the storefront

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319
there or tried to check the storefront

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:40.710
there or tried to check the storefront part of it, but for the practice, we're

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720
part of it, but for the practice, we're

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.550
part of it, but for the practice, we're just generating rules for back office

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560
just generating rules for back office

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.270
just generating rules for back office roles.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280
roles.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.870
roles. Yeah, right. So, let me

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880
Yeah, right. So, let me

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.069
Yeah, right. So, let me I think he was just trying to create a

00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079
I think he was just trying to create a

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:48.870
I think he was just trying to create a new back office user with a restricted

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880
new back office user with a restricted

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.829
new back office user with a restricted role.

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839
role.

00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:52.390
role. But you can test with your

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400
But you can test with your

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.589
But you can test with your with your user.

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599
with your user.

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:56.150
with your user. So, I didn't I didn't try to test with

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160
So, I didn't I didn't try to test with

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.790
So, I didn't I didn't try to test with my own cuz I You don't explicitly have

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800
my own cuz I You don't explicitly have

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.150
my own cuz I You don't explicitly have Yeah, you don't have permissions to

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160
Yeah, you don't have permissions to

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.190
Yeah, you don't have permissions to everything.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200
everything.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.390
everything. Yeah, right.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400
Yeah, right.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.390
Yeah, right. It is a bit weird. Um, but yeah, as

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400
It is a bit weird. Um, but yeah, as

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.630
It is a bit weird. Um, but yeah, as administrator, you have the ability to

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640
administrator, you have the ability to

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.950
administrator, you have the ability to adjust roles. So, you can change your

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960
adjust roles. So, you can change your

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.710
adjust roles. So, you can change your own role to restrict yourself.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720
own role to restrict yourself.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.550
own role to restrict yourself. You can change administrator role and

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560
You can change administrator role and

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.150
You can change administrator role and then you don't need to log out or

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160
then you don't need to log out or

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.870
then you don't need to log out or anything.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880
anything.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.349
anything. Mhm.

00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359
Mhm.

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:19.829
Mhm. So, you can create new role just to

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839
So, you can create new role just to

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:22.150
So, you can create new role just to practice. You can create new user just

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160
practice. You can create new user just

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.550
practice. You can create new user just to practice if you want. But if you want

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560
to practice if you want. But if you want

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.109
to practice if you want. But if you want to test it like the quickest way

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119
to test it like the quickest way

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:29.109
to test it like the quickest way possible, just add it administrator

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119
possible, just add it administrator

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:32.710
possible, just add it administrator role. And yeah,

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720
role. And yeah,

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.870
role. And yeah, a second. I will show what I have there,

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880
a second. I will show what I have there,

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:48.550
a second. I will show what I have there, man.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.470
That's my entity. Uh it's global and

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480
That's my entity. Uh it's global and

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.030
That's my entity. Uh it's global and And um there is my

00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040
And um there is my

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.510
And um there is my additional permissions all say I set to

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520
additional permissions all say I set to

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.910
additional permissions all say I set to entity. So it's username and related

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920
entity. So it's username and related

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.510
entity. So it's username and related users

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520
users

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.550
users uh which is created there. One second.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560
uh which is created there. One second.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.109
uh which is created there. One second. But why you created this as an action?

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119
But why you created this as an action?

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:13.510
But why you created this as an action? One second. Let me

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520
One second. Let me

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.069
One second. Let me open it.

00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079
open it.

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:16.390
open it. It's not supposed to be an action. It's

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400
It's not supposed to be an action. It's

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.750
It's not supposed to be an action. It's supposed to be entity rule.

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760
supposed to be entity rule.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.109
supposed to be entity rule. So I have created their ACL's one for

00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119
So I have created their ACL's one for

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:25.349
So I have created their ACL's one for the data grid for the one for the

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359
the data grid for the one for the

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:28.790
the data grid for the one for the related users and then assigned the same

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800
related users and then assigned the same

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.230
related users and then assigned the same for the uh data grid. So there I have

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240
for the uh data grid. So there I have

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.550
for the uh data grid. So there I have assigned the data grid I have assigned

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560
assigned the data grid I have assigned

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.790
assigned the data grid I have assigned uh related users

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800
uh related users

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.230
uh related users okay and can you show me your controller

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240
okay and can you show me your controller

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.550
okay and can you show me your controller because I show saw too many actions

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560
because I show saw too many actions

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.790
because I show saw too many actions there. Okay. So this is not supposed to

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800
there. Okay. So this is not supposed to

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.270
there. Okay. So this is not supposed to go to action because here you your view

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280
go to action because here you your view

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.109
go to action because here you your view action right now is protected with some

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119
action right now is protected with some

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.349
action right now is protected with some action. So with a checkbox uh with

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359
action. So with a checkbox uh with

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:56.069
action. So with a checkbox uh with capability and we actually wanted to

00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079
capability and we actually wanted to

00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:58.630
capability and we actually wanted to protect this with the view permission on

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640
protect this with the view permission on

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.470
protect this with the view permission on entity level.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480
entity level.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.510
entity level. Mhm.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520
Mhm.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.829
Mhm. So this one can you switch back to uh

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839
So this one can you switch back to uh

00:46:05.839 --> 00:46:09.510
So this one can you switch back to uh the UI to the RO edit page?

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520
the UI to the RO edit page?

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.950
the UI to the RO edit page? Uh here your view controller action is

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960
Uh here your view controller action is

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.630
Uh here your view controller action is actually protected with those this

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640
actually protected with those this

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.990
actually protected with those this checkbox called user naming type index

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000
checkbox called user naming type index

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.069
checkbox called user naming type index action but you are not supposed to

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079
action but you are not supposed to

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.790
action but you are not supposed to protect it with this but with this here

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800
protect it with this but with this here

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.069
protect it with this but with this here usernaming type view global and to do it

00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079
usernaming type view global and to do it

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:28.630
usernaming type view global and to do it your rule it's not supposed to be action

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640
your rule it's not supposed to be action

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.910
your rule it's not supposed to be action it's supposed to be entity and act and

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920
it's supposed to be entity and act and

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.309
it's supposed to be entity and act and please check other

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319
please check other

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:35.990
please check other some other example because you need to

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000
some other example because you need to

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.470
some other example because you need to specify entity for this and you need to

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480
specify entity for this and you need to

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.990
specify entity for this and you need to specify action

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000
specify action

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.589
specify action So no label here because we don't have

00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599
So no label here because we don't have

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:46.390
So no label here because we don't have any additional label in the UI. But you

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400
any additional label in the UI. But you

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.790
any additional label in the UI. But you need to specify which entity and which

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800
need to specify which entity and which

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.790
need to specify which entity and which action. So you need to specify that it's

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800
action. So you need to specify that it's

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.470
action. So you need to specify that it's usernaming type entity and uh that

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480
usernaming type entity and uh that

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.030
usernaming type entity and uh that permission is

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040
permission is

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:05.589
permission is a view. So uh this one exactly

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:08.390
I thought I I just copied this ACL from

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400
I thought I I just copied this ACL from

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.390
I thought I I just copied this ACL from some other example.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400
some other example.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.550
some other example. Mhm. Yeah. Because you have two slides.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560
Mhm. Yeah. Because you have two slides.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.190
Mhm. Yeah. Because you have two slides. One for entity permissions and one for

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200
One for entity permissions and one for

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.510
One for entity permissions and one for action permissions.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520
action permissions.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.309
action permissions. So the entity goes to the list of

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319
So the entity goes to the list of

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:22.630
So the entity goes to the list of entities with this view create update

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640
entities with this view create update

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.470
entities with this view create update and so on. And action this is

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480
and so on. And action this is

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.990
and so on. And action this is capability. So this checkbox

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000
capability. So this checkbox

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.470
capability. So this checkbox truth is there. Okay, I believe that the

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480
truth is there. Okay, I believe that the

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.230
truth is there. Okay, I believe that the entity

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240
entity

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.710
entity yeah the entity format that you need to

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720
yeah the entity format that you need to

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.190
yeah the entity format that you need to pass here it's a bit different see you

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200
pass here it's a bit different see you

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.109
pass here it's a bit different see you have oro user bundle so this is

00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119
have oro user bundle so this is

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:41.910
have oro user bundle so this is namespace plus bundle name and then you

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920
namespace plus bundle name and then you

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.109
namespace plus bundle name and then you have the entity name after column so for

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119
have the entity name after column so for

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:47.109
have the entity name after column so for you it will be training usernaming

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119
you it will be training usernaming

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:49.349
you it will be training usernaming bundle

00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359
bundle

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.150
bundle right

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160
right

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.390
right uhhuh exactly and the usernaming type

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400
uhhuh exactly and the usernaming type

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.510
uhhuh exactly and the usernaming type this will be after the column yeah

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520
this will be after the column yeah

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.069
this will be after the column yeah that's

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:03.670
I believe with this it will disappear

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680
I believe with this it will disappear

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.150
I believe with this it will disappear those to create

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160
those to create

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.349
those to create and you cannot create uh twice a rule

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359
and you cannot create uh twice a rule

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:11.349
and you cannot create uh twice a rule with the same identifier. If you want to

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359
with the same identifier. If you want to

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:14.550
with the same identifier. If you want to reuse existing rule and what you want to

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.560
reuse existing rule and what you want to

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.230
reuse existing rule and what you want to do here uh uh you can use ACL ancestor

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240
do here uh uh you can use ACL ancestor

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.510
do here uh uh you can use ACL ancestor annotation to reuse existing rule. So in

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520
annotation to reuse existing rule. So in

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.030
annotation to reuse existing rule. So in this case uh instead of ACL annotation

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040
this case uh instead of ACL annotation

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.430
this case uh instead of ACL annotation Mhm.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440
Mhm.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.230
Mhm. please use ACL ancestor annotation and

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240
please use ACL ancestor annotation and

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.549
please use ACL ancestor annotation and in the brackets

00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559
in the brackets

00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:33.670
in the brackets uh you put put only the name of your

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680
uh you put put only the name of your

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.190
uh you put put only the name of your rule identifier of your rule in double

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200
rule identifier of your rule in double

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.109
rule identifier of your rule in double quotes and that's it.

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:59.750
So delete everything and just pass

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.670
I need to reload.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680
I need to reload.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.030
I need to reload. Just pass the identifier. Do not set ID.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040
Just pass the identifier. Do not set ID.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.510
Just pass the identifier. Do not set ID. Just pass identifier. ACL ancestor open

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520
Just pass identifier. ACL ancestor open

You are using training usernaming type

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.910
You are using training usernaming type rule but you don't have a rule with

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920
rule but you don't have a rule with

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.309
rule but you don't have a rule with this. You have train. Ah okay. Sorry I

probably

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:10.309
probably or need config update.

00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319
or need config update.

00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:12.549
or need config update. Um no we don't need to execute any

00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559
Um no we don't need to execute any

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:16.069
Um no we don't need to execute any additional action for the ACL

00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079
additional action for the ACL

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.430
additional action for the ACL to

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440
to

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.950
to okay pro because it was set

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.990
who knows in any case I think it's fine

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000
who knows in any case I think it's fine

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.510
who knows in any case I think it's fine so in general I had no questions on this

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520
so in general I had no questions on this

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.790
so in general I had no questions on this except the question on

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800
except the question on

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.309
except the question on so there it says that to use it in the

00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319
so there it says that to use it in the

00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:41.829
so there it says that to use it in the twig I should use is granted view entity

00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839
twig I should use is granted view entity

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:44.309
twig I should use is granted view entity but it's actually view an entity. If I

00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319
but it's actually view an entity. If I

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:46.790
but it's actually view an entity. If I want to specify something specific like

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800
want to specify something specific like

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.069
want to specify something specific like my role for the action I should use uh

00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079
my role for the action I should use uh

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:52.470
my role for the action I should use uh then you just pass the ID of the rule.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480
then you just pass the ID of the rule.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.309
then you just pass the ID of the rule. Can you switch to the slide number? I

00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319
Can you switch to the slide number? I

00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:56.069
Can you switch to the slide number? I know probably

00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079
know probably

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:59.750
know probably lower lower

00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760
lower lower

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.030
lower lower where we have section for ACL lower

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040
where we have section for ACL lower

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.270
where we have section for ACL lower lower.

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280
lower.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.790
lower. Stop

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800

Lower. Lower. Lower.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.309
Lower. Lower. Lower. Still lower. I stopped you to too fast.

00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319
Still lower. I stopped you to too fast.

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:18.230
Still lower. I stopped you to too fast. Action permissions. This and the next

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240
Action permissions. This and the next

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.870
Action permissions. This and the next slide. How to define action permissions.

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880
slide. How to define action permissions.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.589
slide. How to define action permissions. Mhm.

00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599
Mhm.

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:24.630
Mhm. 23rd slide. Yeah.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640
23rd slide. Yeah.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.349
23rd slide. Yeah. How to check.

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359
How to check.

00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:26.470
How to check. Oh yeah. Right.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480
Oh yeah. Right.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.349
Oh yeah. Right. So here you just always pass the ID of

00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359
So here you just always pass the ID of

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:31.270
So here you just always pass the ID of your rule.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280
your rule.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.950
your rule. Okay.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960
Okay.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.030
Okay. So if you want to check entity

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040
So if you want to check entity

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.109
So if you want to check entity permission then you need to specify

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119
permission then you need to specify

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:39.030
permission then you need to specify which action on which entity. So for

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040
which action on which entity. So for

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.870
which action on which entity. So for example view action on some particular

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880
example view action on some particular

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.030
example view action on some particular entity and if you want to check this

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040
entity and if you want to check this

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.190
entity and if you want to check this action rule then just the identifier

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200
action rule then just the identifier

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.390
action rule then just the identifier okay and for the

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400
okay and for the

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.990
okay and for the this ACL rules could always

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000
this ACL rules could always

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.670
this ACL rules could always it's always the fire to the ACL from

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680
it's always the fire to the ACL from

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.190
it's always the fire to the ACL from there

00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200
there

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.349
there from here or from controller because in

00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359
from here or from controller because in

00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:03.510
from here or from controller because in controller in the ACL annotation you

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520
controller in the ACL annotation you

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.910
controller in the ACL annotation you also specify you also create and uh

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920
also specify you also create and uh

Okay, in general it's pretty much clear. However, I was not able to test because

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640
However, I was not able to test because

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.349
However, I was not able to test because I was tried to create the new

some link with confirmation of the email, but I'm not sure

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480
email, but I'm not sure

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:54.230
email, but I'm not sure why it's still asking for this.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.950
You can always

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960
You can always

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.990
You can always create user from the CLI if you prefer.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000
create user from the CLI if you prefer.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.630
create user from the CLI if you prefer. I can reset password probably, but I'm

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640
I can reset password probably, but I'm

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.390
I can reset password probably, but I'm not sure. So, it will send the email.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400
not sure. So, it will send the email.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.109
not sure. So, it will send the email. But how did you create the user via the

00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119
But how did you create the user via the

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:11.589
But how did you create the user via the UI

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599
UI

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:13.510
UI from the admin panel? Yeah, from you are

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520
from the admin panel? Yeah, from you are

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.670
from the admin panel? Yeah, from you are in admin panel.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.750
H

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760
H

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.670
H why it's asking you for

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680
why it's asking you for

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.430
why it's asking you for okay still you can test it on your

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440
okay still you can test it on your

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.950
okay still you can test it on your admin. He has a role administrator. So

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960
admin. He has a role administrator. So

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.990
admin. He has a role administrator. So you can just edit administrator role and

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000
you can just edit administrator role and

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.510
you can just edit administrator role and play around with it there.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520
play around with it there.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.430
play around with it there. Okay, in any case that's something I

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440
Okay, in any case that's something I

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.750
Okay, in any case that's something I need to figure out why it's not working

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760
need to figure out why it's not working

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.630
need to figure out why it's not working and yeah and with other stuff it seems

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640
and yeah and with other stuff it seems

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:52.069
and yeah and with other stuff it seems that I have created the ECL from the top

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:54.630
so we can continue. It's already one and

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640
so we can continue. It's already one and

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.470
so we can continue. It's already one and a half hour I believe we start.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480
a half hour I believe we start.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.870
a half hour I believe we start. Yeah.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880
Yeah.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.270
Yeah. Uh okay. So since you all have

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280
Uh okay. So since you all have

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.309
Uh okay. So since you all have everything so I will not show you the

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319
everything so I will not show you the

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:07.990
everything so I will not show you the solution because you have solution on

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000
solution because you have solution on

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.710
solution because you have solution on your side.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720
your side.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.829
your side. Yeah guys do you want to break get up

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839
Yeah guys do you want to break get up

00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:17.829
Yeah guys do you want to break get up from the computer grab something

00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839
from the computer grab something

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.670
from the computer grab something right knife.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680
right knife.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.069
right knife. Okay. Yeah. So let's meet back

Okay, guys. Please let me know if you're here.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:11.430
Victor Alant, are you here?

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440
Victor Alant, are you here?

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:18.630
Victor Alant, are you here? Okay.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.870
Okay. So I'll start slowly. Uh so the

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880
Okay. So I'll start slowly. Uh so the

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.710
Okay. So I'll start slowly. Uh so the topic for today it's going to be about

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720
topic for today it's going to be about

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.069
topic for today it's going to be about uh import and export of entities and I

00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079
uh import and export of entities and I

00:56:30.079 --> 00:56:33.030
uh import and export of entities and I will show you the whole idea how this is

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040
will show you the whole idea how this is

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.549
will show you the whole idea how this is uh

00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559
uh

00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:39.190
uh um implemented what parts it has and I

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200
um implemented what parts it has and I

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.150
um implemented what parts it has and I will also uh show you in the meantime

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160
will also uh show you in the meantime

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.309
will also uh show you in the meantime how to register what services to

00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319
how to register what services to

00:56:44.319 --> 00:56:46.870
how to register what services to register to create import export because

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880
register to create import export because

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.470
register to create import export because during the practice session we're going

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480
during the practice session we're going

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.549
during the practice session we're going to create a very simple import export

00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559
to create a very simple import export

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:55.190
to create a very simple import export for our usernaming type uh entity and

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200
for our usernaming type uh entity and

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.950
for our usernaming type uh entity and why I'm saying very simple because we

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960
why I'm saying very simple because we

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.870
why I'm saying very simple because we will just create the one that it's like

00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880
will just create the one that it's like

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.710
will just create the one that it's like out of the box. So you will need to

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720
out of the box. So you will need to

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.430
out of the box. So you will need to register some services but there will be

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440
register some services but there will be

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.150
register some services but there will be almost no PHP coding because we'll use

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160
almost no PHP coding because we'll use

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.109
almost no PHP coding because we'll use our uh default uh PHP services for it

00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119
our uh default uh PHP services for it

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:15.430
our uh default uh PHP services for it that sits in our core bundles.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.430
Uh

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440
Uh

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.430
Uh okay.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:27.510
Uh okay. So uh in general uh we use uh

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520
Uh okay. So uh in general uh we use uh

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.710
Uh okay. So uh in general uh we use uh Oro bundle every part of it it's uh in

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720
Oro bundle every part of it it's uh in

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.190
Oro bundle every part of it it's uh in orbatch bundle and part it's inside

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200
orbatch bundle and part it's inside

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.670
orbatch bundle and part it's inside import export bundle.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680
import export bundle.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.510
import export bundle. Uh and basically we were inspired by a

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520
Uh and basically we were inspired by a

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.150
Uh and basically we were inspired by a nail batch bundle and sprig batch. Uh

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160
nail batch bundle and sprig batch. Uh

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.430
nail batch bundle and sprig batch. Uh and basically we have this

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440
and basically we have this

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.829
and basically we have this exact same uh idea that we have here. So

00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839
exact same uh idea that we have here. So

00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:52.710
exact same uh idea that we have here. So we have a job launcher that launches a

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720
we have a job launcher that launches a

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.630
we have a job launcher that launches a job which is for example import or

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640
job which is for example import or

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.030
job which is for example import or export. Uh then this job is uh can have

00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040
export. Uh then this job is uh can have

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.349
export. Uh then this job is uh can have multiple steps. Actually for our import

00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359
multiple steps. Actually for our import

00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:03.670
multiple steps. Actually for our import is just one step which is importing and

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680
is just one step which is importing and

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.789
is just one step which is importing and for export is export step but job can

00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799
for export is export step but job can

00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:09.430
for export is export step but job can have multiple steps and then each step

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440
have multiple steps and then each step

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.990
have multiple steps and then each step is divided in three parts. First we have

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000
is divided in three parts. First we have

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.990
is divided in three parts. First we have reader, then we have processor and then

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000
reader, then we have processor and then

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.670
reader, then we have processor and then we have writer. So basically uh the same

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680
we have writer. So basically uh the same

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.390
we have writer. So basically uh the same idea is implemented on our site. Uh so

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400
idea is implemented on our site. Uh so

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.630
idea is implemented on our site. Uh so it works as synchronously. So when you

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640
it works as synchronously. So when you

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.789
it works as synchronously. So when you import the CSV file with some entities,

00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799
import the CSV file with some entities,

00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:29.430
import the CSV file with some entities, it will be pushed to message Q and

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440
it will be pushed to message Q and

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.190
it will be pushed to message Q and consumer will execute appropriate

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200
consumer will execute appropriate

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.750
consumer will execute appropriate processes to do the import or export.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760
processes to do the import or export.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.670
processes to do the import or export. And if the file is big, it will be

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680
And if the file is big, it will be

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.990
And if the file is big, it will be divided in batches and those batches

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000
divided in batches and those batches

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.270
divided in batches and those batches will be executed uh can be executed in

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280
will be executed uh can be executed in

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.270
will be executed uh can be executed in parallel right you need to have multiple

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280
parallel right you need to have multiple

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.109
parallel right you need to have multiple consumers because if you have one then

00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119
consumers because if you have one then

00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:48.309
consumers because if you have one then still it will execute this batch by

00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319
still it will execute this batch by

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:50.710
still it will execute this batch by batch but if you have multiple then it

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720
batch but if you have multiple then it

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.309
batch but if you have multiple then it can be executed in parallel. Uh and also

00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319
can be executed in parallel. Uh and also

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:56.309
can be executed in parallel. Uh and also import export is very often used by

00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319
import export is very often used by

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:58.390
import export is very often used by integration with data sync. So if you

00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400
integration with data sync. So if you

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.789
integration with data sync. So if you have integration that is syncing data

00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799
have integration that is syncing data

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:02.390
have integration that is syncing data between Oro and some third party

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400
between Oro and some third party

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.150
between Oro and some third party application uh we also use import export

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160
application uh we also use import export

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.390
application uh we also use import export uh functionality in this particular

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400
uh functionality in this particular

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.950
uh functionality in this particular case.

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960
case.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:14.150
case. Uh so what about those jobs? Uh so the

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160
Uh so what about those jobs? Uh so the

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.069
Uh so what about those jobs? Uh so the jobs are basically used to trigger

00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079
jobs are basically used to trigger

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:19.510
jobs are basically used to trigger import and export. Uh and for most of

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520
import and export. Uh and for most of

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.150
import and export. Uh and for most of the entities we will use jobs defined in

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160
the entities we will use jobs defined in

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.309
the entities we will use jobs defined in Oro import export bundle. So there are

00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319
Oro import export bundle. So there are

00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:26.789
Oro import export bundle. So there are already some jobs defined for import

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799
already some jobs defined for import

00:59:26.799 --> 00:59:29.670
already some jobs defined for import export uh import validate and export

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680
export uh import validate and export

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.430
export uh import validate and export template and I will show you them in a

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440
template and I will show you them in a

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.109
template and I will show you them in a second. Uh and uh we will basically

00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119
second. Uh and uh we will basically

00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:37.750
second. Uh and uh we will basically reuse them in the practice session. We

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760
reuse them in the practice session. We

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.710
reuse them in the practice session. We will also reuse them. Uh the only

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720
will also reuse them. Uh the only

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.549
will also reuse them. Uh the only situation that I see that you would like

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559
situation that I see that you would like

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:45.109
situation that I see that you would like to create a different job is when you

00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119
to create a different job is when you

00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:46.710
to create a different job is when you would like to have for example some

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720
would like to have for example some

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.109
would like to have for example some custom processor.

00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119
custom processor.

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.829
custom processor. Uh and this job always has three parts

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839
Uh and this job always has three parts

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:55.109
Uh and this job always has three parts reader, processor and writer. And the

00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119
reader, processor and writer. And the

00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:58.069
reader, processor and writer. And the jobs are defined inside the budge job yl

00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079
jobs are defined inside the budge job yl

00:59:58.079 --> 01:00:01.270
jobs are defined inside the budge job yl file which is then used by our import

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280
file which is then used by our import

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.470
file which is then used by our import export bundle. And

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480
export bundle. And

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.630
export bundle. And this bundle is parsing this file

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640
this bundle is parsing this file

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.390
this bundle is parsing this file registering the jobs.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.870
So how does default jobs work? Uh so we

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880
So how does default jobs work? Uh so we

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.390
So how does default jobs work? Uh so we have

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400
have

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.670
have job export to CSV, export template,

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680
job export to CSV, export template,

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.750
job export to CSV, export template, import validation and import from CSV.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760
import validation and import from CSV.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.030
import validation and import from CSV. Those jobs are and we have also uh for

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040
Those jobs are and we have also uh for

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.910
Those jobs are and we have also uh for XLSX but mostly we use uh CSV here and

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920
XLSX but mostly we use uh CSV here and

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.589
XLSX but mostly we use uh CSV here and this strictly goes to uh the import

01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599
this strictly goes to uh the import

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:38.069
this strictly goes to uh the import export that we see in many places. Let

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079
export that we see in many places. Let

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:41.829
export that we see in many places. Let me go to for example contacts

01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839
me go to for example contacts

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.750
me go to for example contacts and here we have those buttons.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760
and here we have those buttons.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.309
and here we have those buttons. Basically in oro import export is

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319
Basically in oro import export is

01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:48.309
Basically in oro import export is usually available from the index page

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319
usually available from the index page

01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:50.230
usually available from the index page which makes sense because we have list

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240
which makes sense because we have list

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.470
which makes sense because we have list of contacts. So we can now export

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480
of contacts. So we can now export

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.270
of contacts. So we can now export contacts and import contacts and those

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280
contacts and import contacts and those

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.150
contacts and import contacts and those four jobs goes to the buttons. So export

01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160
four jobs goes to the buttons. So export

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.589
four jobs goes to the buttons. So export job this is this one. Uh then inside the

01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599
job this is this one. Uh then inside the

01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:05.349
job this is this one. Uh then inside the import if I open it I can import. So

01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359
import if I open it I can import. So

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:08.470
import if I open it I can import. So basically select a file

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480
basically select a file

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.750
basically select a file and uh import it. But import validate

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760
and uh import it. But import validate

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.910
and uh import it. But import validate job goes to this button. So basically I

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920
job goes to this button. So basically I

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.270
job goes to this button. So basically I can uh just validate the file. So do

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280
can uh just validate the file. So do

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.549
can uh just validate the file. So do everything except saving this uh import

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559
everything except saving this uh import

01:01:20.559 --> 01:01:22.309
everything except saving this uh import to database.

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319
to database.

01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:24.390
to database. Uh and also sometimes you have this

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400
Uh and also sometimes you have this

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.230
Uh and also sometimes you have this additional button to download a

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240
additional button to download a

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.069
additional button to download a template. Okay. Uh so you can download

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079
template. Okay. Uh so you can download

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:34.390
template. Okay. Uh so you can download uh CSV file with heathers and some dummy

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400
uh CSV file with heathers and some dummy

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.390
uh CSV file with heathers and some dummy data in one row. So basically the

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400
data in one row. So basically the

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.309
data in one row. So basically the template for our import. So we have one

01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319
template for our import. So we have one

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:46.470
template for our import. So we have one two three and four and this directly

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480
two three and four and this directly

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.109
two three and four and this directly goes to export

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119
goes to export

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:52.309
goes to export is this job is triggered by export

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319
is this job is triggered by export

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:56.470
is this job is triggered by export button. Export template is triggered by

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480
button. Export template is triggered by

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.750
button. Export template is triggered by uh this button. Then we have import

01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760
uh this button. Then we have import

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.390
uh this button. Then we have import validate

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400
validate

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.109
validate and import.

01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119
and import.

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:09.109
and import. And they all have only one step.

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119
And they all have only one step.

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.670
And they all have only one step. So our jobs have only one step. There's

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680
So our jobs have only one step. There's

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.309
So our jobs have only one step. There's no need for anything else. But in case

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319
no need for anything else. But in case

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:16.789
no need for anything else. But in case you can create multiple steps in some

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799
you can create multiple steps in some

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.910
you can create multiple steps in some customizations then

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920
customizations then

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.069
customizations then uh they all consist of three elements.

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079
uh they all consist of three elements.

01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:24.549
uh they all consist of three elements. read their processor and writer. So

01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559
read their processor and writer. So

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:27.190
read their processor and writer. So basically also the name of services

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200
basically also the name of services

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.190
basically also the name of services because behind this this is basically a

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200
because behind this this is basically a

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.589
because behind this this is basically a service. So there is a PHP class behind

01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599
service. So there is a PHP class behind

01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:34.549
service. So there is a PHP class behind this. Uh and the name of services can

01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559
this. Uh and the name of services can

01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:37.270
this. Uh and the name of services can also tell us something. So for the

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280
also tell us something. So for the

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.510
also tell us something. So for the export we're reading entities from

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520
export we're reading entities from

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.470
export we're reading entities from database writing to CSV.

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480
database writing to CSV.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.589
database writing to CSV. Uh from template we're reading data from

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599
Uh from template we're reading data from

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.990
Uh from template we're reading data from the some template. So demo data writing

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000
the some template. So demo data writing

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.710
the some template. So demo data writing to CSV. For import validation, we'll

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720
to CSV. For import validation, we'll

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.030
to CSV. For import validation, we'll reading from CSV file, but basically

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040
reading from CSV file, but basically

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.349
reading from CSV file, but basically writing to null because we are just

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359
writing to null because we are just

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:58.150
writing to null because we are just doing the validation. And for the

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160
doing the validation. And for the

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.270
doing the validation. And for the import, we're reading from CSV file and

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280
import, we're reading from CSV file and

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.309
import, we're reading from CSV file and uh writing to the database.

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319
uh writing to the database.

01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:06.710
uh writing to the database. And then for each we have a default

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720
And then for each we have a default

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.430
And then for each we have a default processor that it's that has all the

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440
processor that it's that has all the

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.789
processor that it's that has all the implementation that you need in uh of

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799
implementation that you need in uh of

01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:14.150
implementation that you need in uh of course if you need to do something

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160
course if you need to do something

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.670
course if you need to do something custom

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680
custom

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.510
custom uh then

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520
uh then

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.910
uh then you can implement your own processor but

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920
you can implement your own processor but

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.750
you can implement your own processor but if not

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760
if not

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.309
if not we'll be using actually this one. So we

01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319
we'll be using actually this one. So we

01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:28.309
we'll be using actually this one. So we will reuse uh those jobs. So after we

01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319
will reuse uh those jobs. So after we

01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:30.309
will reuse uh those jobs. So after we will create import export we will also

01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319
will create import export we will also

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:32.950
will create import export we will also add buttons like those one and those

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960
add buttons like those one and those

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.950
add buttons like those one and those buttons will be the default buttons that

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960
buttons will be the default buttons that

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.029
buttons will be the default buttons that will trigger uh those jobs.

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:45.029
Okay. And uh in case you wonder which

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039
Okay. And uh in case you wonder which

01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:48.710
Okay. And uh in case you wonder which service is represing

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.309
steps

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319
steps

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:54.309
steps uh so yes here in the steps definition

01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319
uh so yes here in the steps definition

01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:57.670
uh so yes here in the steps definition we also define a class for the step and

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680
we also define a class for the step and

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.910
we also define a class for the step and you can have multiple steps. So

01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920
you can have multiple steps. So

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.069
you can have multiple steps. So basically we also have a service that

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079
basically we also have a service that

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:06.710
basically we also have a service that executes uh steps one after the other.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720
executes uh steps one after the other.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.950
executes uh steps one after the other. So in general our job has reader,

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960
So in general our job has reader,

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.750
So in general our job has reader, processor and writer. Reader only reads

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760
processor and writer. Reader only reads

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.109
processor and writer. Reader only reads data uh from data source in our case in

01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119
data uh from data source in our case in

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:20.470
data uh from data source in our case in my example is CSV file or database and

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480
my example is CSV file or database and

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.270
my example is CSV file or database and then returns data row at one one row at

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280
then returns data row at one one row at

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.990
then returns data row at one one row at a time and processor does all the magic

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000
a time and processor does all the magic

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.390
a time and processor does all the magic all the job and then we have writer that

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400
all the job and then we have writer that

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.510
all the job and then we have writer that writes uh those data either to database

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520
writes uh those data either to database

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.470
writes uh those data either to database or CSV file. Uh so as you can see we

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480
or CSV file. Uh so as you can see we

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.870
or CSV file. Uh so as you can see we have strict division of responsibility.

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880
have strict division of responsibility.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.150
have strict division of responsibility. So no processing in reader or writing a

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160
So no processing in reader or writing a

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.870
So no processing in reader or writing a writer only in processor.

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880
writer only in processor.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.950
writer only in processor. Um

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960
Um

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.630
Um yeah.

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640
yeah.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.829
yeah. Uh so then how to register uh this

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839
Uh so then how to register uh this

01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:52.069
Uh so then how to register uh this processor?

01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079
processor?

01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:54.710
processor? Uh so processor will basically do

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720
Uh so processor will basically do

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.150
Uh so processor will basically do everything right? It's between the

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160
everything right? It's between the

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.150
everything right? It's between the reader and writer. So everything that

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160
reader and writer. So everything that

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.510
reader and writer. So everything that happens uh will be inside processor. And

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520
happens uh will be inside processor. And

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.549
happens uh will be inside processor. And processor is basically a service uh and

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559
processor is basically a service uh and

01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:06.789
processor is basically a service uh and for it to be recognized as a processor

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799
for it to be recognized as a processor

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:10.309
for it to be recognized as a processor we need to register it and add a DI

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319
we need to register it and add a DI

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:13.990
we need to register it and add a DI container tag or import export processor

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000
container tag or import export processor

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.390
container tag or import export processor and our processor before I will show you

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400
and our processor before I will show you

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.630
and our processor before I will show you the definition of processor. You need to

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640
the definition of processor. You need to

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.029
the definition of processor. You need to also know that processor is also divided

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039
also know that processor is also divided

01:05:21.039 --> 01:05:25.990
also know that processor is also divided in three parts. Um actually for import

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000
in three parts. Um actually for import

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.710
in three parts. Um actually for import we have all three parts. For export we

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720
we have all three parts. For export we

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.430
we have all three parts. For export we don't have strategy. Why? I will explain

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440
don't have strategy. Why? I will explain

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.270
don't have strategy. Why? I will explain in a moment. Uh so we have data

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280
in a moment. Uh so we have data

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.270
in a moment. Uh so we have data converter

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280
converter

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.910
converter and this data converter is uh

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920
and this data converter is uh

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.549
and this data converter is uh responsible for uh converting a heater

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559
responsible for uh converting a heater

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:48.309
responsible for uh converting a heater from our file to a complex array. Okay.

01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319
from our file to a complex array. Okay.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:51.029
from our file to a complex array. Okay. So just by the heaters it knows what

01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039
So just by the heaters it knows what

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:54.069
So just by the heaters it knows what sits inside each column. And in CSV

01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079
sits inside each column. And in CSV

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:56.549
sits inside each column. And in CSV file, the row is flat. And the data

01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559
file, the row is flat. And the data

01:05:56.559 --> 01:05:59.029
file, the row is flat. And the data converter knows how to create from this

01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039
converter knows how to create from this

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:02.470
converter knows how to create from this flat row a multi-dimensional array that

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480
flat row a multi-dimensional array that

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.870
flat row a multi-dimensional array that represents our entity. So our entity has

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880
represents our entity. So our entity has

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.789
represents our entity. So our entity has fields but also relations. So this will

01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799
fields but also relations. So this will

01:06:06.799 --> 01:06:09.910
fields but also relations. So this will be array of arrays and so on. And data

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920
be array of arrays and so on. And data

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.190
be array of arrays and so on. And data conventor knows how to do all this.

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200
conventor knows how to do all this.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.390
conventor knows how to do all this. Uh so by default uh we have a default

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400
Uh so by default uh we have a default

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.309
Uh so by default uh we have a default data converter that you can use. You

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319
data converter that you can use. You

01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:22.549
data converter that you can use. You don't need to create a custom one. And

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559
don't need to create a custom one. And

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:24.630
don't need to create a custom one. And this is the one and basically data

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640
this is the one and basically data

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.990
this is the one and basically data converter knows how to convert to import

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000
converter knows how to convert to import

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.789
converter knows how to convert to import and export format.

01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799
and export format.

01:06:30.799 --> 01:06:35.270
and export format. Uh and uh it has all the

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280
Uh and uh it has all the

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.829
Uh and uh it has all the information and it also parses our heer

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839
information and it also parses our heer

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:43.190
information and it also parses our heer um because by the heer by column names

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200
um because by the heer by column names

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.190
um because by the heer by column names you can specify

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200
you can specify

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.430
you can specify um what values are inside. So in case

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440
um what values are inside. So in case

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.670
um what values are inside. So in case you need to change this then you can

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680
you need to change this then you can

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.670
you need to change this then you can create your custom data converter that

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680
create your custom data converter that

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.150
create your custom data converter that will extend from this abstract table

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160
will extend from this abstract table

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.950
will extend from this abstract table data converter and your custom data

01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960
data converter and your custom data

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.390
data converter and your custom data converter for example can uh change

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400
converter for example can uh change

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.470
converter for example can uh change those heater conversion rules right so

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480
those heater conversion rules right so

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.390
those heater conversion rules right so this will be the name of our heer in

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400
this will be the name of our heer in

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.270
this will be the name of our heer in file and you can define that this will

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280
file and you can define that this will

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.390
file and you can define that this will go uh this to the sku field on our

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400
go uh this to the sku field on our

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.549
go uh this to the sku field on our product but this will go to the

01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559
product but this will go to the

01:07:14.559 --> 01:07:17.109
product but this will go to the inventory status which is unknown field.

01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119
inventory status which is unknown field.

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:19.029
inventory status which is unknown field. Uh so this is how you can change

01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039
Uh so this is how you can change

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:21.190
Uh so this is how you can change conversion conversion rules for the

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200
conversion conversion rules for the

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.069
conversion conversion rules for the heater for example. Uh so in this

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079
heater for example. Uh so in this

01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:27.349
heater for example. Uh so in this example we're just doing this that's why

01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359
example we're just doing this that's why

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:29.349
example we're just doing this that's why we created custom data converter that

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359
we created custom data converter that

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:32.390
we created custom data converter that extends from the default one

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400
extends from the default one

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.630
extends from the default one and we need to register it in a DI

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640
and we need to register it in a DI

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.150
and we need to register it in a DI container

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160
container

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.190
container and this is example of a definition. So

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200
and this is example of a definition. So

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.190
and this is example of a definition. So we are registering our service that is

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200
we are registering our service that is

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.589
we are registering our service that is extending from parent the default one

01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599
extending from parent the default one

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.630
extending from parent the default one from oruro import import export bundle

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640
from oruro import import export bundle

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.510
from oruro import import export bundle and because we have some custom

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520
and because we have some custom

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.230
and because we have some custom implementation here we also specify that

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240
implementation here we also specify that

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.470
implementation here we also specify that implementation is in our custom class.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:07.109
Okay. Then when a data converter does uh

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119
Okay. Then when a data converter does uh

01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:09.510
Okay. Then when a data converter does uh his job,

01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520
his job,

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.710
his job, we push everything to normalizers.

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720
we push everything to normalizers.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.470
we push everything to normalizers. So normalizer is responsible uh for

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480
So normalizer is responsible uh for

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.789
So normalizer is responsible uh for creating converting entity

01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799
creating converting entity

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:24.149
creating converting entity to an array and array to the entity to

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159
to an array and array to the entity to

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:29.349
to an array and array to the entity to the object. Uh so basically we have for

01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359
the object. Uh so basically we have for

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.430
the object. Uh so basically we have for example from data converter we get a

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440
example from data converter we get a

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.630
example from data converter we get a multi-dimensional array and uh

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640
multi-dimensional array and uh

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.149
multi-dimensional array and uh our normalizer the normalized it to an

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159
our normalizer the normalized it to an

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.829
our normalizer the normalized it to an object.

01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839
object.

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:44.950
object. So we have default stalizer for that.

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960
So we have default stalizer for that.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.070
So we have default stalizer for that. This this is this guy and you can also

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080
This this is this guy and you can also

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.349
This this is this guy and you can also use it as is and it's just basically the

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359
use it as is and it's just basically the

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.070
use it as is and it's just basically the normalizes and

01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080
normalizes and

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.189
normalizes and knows how to denormalize and normalize

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199
knows how to denormalize and normalize

01:08:57.199 --> 01:09:01.269
knows how to denormalize and normalize um our data. So it has information about

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279
um our data. So it has information about

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:04.630
um our data. So it has information about uh metadata on an entity and it knows

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640
uh metadata on an entity and it knows

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.590
uh metadata on an entity and it knows exactly how to create uh objects from

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600
exactly how to create uh objects from

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.590
exactly how to create uh objects from multi-dimensional array and

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600
multi-dimensional array and

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.470
multi-dimensional array and multi-dimensional array from an object

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480
multi-dimensional array from an object

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.829
multi-dimensional array from an object like basically normalizers do.

01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839
like basically normalizers do.

01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:22.470
like basically normalizers do. Uh and if you'd like to

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.269
implement custom one then you can of

01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279
implement custom one then you can of

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.269
implement custom one then you can of course do it. So you need to create a

01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279
course do it. So you need to create a

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.430
course do it. So you need to create a PHP class

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440
PHP class

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.829
PHP class and then uh it extends this default one

01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839
and then uh it extends this default one

01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:36.229
and then uh it extends this default one uh and by default it will be taken for

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239
uh and by default it will be taken for

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.669
uh and by default it will be taken for all the entities. So if you want to

01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679
all the entities. So if you want to

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:42.470
all the entities. So if you want to specify only some particular entity for

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480
specify only some particular entity for

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.229
specify only some particular entity for example for normalization then uh we

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239
example for normalization then uh we

01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:48.229
example for normalization then uh we have the support normal normalization

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239
have the support normal normalization

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:51.430
have the support normal normalization method and you just specify that okay

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440
method and you just specify that okay

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.310
method and you just specify that okay this will be only for the contact entity

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320
this will be only for the contact entity

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.669
this will be only for the contact entity and inside uh basically for normalize

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679
and inside uh basically for normalize

01:09:57.679 --> 01:09:59.669
and inside uh basically for normalize we're calling parent and then adding

01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679
we're calling parent and then adding

01:09:59.679 --> 01:10:03.030
we're calling parent and then adding some additional uh elements to the array

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040
some additional uh elements to the array

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.510
some additional uh elements to the array for the normalize the other way around.

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520
for the normalize the other way around.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.750
for the normalize the other way around. So first we're changing something and

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760
So first we're changing something and

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.630
So first we're changing something and then calling parent.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640
then calling parent.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.390
then calling parent. So first we're changing the array and

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400
So first we're changing the array and

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.310
So first we're changing the array and then calling parent to create object

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320
then calling parent to create object

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.950
then calling parent to create object from it.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.229
Okay. Uh in case you want to some

01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239
Okay. Uh in case you want to some

01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:24.470
Okay. Uh in case you want to some additional information

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480
additional information

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.630
additional information I've also given a link to symphonic

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640
I've also given a link to symphonic

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.590
I've also given a link to symphonic serializer because the idea it's here

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600
serializer because the idea it's here

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.550
serializer because the idea it's here the same. Uh so we have normalizers and

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560
the same. Uh so we have normalizers and

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.350
the same. Uh so we have normalizers and then we have encoders. In our case

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360
then we have encoders. In our case

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.149
then we have encoders. In our case normalizers are normalizers and encoders

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159
normalizers are normalizers and encoders

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:43.350
normalizers are normalizers and encoders this is uh this is my uh data converter.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360
this is uh this is my uh data converter.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.030
this is uh this is my uh data converter. So it converts data to some particular

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040
So it converts data to some particular

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.790
So it converts data to some particular um here will be data converter to array

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800
um here will be data converter to array

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:58.149
um here will be data converter to array and then to CSV file.

01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:01.750
Okay. So so far let's take the import

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760
Okay. So so far let's take the import

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.950
Okay. So so far let's take the import example. Data converter took the CSV

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960
example. Data converter took the CSV

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.669
example. Data converter took the CSV file. One row knows how to create

01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679
file. One row knows how to create

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:10.390
file. One row knows how to create multi-dimensional array from this row.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400
multi-dimensional array from this row.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.149
multi-dimensional array from this row. Then normalizer from the

01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159
Then normalizer from the

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:14.310
Then normalizer from the multi-dimensional array created an

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320
multi-dimensional array created an

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.950
multi-dimensional array created an object for us and then this object is

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960
object for us and then this object is

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.470
object for us and then this object is passed to strategy and here strategy is

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480
passed to strategy and here strategy is

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.709
passed to strategy and here strategy is responsible for

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719
responsible for

01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:26.229
responsible for um all the logic while processing. So

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239
um all the logic while processing. So

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:28.950
um all the logic while processing. So here you can do any customization you

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960
here you can do any customization you

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.669
here you can do any customization you need. Uh but most of all it's

01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679
need. Uh but most of all it's

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:34.550
need. Uh but most of all it's responsible for checking uh if this

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560
responsible for checking uh if this

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.350
responsible for checking uh if this record should be inserted to database or

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360
record should be inserted to database or

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.990
record should be inserted to database or maybe there is a similar record there

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000
maybe there is a similar record there

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.189
maybe there is a similar record there and it should be an update or maybe you

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199
and it should be an update or maybe you

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:46.149
and it should be an update or maybe you want to delete and then add. So strategy

01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159
want to delete and then add. So strategy

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:48.470
want to delete and then add. So strategy you can have multiple strategies and

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480
you can have multiple strategies and

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.430
you can have multiple strategies and strategy can be default one is add or

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440
strategy can be default one is add or

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.110
strategy can be default one is add or replace. So implementation of this class

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120
replace. So implementation of this class

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.430
replace. So implementation of this class will try to find the duplicate in the

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440
will try to find the duplicate in the

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.630
will try to find the duplicate in the database and if the duplicate exists

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640
database and if the duplicate exists

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.630
database and if the duplicate exists record will be updated if it doesn't

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640
record will be updated if it doesn't

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.350
record will be updated if it doesn't exist records will be inserted. Uh but

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360
exist records will be inserted. Uh but

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.149
exist records will be inserted. Uh but we can have also other strategies. Uh

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159
we can have also other strategies. Uh

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:09.910
we can have also other strategies. Uh for example if you define multiple

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920
for example if you define multiple

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.590
for example if you define multiple strategies uh for one import then here

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600
strategies uh for one import then here

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.430
strategies uh for one import then here like for the contact import we will have

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440
like for the contact import we will have

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.270
like for the contact import we will have this additional

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280
this additional

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.669
this additional drop list for the strategy. So we can

01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679
drop list for the strategy. So we can

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:25.669
drop list for the strategy. So we can add and replace but we can only add. So

01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679
add and replace but we can only add. So

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:29.030
add and replace but we can only add. So this will just

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040
this will just

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.470
this will just uh add all the records

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480
uh add all the records

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.750
uh add all the records um as is. Do not find the do not try to

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760
um as is. Do not find the do not try to

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.750
um as is. Do not find the do not try to find the duplicates. But if you have

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760
find the duplicates. But if you have

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.149
find the duplicates. But if you have only one strategy then basically this

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159
only one strategy then basically this

01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:44.310
only one strategy then basically this drop list will not even be here.

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320
drop list will not even be here.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:51.750
drop list will not even be here. Uh so let's say customers

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.990
So for for here we have only one

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000
So for for here we have only one

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.030
So for for here we have only one strategy to import customer. Uh so we

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040
strategy to import customer. Uh so we

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.470
strategy to import customer. Uh so we don't have a drop list to select the

01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480
don't have a drop list to select the

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.510
don't have a drop list to select the strategy. If we have multiple then there

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520
strategy. If we have multiple then there

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.350
strategy. If we have multiple then there will be this drop list

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.070
that is here.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080
that is here.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.229
that is here. Uh and the default strategy is

01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239
Uh and the default strategy is

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:13.110
Uh and the default strategy is configurable add or replace and it is

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120
configurable add or replace and it is

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.390
configurable add or replace and it is sufficient in most cases. uh and it is

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400
sufficient in most cases. uh and it is

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.270
sufficient in most cases. uh and it is basically uh trying to find duplicates

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280
basically uh trying to find duplicates

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.590
basically uh trying to find duplicates and by default it's going to find

01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600
and by default it's going to find

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.790
and by default it's going to find duplicates by identifier of our entity.

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800
duplicates by identifier of our entity.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.590
duplicates by identifier of our entity. So if you don't do anything for our

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600
So if you don't do anything for our

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.110
So if you don't do anything for our usernaming type this will be ID which is

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120
usernaming type this will be ID which is

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.950
usernaming type this will be ID which is primary key which doesn't make sense. So

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960
primary key which doesn't make sense. So

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.390
primary key which doesn't make sense. So um for example for customer user we also

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400
um for example for customer user we also

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.830
um for example for customer user we also don't want to find duplicates by ID.

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840
don't want to find duplicates by ID.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.149
don't want to find duplicates by ID. Preferably the best will be to do it by

01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159
Preferably the best will be to do it by

01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:49.030
Preferably the best will be to do it by username or by email. Email is unique.

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040
username or by email. Email is unique.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.550
username or by email. Email is unique. So maybe by email. So we have a way to

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560
So maybe by email. So we have a way to

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.350
So maybe by email. So we have a way to specify different identifier only for

01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360
specify different identifier only for

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.390
specify different identifier only for import export per entity.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400
import export per entity.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.630
import export per entity. Uh and if this different identifier is

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640
Uh and if this different identifier is

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.350
Uh and if this different identifier is specified, this strategy default one

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360
specified, this strategy default one

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.870
specified, this strategy default one configurable add or replace

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880
configurable add or replace

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.189
configurable add or replace is actually using this custom

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199
is actually using this custom

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:10.709
is actually using this custom identifier.

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719
identifier.

01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:12.550
identifier. And how to define this custom

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560
And how to define this custom

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.110
And how to define this custom identifier? I will show you in a moment.

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120
identifier? I will show you in a moment.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.110
identifier? I will show you in a moment. For now, just remember that our default

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120
For now, just remember that our default

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.110
For now, just remember that our default strategy is aware of this custom

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120
strategy is aware of this custom

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.030
strategy is aware of this custom identifier. It's and it's handling this.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040
identifier. It's and it's handling this.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.470
identifier. It's and it's handling this. If you'd like to create custom strategy,

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480
If you'd like to create custom strategy,

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.790
If you'd like to create custom strategy, you still can, right?

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800
you still can, right?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.669
you still can, right? So, you just need to create your class

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679
So, you just need to create your class

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:36.310
So, you just need to create your class that will extend for example from the

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320
that will extend for example from the

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.709
that will extend for example from the default one and do some additional

01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719
default one and do some additional

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:40.470
default one and do some additional stuff. So here we actually calling

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480
stuff. So here we actually calling

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.110
stuff. So here we actually calling parent but also additionally setting

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120
parent but also additionally setting

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:51.750
parent but also additionally setting relation in this case between

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.630
processing some contact fields if this

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640
processing some contact fields if this

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.950
processing some contact fields if this is an account so some custom thing and

01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960
is an account so some custom thing and

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.149
is an account so some custom thing and then you need to register it in the a

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159
then you need to register it in the a

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:05.750
then you need to register it in the a container. So your service that extends

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760
container. So your service that extends

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.950
container. So your service that extends from parent default one and it has some

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960
from parent default one and it has some

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.950
from parent default one and it has some custom implementation. So you need to

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960
custom implementation. So you need to

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.270
custom implementation. So you need to also specify the class with your custom

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280
also specify the class with your custom

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.189
also specify the class with your custom implementation.

01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:22.229
Uh okay

01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239
Uh okay

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.070
Uh okay the last part will be this import

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080
the last part will be this import

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.189
the last part will be this import template fixture. So to to be able to

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199
template fixture. So to to be able to

01:15:27.199 --> 01:15:30.390
template fixture. So to to be able to display and have this button here

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400
display and have this button here

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.669
display and have this button here so we can download some example a CSV

01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679
so we can download some example a CSV

01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:36.390
so we can download some example a CSV file with a heer and just first row of

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400
file with a heer and just first row of

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.990
file with a heer and just first row of filled with some dummy data. Uh we need

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000
filled with some dummy data. Uh we need

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.550
filled with some dummy data. Uh we need to actually

01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560
to actually

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.030
to actually uh create it. Uh so our template fixture

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040
uh create it. Uh so our template fixture

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.910
uh create it. Uh so our template fixture needs to extend abstract template

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920
needs to extend abstract template

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.709
needs to extend abstract template repository need to implement template

01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719
repository need to implement template

01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:55.110
repository need to implement template fixture interface and needs needs to be

01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120
fixture interface and needs needs to be

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.950
fixture interface and needs needs to be added in the DI container with

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960
added in the DI container with

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.510
added in the DI container with appropriate tag. Let's see some examples

01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520
appropriate tag. Let's see some examples

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.149
appropriate tag. Let's see some examples so it will be more clear

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159
so it will be more clear

01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:04.550
so it will be more clear um

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560
um

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.790
um how to implement

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800
how to implement

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.950
how to implement uh the template fixture. So for example

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960
uh the template fixture. So for example

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.950
uh the template fixture. So for example this one is for coupon. you will find

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960
this one is for coupon. you will find

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.910
this one is for coupon. you will find plenty of examples for other entities.

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920
plenty of examples for other entities.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.990
plenty of examples for other entities. So we are extending abstract template

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000
So we are extending abstract template

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.550
So we are extending abstract template repository from our import export bundle

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560
repository from our import export bundle

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.229
repository from our import export bundle and we need to implement template

01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239
and we need to implement template

01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:24.310
and we need to implement template fixture interface also from import

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320
fixture interface also from import

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.350
fixture interface also from import export bundle. Uh and then we need to

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360
export bundle. Uh and then we need to

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.750
export bundle. Uh and then we need to specify the parent class will do

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760
specify the parent class will do

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.910
specify the parent class will do almost all but we need to still fill

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920
almost all but we need to still fill

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.110
almost all but we need to still fill this with some dummy data. So the method

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120
this with some dummy data. So the method

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.590
this with some dummy data. So the method that we need to implement is uh what

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600
that we need to implement is uh what

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.470
that we need to implement is uh what entity to create says a coupon template

01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480
entity to create says a coupon template

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.430
entity to create says a coupon template fixture. So it's coupon uh the entity

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440
fixture. So it's coupon uh the entity

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.070
fixture. So it's coupon uh the entity class and then fill entity data.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080
class and then fill entity data.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.510
class and then fill entity data. Uh so we are just basically feing our

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520
Uh so we are just basically feing our

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.910
Uh so we are just basically feing our entity with some dummy data.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920
entity with some dummy data.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.990
entity with some dummy data. This state um uses per coupon. This is

01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000
This state um uses per coupon. This is

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.470
This state um uses per coupon. This is basically a coupon entity. So we need to

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480
basically a coupon entity. So we need to

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.790
basically a coupon entity. So we need to set some promotion, users per coupon,

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800
set some promotion, users per coupon,

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.910
set some promotion, users per coupon, user users per person, uh validation

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920
user users per person, uh validation

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.750
user users per person, uh validation dates and so on. And we're just

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760
dates and so on. And we're just

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.510
dates and so on. And we're just basically filling it with some dummy

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520
basically filling it with some dummy

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.030
basically filling it with some dummy data and that's it. Uh later in the get

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040
data and that's it. Uh later in the get

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.750
data and that's it. Uh later in the get data method, we will return this one

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760
data method, we will return this one

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.790
data method, we will return this one particular row by its identifier. That's

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800
particular row by its identifier. That's

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.510
particular row by its identifier. That's why we have here a switch and here we

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520
why we have here a switch and here we

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.990
why we have here a switch and here we are returning this particular element.

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000
are returning this particular element.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.510
are returning this particular element. Uh so basically this goes to this small

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.830
class

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840
class

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.870
class and it needs to be registered.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.030
It needs to be registered. This is

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040
It needs to be registered. This is

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.910
It needs to be registered. This is actually this part.

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920
actually this part.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.110
actually this part. Uh so this is my service name which has

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120
Uh so this is my service name which has

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.950
Uh so this is my service name which has implementation in this particular class

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960
implementation in this particular class

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.870
implementation in this particular class here

01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880
here

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.750
here and it is tagged with oro import export

01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760
and it is tagged with oro import export

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.110
and it is tagged with oro import export template fixture. Okay. And here I

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120
template fixture. Okay. And here I

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.430
template fixture. Okay. And here I highlighted everything because this

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440
highlighted everything because this

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.070
highlighted everything because this template fixture is not going to work on

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080
template fixture is not going to work on

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.669
template fixture is not going to work on its own. Uh you still need to create the

01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679
its own. Uh you still need to create the

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:17.669
its own. Uh you still need to create the export processor for it to work.

01:18:17.679 --> 01:18:21.430
Okay. So let's see finally the processor

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440
Okay. So let's see finally the processor

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.149
Okay. So let's see finally the processor definitions. Okay. So we know already

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159
definitions. Okay. So we know already

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:27.030
definitions. Okay. So we know already that we have import and export. We can

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040
that we have import and export. We can

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.510
that we have import and export. We can also do import validate and export this

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520
also do import validate and export this

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.310
also do import validate and export this template that we created here. And for

01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320
template that we created here. And for

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.669
template that we created here. And for all those four uh parts you need to have

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679
all those four uh parts you need to have

01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:38.630
all those four uh parts you need to have a processor. So we have four types of

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640
a processor. So we have four types of

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.550
a processor. So we have four types of processors. Import validation, import,

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560
processors. Import validation, import,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.270
processors. Import validation, import, export template and export.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280
export template and export.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.510
export template and export. And for example

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:55.350
uh this is for contact. Okay. So those

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.110
processors um we have two import

01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120
processors um we have two import

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.950
processors um we have two import processors and this is connected with

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960
processors and this is connected with

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.189
processors and this is connected with the fact that we have two strategies. So

01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199
the fact that we have two strategies. So

01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:05.270
the fact that we have two strategies. So we cannot have one processor with

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280
we cannot have one processor with

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.990
we cannot have one processor with multiple strategies that's why we we

01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000
multiple strategies that's why we we

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.070
multiple strategies that's why we we declared both and as you can see there

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080
declared both and as you can see there

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.070
declared both and as you can see there is no class anywhere here. So there's no

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080
is no class anywhere here. So there's no

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.590
is no class anywhere here. So there's no custom

01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600
custom

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.630
custom implementation for those processor

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640
implementation for those processor

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.709
implementation for those processor processors. We are just basically

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719
processors. We are just basically

01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:25.189
processors. We are just basically reusing parent class that sits in

01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199
reusing parent class that sits in

01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:29.270
reusing parent class that sits in autoimp import export bundle and um we

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280
autoimp import export bundle and um we

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.470
autoimp import export bundle and um we can use this uh symfony

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480
can use this uh symfony

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.590
can use this uh symfony um feature here that you don't need to

01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600
um feature here that you don't need to

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.229
um feature here that you don't need to create empty PHP class that will extend

01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239
create empty PHP class that will extend

01:19:38.239 --> 01:19:41.189
create empty PHP class that will extend from parent and basically

01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199
from parent and basically

01:19:41.199 --> 01:19:45.510
from parent and basically just be empty. Uh so here we just need

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520
just be empty. Uh so here we just need

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.709
just be empty. Uh so here we just need to register our service and this is our

01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719
to register our service and this is our

01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:54.870
to register our service and this is our custom service that extends from parent

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.430
and we don't need to specify any PHP

01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440
and we don't need to specify any PHP

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.149
and we don't need to specify any PHP code here. It will just in the

01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159
code here. It will just in the

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:03.350
code here. It will just in the background be the service that has

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360
background be the service that has

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.149
background be the service that has implementation in parent and do not have

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159
implementation in parent and do not have

01:20:06.159 --> 01:20:08.790
implementation in parent and do not have any custom

01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800
any custom

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.229
any custom PHP code. So everything will be taken

01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239
PHP code. So everything will be taken

01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:14.630
PHP code. So everything will be taken from our parent class

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640
from our parent class

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.709
from our parent class for the import processor. Um normalizers

01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719
for the import processor. Um normalizers

01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:22.390
for the import processor. Um normalizers are set uh by default normalizer is set

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400
are set uh by default normalizer is set

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.189
are set uh by default normalizer is set inside our parent classes. So you don't

01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199
inside our parent classes. So you don't

01:20:25.199 --> 01:20:28.229
inside our parent classes. So you don't need to bother about setting normalizer

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239
need to bother about setting normalizer

01:20:28.239 --> 01:20:32.470
need to bother about setting normalizer um until you don't have a custom one.

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480
um until you don't have a custom one.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.950
um until you don't have a custom one. uh you need to set a data converter for

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960
uh you need to set a data converter for

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.390
uh you need to set a data converter for our input processor and a strategy.

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400
our input processor and a strategy.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.950
our input processor and a strategy. Uh data converter first needs to be

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960
Uh data converter first needs to be

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.470
Uh data converter first needs to be created. So for the contact

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480
created. So for the contact

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.350
created. So for the contact it's here. As you can see here again we

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360
it's here. As you can see here again we

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.750
it's here. As you can see here again we don't have anything custom. So we don't

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760
don't have anything custom. So we don't

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.470
don't have anything custom. So we don't have PHP class behind this other than

01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480
have PHP class behind this other than

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.470
have PHP class behind this other than the uh parent one. Okay. So this is my

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480
the uh parent one. Okay. So this is my

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.189
the uh parent one. Okay. So this is my data converter that extends from parent

01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199
data converter that extends from parent

01:20:59.199 --> 01:21:01.510
data converter that extends from parent and I don't have any customization. So

01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520
and I don't have any customization. So

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.110
and I don't have any customization. So no PHP code no additional PHP code uh

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120
no PHP code no additional PHP code uh

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.510
no PHP code no additional PHP code uh behind this. Uh then strategy also needs

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520
behind this. Uh then strategy also needs

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.950
behind this. Uh then strategy also needs to be

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.830
uh defined. So this is my service. It

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840
uh defined. So this is my service. It

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.990
uh defined. So this is my service. It extends from parent the default one

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000
extends from parent the default one

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.390
extends from parent the default one configurable at or replace and that

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400
configurable at or replace and that

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.149
configurable at or replace and that would be sufficient. So the name of the

01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159
would be sufficient. So the name of the

01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:24.390
would be sufficient. So the name of the service and extending from parent but

01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400
service and extending from parent but

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.310
service and extending from parent but actually in this particular case we have

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320
actually in this particular case we have

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.229
actually in this particular case we have some customization.

01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239
some customization.

01:21:28.239 --> 01:21:31.830
some customization. Uh so we have class and some additional

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840
Uh so we have class and some additional

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.390
Uh so we have class and some additional methods inside but normally if you use

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400
methods inside but normally if you use

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.950
methods inside but normally if you use just the default

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960
just the default

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.510
just the default you need to register your ser service

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520
you need to register your ser service

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.270
you need to register your ser service and

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280
and

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.830
and say that it extends from parent default

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840
say that it extends from parent default

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.709
say that it extends from parent default configurable add or replace and then set

01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719
configurable add or replace and then set

01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:49.030
configurable add or replace and then set it in your processor.

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040
it in your processor.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.709
it in your processor. Uh then inside import processor uh we

01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719
Uh then inside import processor uh we

01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:55.270
Uh then inside import processor uh we need to tag it with oral import export

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280
need to tag it with oral import export

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.629
need to tag it with oral import export processor tag. This is why um this

01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639
processor tag. This is why um this

01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:01.270
processor tag. This is why um this particular service will be recognized as

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280
particular service will be recognized as

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.550
particular service will be recognized as an import export processor. Then we need

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560
an import export processor. Then we need

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.189
an import export processor. Then we need to pass the type. So this will going to

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199
to pass the type. So this will going to

01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:09.590
to pass the type. So this will going to be an import type

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600
be an import type

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.990
be an import type entity contact. So we're going to import

01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000
entity contact. So we're going to import

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.470
entity contact. So we're going to import contact entities and we also need to

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480
contact entities and we also need to

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.830
contact entities and we also need to give it some alias. Later on we will uh

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840
give it some alias. Later on we will uh

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:24.070
give it some alias. Later on we will uh use this alias for example to display um

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.870
to create configuration for the buttons.

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880
to create configuration for the buttons.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.590
to create configuration for the buttons. So it needs to have an alias. Then we

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600
So it needs to have an alias. Then we

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.709
So it needs to have an alias. Then we can reuse one processor for the

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719
can reuse one processor for the

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:35.350
can reuse one processor for the different type like import validation.

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360
different type like import validation.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.110
different type like import validation. Why? Because import and export

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120
Why? Because import and export

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.270
Why? Because import and export validation are doing exactly the same

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280
validation are doing exactly the same

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.270
validation are doing exactly the same job and they should do exactly the same

01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280
job and they should do exactly the same

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.750
job and they should do exactly the same job. The difference is in writer, right?

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760
job. The difference is in writer, right?

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.390
job. The difference is in writer, right? Because for import we are writing to

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400
Because for import we are writing to

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.709
Because for import we are writing to database for import validation we are

01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719
database for import validation we are

01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:52.229
database for import validation we are not writing anywhere but uh writer is

01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239
not writing anywhere but uh writer is

01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:54.390
not writing anywhere but uh writer is not part of the processor. So here we

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400
not part of the processor. So here we

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.149
not part of the processor. So here we actually can reuse it. That's why you

01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159
actually can reuse it. That's why you

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:58.790
actually can reuse it. That's why you see a second tag again this is a

01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800
see a second tag again this is a

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.350
see a second tag again this is a processor. So we have our import export

01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360
processor. So we have our import export

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.870
processor. So we have our import export processor tag type is import validation

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880
processor tag type is import validation

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.350
processor tag type is import validation which entity we want to import and we

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360
which entity we want to import and we

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.709
which entity we want to import and we need to give it some alias

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719
need to give it some alias

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.870
need to give it some alias because we have different strategy

01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880
because we have different strategy

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.550
because we have different strategy that's why we have second import

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560
that's why we have second import

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.870
that's why we have second import processor but as you can see it pretty

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880
processor but as you can see it pretty

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.910
processor but as you can see it pretty it's similar just strategy it's

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920
it's similar just strategy it's

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.910
it's similar just strategy it's different

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920
different

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.470
different than this one normally you will have

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480
than this one normally you will have

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.350
than this one normally you will have only one import processor

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360
only one import processor

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.510
only one import processor and for export

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520
and for export

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.510
and for export uh first is for the exporting only. So

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520
uh first is for the exporting only. So

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.990
uh first is for the exporting only. So it's this is the default parent

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000
it's this is the default parent

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.590
it's this is the default parent processor export abstract. Uh here we

01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600
processor export abstract. Uh here we

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.510
processor export abstract. Uh here we don't have a strategy because we're not

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520
don't have a strategy because we're not

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.550
don't have a strategy because we're not doing anything with the data other than

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560
doing anything with the data other than

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.790
doing anything with the data other than uh data converter and normalizer do. So

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800
uh data converter and normalizer do. So

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.709
uh data converter and normalizer do. So we don't have any additional processing

01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719
we don't have any additional processing

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:52.390
we don't have any additional processing any like sending emails or assigning

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400
any like sending emails or assigning

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.709
any like sending emails or assigning uh additional values anything like that.

01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719
uh additional values anything like that.

01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:58.229
uh additional values anything like that. We're just basically exporting data.

01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239
We're just basically exporting data.

01:23:58.239 --> 01:24:00.709
We're just basically exporting data. So we have only a data converter and

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719
So we have only a data converter and

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:03.830
So we have only a data converter and data converter also this is actually the

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840
data converter also this is actually the

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.030
data converter also this is actually the one uh that is in the import processor

01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040
one uh that is in the import processor

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.430
one uh that is in the import processor we can re reuse exactly the same one. Uh

01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440
we can re reuse exactly the same one. Uh

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.470
we can re reuse exactly the same one. Uh we need to tag it with the processor tag

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480
we need to tag it with the processor tag

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.390
we need to tag it with the processor tag so application will know that this is

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400
so application will know that this is

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.830
so application will know that this is import export processor type is export

01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840
import export processor type is export

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.470
import export processor type is export which entity we want to export and give

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480
which entity we want to export and give

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.390
which entity we want to export and give it some alias

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400
it some alias

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.830
it some alias and here uh for the export template. So

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840
and here uh for the export template. So

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.830
and here uh for the export template. So for downloading some um example CSV file

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840
for downloading some um example CSV file

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.550
for downloading some um example CSV file with dummy data we need to have separate

01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560
with dummy data we need to have separate

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.790
with dummy data we need to have separate processor because the data converter is

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800
processor because the data converter is

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.310
processor because the data converter is not the same because first one uh in the

01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320
not the same because first one uh in the

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.790
not the same because first one uh in the first we have data from database and

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800
first we have data from database and

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.790
first we have data from database and here we have data from our PHP code from

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800
here we have data from our PHP code from

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.910
here we have data from our PHP code from some file

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920
some file

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.709
some file uh and we have dummy data here that's

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719
uh and we have dummy data here that's

01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:55.669
uh and we have dummy data here that's why we need to create separate processor

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679
why we need to create separate processor

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:58.870
why we need to create separate processor uh so different data converter and this

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880
uh so different data converter and this

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.830
uh so different data converter and this one

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840
one

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.790
one has a different parent.

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800
has a different parent.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.629
has a different parent. Again, no customization here. Just

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639
Again, no customization here. Just

01:25:06.639 --> 01:25:08.390
Again, no customization here. Just reusing parent classes that we have in

01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400
reusing parent classes that we have in

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.790
reusing parent classes that we have in Ouro bundles

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800
Ouro bundles

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.870
Ouro bundles and we need to tag it with processor tag

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880
and we need to tag it with processor tag

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.990
and we need to tag it with processor tag type export template which entity and

01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000
type export template which entity and

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.390
type export template which entity and give it some alias. Okay. So, normally

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400
give it some alias. Okay. So, normally

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.470
give it some alias. Okay. So, normally you will have two export processors and

01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480
you will have two export processors and

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.189
you will have two export processors and one import processor and you're good to

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199
one import processor and you're good to

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:28.229
one import processor and you're good to go. And basically your import export is

01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239
go. And basically your import export is

01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:31.910
go. And basically your import export is already working. Uh but we still need to

01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920
already working. Uh but we still need to

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.709
already working. Uh but we still need to have uh buttons to be able to

01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719
have uh buttons to be able to

01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:41.910
have uh buttons to be able to execute import or export.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.510
Okay, just to summarize for the import,

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520
Okay, just to summarize for the import,

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.470
Okay, just to summarize for the import, we have CSV file reader. Then we're

01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480
we have CSV file reader. Then we're

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.030
we have CSV file reader. Then we're doing the import and writing to null

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040
doing the import and writing to null

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.590
doing the import and writing to null because it's just validation.

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600
because it's just validation.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.750
because it's just validation. For the real import the difference is in

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760
For the real import the difference is in

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.189
For the real import the difference is in writer. So we are writing to database.

01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199
writer. So we are writing to database.

01:25:59.199 --> 01:26:01.510
writer. So we are writing to database. For the export the difference will be in

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520
For the export the difference will be in

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.390
For the export the difference will be in reader. So for exporting template we

01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400
reader. So for exporting template we

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.830
reader. So for exporting template we read dummy data from fixture

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840
read dummy data from fixture

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.709
read dummy data from fixture and for normal export we're reading data

01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719
and for normal export we're reading data

01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:16.390
and for normal export we're reading data from database.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.990
Uh okay before we go to buttons

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000
Uh okay before we go to buttons

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.790
Uh okay before we go to buttons let me show you how to specify for

01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800
let me show you how to specify for

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.510
let me show you how to specify for example different identifier for import

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520
example different identifier for import

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.470
example different identifier for import export. Um so everything here in code

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480
export. Um so everything here in code

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.950
export. Um so everything here in code will be inside this at config field

01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960
will be inside this at config field

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.910
will be inside this at config field annotation on our entity. So above each

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920
annotation on our entity. So above each

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.750
annotation on our entity. So above each field you have this at config field

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760
field you have this at config field

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.110
field you have this at config field annotation and in the uh section import

01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120
annotation and in the uh section import

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.390
annotation and in the uh section import export you can specify a few elements.

01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400
export you can specify a few elements.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.629
export you can specify a few elements. First of all, you can specify the heer.

01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639
First of all, you can specify the heer.

01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:49.510
First of all, you can specify the heer. So header in CSV file can be specified

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520
So header in CSV file can be specified

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.669
So header in CSV file can be specified here. If not, we will take the

01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679
here. If not, we will take the

01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:54.470
here. If not, we will take the translation. You can specify order. So

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480
translation. You can specify order. So

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.470
translation. You can specify order. So you will have multiple columns in CSV

01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480
you will have multiple columns in CSV

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.590
you will have multiple columns in CSV file and you can reorder them. Then we

01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600
file and you can reorder them. Then we

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.870
file and you can reorder them. Then we have this identity uh mark and this will

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880
have this identity uh mark and this will

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.110
have this identity uh mark and this will mean that this particular field will act

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120
mean that this particular field will act

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.990
mean that this particular field will act as identity field for the import export

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000
as identity field for the import export

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.709
as identity field for the import export but for for the import export only.

01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719
but for for the import export only.

01:27:10.719 --> 01:27:12.870
but for for the import export only. Also, if you don't want to have some

01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880
Also, if you don't want to have some

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.990
Also, if you don't want to have some field in the CSV file, you can mark it

01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000
field in the CSV file, you can mark it

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.149
field in the CSV file, you can mark it as excluded.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159
as excluded.

01:27:18.159 --> 01:27:21.110
as excluded. And um we are also in the import export

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120
And um we are also in the import export

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.030
And um we are also in the import export allowing you to import and export

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040
allowing you to import and export

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.430
allowing you to import and export relations. Okay, so we have contact.

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440
relations. Okay, so we have contact.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.070
relations. Okay, so we have contact. Contact has a phone. Phone is a separate

01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080
Contact has a phone. Phone is a separate

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.709
Contact has a phone. Phone is a separate entity which has label, phone number,

01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719
entity which has label, phone number,

01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:34.790
entity which has label, phone number, prefix or whatever. Uh and in this case

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800
prefix or whatever. Uh and in this case

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.430
prefix or whatever. Uh and in this case here we can specify how this related

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440
here we can specify how this related

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.629
here we can specify how this related entity should be exported. For example,

01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639
entity should be exported. For example,

01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:43.910
entity should be exported. For example, if it's full, then the whole related

01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920
if it's full, then the whole related

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.550
if it's full, then the whole related entity, so the whole phone fields will

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560
entity, so the whole phone fields will

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.870
entity, so the whole phone fields will be exported. If we specify short uh then

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880
be exported. If we specify short uh then

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.070
be exported. If we specify short uh then only identity fields of this related

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080
only identity fields of this related

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.229
only identity fields of this related entity will be in our export file

01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239
entity will be in our export file

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:01.910
entity will be in our export file and we can do it in the code preferably

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920
and we can do it in the code preferably

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.310
and we can do it in the code preferably always do it from the code, but also

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320
always do it from the code, but also

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.750
always do it from the code, but also it's possible to do it uh through the UI

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760
it's possible to do it uh through the UI

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.790
it's possible to do it uh through the UI uh in the entity management. So I can go

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800
uh in the entity management. So I can go

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.229
uh in the entity management. So I can go to system entity management. Let's go to

01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239
to system entity management. Let's go to

01:28:14.239 --> 01:28:18.870
to system entity management. Let's go to my contact.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.070
I will open any

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.830
row and import export.

01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840
row and import export.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.350
row and import export. Uh column name if we don't pass then uh

01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360
Uh column name if we don't pass then uh

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.110
Uh column name if we don't pass then uh translation will be used. So usually

01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120
translation will be used. So usually

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.270
translation will be used. So usually it's empty. Uh column position

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280
it's empty. Uh column position

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.189
it's empty. Uh column position in contact export we have a lot of

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199
in contact export we have a lot of

01:28:39.199 --> 01:28:42.470
in contact export we have a lot of columns so that's probably it's so high

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480
columns so that's probably it's so high

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.030
columns so that's probably it's so high uh if this birthday field should be

01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040
uh if this birthday field should be

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.229
uh if this birthday field should be identity field. No and we don't want to

01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239
identity field. No and we don't want to

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.470
identity field. No and we don't want to exclude columns

01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480
exclude columns

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.070
exclude columns and how to do it from the

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.270
entity file.

01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280
entity file.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.470
entity file. Okay. So above every field you can

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480
Okay. So above every field you can

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.550
Okay. So above every field you can specify inside the config field

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560
specify inside the config field

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.149
specify inside the config field annotation

01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159
annotation

01:29:08.159 --> 01:29:11.430
annotation uh in the import export section for

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440
uh in the import export section for

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.590
uh in the import export section for example order. Okay. So if you want to

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600
example order. Okay. So if you want to

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.149
example order. Okay. So if you want to order columns this is how to specify it

01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159
order columns this is how to specify it

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:20.390
order columns this is how to specify it and here is also order and here too. uh

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400
and here is also order and here too. uh

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.750
and here is also order and here too. uh then this is lead and when we're going

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760
then this is lead and when we're going

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.110
then this is lead and when we're going to import leads we don't want to check

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120
to import leads we don't want to check

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.510
to import leads we don't want to check for duplicates by ID because while

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520
for duplicates by ID because while

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.830
for duplicates by ID because while importing we will actually not even pass

01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840
importing we will actually not even pass

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.629
importing we will actually not even pass this ID uh because this field will be

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639
this ID uh because this field will be

01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:38.390
this ID uh because this field will be automatically created on insert

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400
automatically created on insert

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.709
automatically created on insert uh so for the import export we want to

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719
uh so for the import export we want to

01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:45.350
uh so for the import export we want to specify that

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360
specify that

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.870
specify that the name of our lit will be actually our

01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880
the name of our lit will be actually our

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.910
the name of our lit will be actually our identifier

01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920
identifier

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.550
identifier So while importing leads if there will

01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560
So while importing leads if there will

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.990
So while importing leads if there will be any leads already in our database

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000
be any leads already in our database

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.189
be any leads already in our database with this name then it will be updated

01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199
with this name then it will be updated

01:29:59.199 --> 01:30:01.510
with this name then it will be updated and this is how to sp specify that this

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520
and this is how to sp specify that this

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.149
and this is how to sp specify that this particular field it's going to be as an

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159
particular field it's going to be as an

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:07.030
particular field it's going to be as an and it's going to be our identifier for

01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040
and it's going to be our identifier for

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.229
and it's going to be our identifier for import export and yes you can create

01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239
import export and yes you can create

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:13.189
import export and yes you can create like with primary key we can uh create

01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199
like with primary key we can uh create

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:15.430
like with primary key we can uh create multiple fields to be primary key here

01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440
multiple fields to be primary key here

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.430
multiple fields to be primary key here you can also specify that for example

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440
you can also specify that for example

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.430
you can also specify that for example name plus name prefix

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440
name plus name prefix

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.390
name plus name prefix are identifier. So in this case just

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400
are identifier. So in this case just

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.790
are identifier. So in this case just specify identity true here and here.

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800
specify identity true here and here.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.310
specify identity true here and here. Uh okay what we have more short uh so

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320
Uh okay what we have more short uh so

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.110
Uh okay what we have more short uh so either full true or short true or short

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120
either full true or short true or short

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.830
either full true or short true or short false. So you have options

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840
false. So you have options

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.830
false. So you have options uh lead has a relation to a contact

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840
uh lead has a relation to a contact

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.390
uh lead has a relation to a contact entity. That's a separate entity. And

01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400
entity. That's a separate entity. And

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.510
entity. That's a separate entity. And now when we export leads uh in this

01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520
now when we export leads uh in this

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.149
now when we export leads uh in this export we don't want to have every field

01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159
export we don't want to have every field

01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:51.669
export we don't want to have every field from our contact. We just want to have

01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679
from our contact. We just want to have

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.990
from our contact. We just want to have identity fields. That's why we specify

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000
identity fields. That's why we specify

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.110
identity fields. That's why we specify short true. So the rel related fields

01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120
short true. So the rel related fields

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:01.669
short true. So the rel related fields our contact will be um exported in

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679
our contact will be um exported in

01:31:01.679 --> 01:31:04.149
our contact will be um exported in shorten version.

01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159
shorten version.

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:06.629
shorten version. And then what we have

01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639
And then what we have

01:31:06.639 --> 01:31:08.500
And then what we have more

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:08.510
more

01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:09.830
more [Music]

01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840
[Music]

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.270
[Music] order order.

01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280
order order.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.510
order order. Oh, here you have full true. So for

01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520
Oh, here you have full true. So for

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.470
Oh, here you have full true. So for address, we actually want to uh export

01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480
address, we actually want to uh export

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.590
address, we actually want to uh export all address fields.

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600
all address fields.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.390
all address fields. Uh create that. We don't want to export

01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400
Uh create that. We don't want to export

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.350
Uh create that. We don't want to export or import it at all. Right? So excludes

01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360
or import it at all. Right? So excludes

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.149
or import it at all. Right? So excludes is true. And that's basically all the

01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159
is true. And that's basically all the

01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:35.510
is true. And that's basically all the options that we have here.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.709
Okay. And link for the future reference

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719
Okay. And link for the future reference

01:31:38.719 --> 01:31:40.250
Okay. And link for the future reference for the documentation

01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:40.260
for the documentation

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.669
for the documentation [Music]

01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679
[Music]

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:43.590
[Music] of those fields. But basically this is

01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600
of those fields. But basically this is

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.470
of those fields. But basically this is exactly what I've shown you. Yes.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480
exactly what I've shown you. Yes.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:53.830
exactly what I've shown you. Yes. So we we can override this configuration

01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840
So we we can override this configuration

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.590
So we we can override this configuration or

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.990
uh can you repeat? You can override this

01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000
uh can you repeat? You can override this

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.189
uh can you repeat? You can override this override this in admin panel. I mean if

01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199
override this in admin panel. I mean if

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:08.950
override this in admin panel. I mean if you want to create that column can we

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960
you want to create that column can we

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.189
you want to create that column can we enable it or not in admin panel?

01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199
enable it or not in admin panel?

01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:15.510
enable it or not in admin panel? Yeah here you have only those four

01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520
Yeah here you have only those four

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.870
Yeah here you have only those four options. So the header name position you

01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880
options. So the header name position you

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.990
options. So the header name position you use as identity uh exclude include.

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000
use as identity uh exclude include.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.310
use as identity uh exclude include. So you can also here say that you want

01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320
So you can also here say that you want

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.229
So you can also here say that you want to exclude this field from import

01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239
to exclude this field from import

01:32:28.239 --> 01:32:30.629
to exclude this field from import export.

01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639
export.

01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:33.990
export. Okay.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.149
Uh but preferably always do it from the

01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159
Uh but preferably always do it from the

01:32:36.159 --> 01:32:39.189
Uh but preferably always do it from the code some like here.

01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199
code some like here.

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:41.750
code some like here. And if you want to do it on a core

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760
And if you want to do it on a core

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.350
And if you want to do it on a core entity then for this we have this uh to

01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360
entity then for this we have this uh to

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.750
entity then for this we have this uh to write migration similar to the one that

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760
write migration similar to the one that

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.430
write migration similar to the one that you actually created to modify the label

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440
you actually created to modify the label

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.910
you actually created to modify the label for entity.

01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920
for entity.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.629
for entity. So that's actually this kind of uh

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639
So that's actually this kind of uh

01:32:56.639 --> 01:33:00.790
So that's actually this kind of uh migration.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.709
Okay. So uh right now you know how to

01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719
Okay. So uh right now you know how to

01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:10.149
Okay. So uh right now you know how to configure what to export uh on our

01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159
configure what to export uh on our

01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:14.149
configure what to export uh on our entity. We have all the processors um

01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159
entity. We have all the processors um

01:33:14.159 --> 01:33:17.110
entity. We have all the processors um data data serializers uh sorry data

01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120
data data serializers uh sorry data

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.070
data data serializers uh sorry data converters and serializers in place. And

01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080
converters and serializers in place. And

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.149
converters and serializers in place. And basically our import export is working

01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159
basically our import export is working

01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:24.070
basically our import export is working but we still need to have a way to

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080
but we still need to have a way to

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.030
but we still need to have a way to execute it. And for this we need to

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040
execute it. And for this we need to

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.310
execute it. And for this we need to create uh or display anywhere import

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320
create uh or display anywhere import

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.870
create uh or display anywhere import export buttons. And for the import

01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880
export buttons. And for the import

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.390
export buttons. And for the import export buttons we have um some ready

01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400
export buttons we have um some ready

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.350
export buttons we have um some ready elements for you. Uh so to display those

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360
elements for you. Uh so to display those

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:45.510
elements for you. Uh so to display those buttons like I see it here

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.790
those are displayed with a template that

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800
those are displayed with a template that

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.390
those are displayed with a template that is called uh button configuration HTML

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400
is called uh button configuration HTML

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.430
is called uh button configuration HTML tweak and sits in our or import export

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440
tweak and sits in our or import export

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.990
tweak and sits in our or import export bundle. So uh on our index uh page we

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000
bundle. So uh on our index uh page we

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.910
bundle. So uh on our index uh page we will just basically include this

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920
will just basically include this

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.830
will just basically include this template and this template requires uh

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840
template and this template requires uh

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.310
template and this template requires uh us to pass the configuration alias

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320
us to pass the configuration alias

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.790
us to pass the configuration alias because those buttons needs to know uh

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800
because those buttons needs to know uh

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.310
because those buttons needs to know uh what jobs uh to execute uh with what

01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320
what jobs uh to execute uh with what

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.950
what jobs uh to execute uh with what which processors etc. So when I click it

01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960
which processors etc. So when I click it

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.390
which processors etc. So when I click it appropriate job with appropriate

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400
appropriate job with appropriate

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.470
appropriate job with appropriate processor will be executed. So we need

01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480
processor will be executed. So we need

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.590
processor will be executed. So we need to pass uh this configuration

01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600
to pass uh this configuration

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.830
to pass uh this configuration and this configuration um is the only

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840
and this configuration um is the only

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.950
and this configuration um is the only PHP class that you need to implement. So

01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960
PHP class that you need to implement. So

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.790
PHP class that you need to implement. So we need to implement PHP uh class uh it

01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800
we need to implement PHP uh class uh it

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.750
we need to implement PHP uh class uh it needs to extend this interface with a

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760
needs to extend this interface with a

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.390
needs to extend this interface with a very long name and it needs to be

01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400
very long name and it needs to be

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.870
very long name and it needs to be registered in a DA container with this

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880
registered in a DA container with this

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.030
registered in a DA container with this particular tag which is or import export

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040
particular tag which is or import export

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.870
particular tag which is or import export configuration.

01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880
configuration.

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.110
configuration. So first you need to create this uh

01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.120
So first you need to create this uh

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.189
So first you need to create this uh configuration provider. This is

01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199
configuration provider. This is

01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:53.990
configuration provider. This is basically a PHP class that's going to be

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000
basically a PHP class that's going to be

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.790
basically a PHP class that's going to be our service and it implements import

01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800
our service and it implements import

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.669
our service and it implements import export configuration provider interface.

01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679
export configuration provider interface.

01:34:59.679 --> 01:35:01.750
export configuration provider interface. And this interface will force you to

01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760
And this interface will force you to

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.350
And this interface will force you to implement get method

01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360
implement get method

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.350
implement get method and in here you just need to return

01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360
and in here you just need to return

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.750
and in here you just need to return import export configuration and pass

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760
import export configuration and pass

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.590
import export configuration and pass some

01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600
some

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.550
some information. So under field entity class

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560
information. So under field entity class

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.709
information. So under field entity class uh what entity we're going to import or

01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719
uh what entity we're going to import or

01:35:16.719 --> 01:35:18.629
uh what entity we're going to import or export for us this will be usernaming

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639
export for us this will be usernaming

01:35:18.639 --> 01:35:20.629
export for us this will be usernaming type then

01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639
type then

01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:23.350
type then export processor alias and this goes

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360
export processor alias and this goes

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.709
export processor alias and this goes directly to this alias this is my export

01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719
directly to this alias this is my export

01:35:28.719 --> 01:35:30.310
directly to this alias this is my export processor

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320
processor

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.430
processor so this alias the example is not the

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440
so this alias the example is not the

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.070
so this alias the example is not the same but this will be this alias then

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080
same but this will be this alias then

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.110
same but this will be this alias then import processor alias and if you have

01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120
import processor alias and if you have

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.110
import processor alias and if you have then also export template processor

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:41.120
then also export template processor

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:42.070
then also export template processor alias

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080
alias

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.709
alias So those are the aliases that we added

01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719
So those are the aliases that we added

01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:47.270
So those are the aliases that we added to our processors when we were

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280
to our processors when we were

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.990
to our processors when we were registering it. We're registering them

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000
registering it. We're registering them

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.229
registering it. We're registering them in here.

01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239
in here.

01:35:52.239 --> 01:35:54.629
in here. Uh yeah, and that's basically it. That's

01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639
Uh yeah, and that's basically it. That's

01:35:54.639 --> 01:35:58.470
Uh yeah, and that's basically it. That's our configuration. You need to define it

01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480
our configuration. You need to define it

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.830
our configuration. You need to define it in a DI container.

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840
in a DI container.

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:05.189
in a DI container. So this is my custom configuration

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199
So this is my custom configuration

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:08.310
So this is my custom configuration provider implementation in here and we

01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320
provider implementation in here and we

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.790
provider implementation in here and we need to tag it with oro import export

01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800
need to tag it with oro import export

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.870
need to tag it with oro import export configuration tag and give it some

01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880
configuration tag and give it some

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:18.070
configuration tag and give it some alias. Then this alias

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.910
on our this is index html tweak inside

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920
on our this is index html tweak inside

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.229
on our this is index html tweak inside navigation buttons block we want to

01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239
navigation buttons block we want to

01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:26.550
navigation buttons block we want to include this template buttons from

01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560
include this template buttons from

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.750
include this template buttons from configuration and only pass the alias of

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760
configuration and only pass the alias of

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.910
configuration and only pass the alias of our configuration file. So this here.

01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920
our configuration file. So this here.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.990
our configuration file. So this here. Okay.

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000
Okay.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.950
Okay. So very short configuration class

01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960
So very short configuration class

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.990
So very short configuration class register it and give it some alias and

01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000
register it and give it some alias and

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.669
register it and give it some alias and then import this template that will

01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679
then import this template that will

01:36:45.679 --> 01:36:49.109
then import this template that will render buttons and just pass the alias

01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119
render buttons and just pass the alias

01:36:49.119 --> 01:36:51.430
render buttons and just pass the alias of our configuration and you will be

01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440
of our configuration and you will be

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.229
of our configuration and you will be good to go.

01:36:56.239 --> 01:37:00.390
Um yeah and that's basically everything.

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400
Um yeah and that's basically everything.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.870
Um yeah and that's basically everything. So in a moment when we will do the

01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880
So in a moment when we will do the

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.590
So in a moment when we will do the practice you'll see that creating um

01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600
practice you'll see that creating um

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.709
practice you'll see that creating um this default import export it's really

01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719
this default import export it's really

01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:16.390
this default import export it's really mostly registering services.

01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400
mostly registering services.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.709
mostly registering services. uh the only class for the nonoptional

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719
uh the only class for the nonoptional

01:37:20.719 --> 01:37:22.629
uh the only class for the nonoptional part that you will need to implement is

01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639
part that you will need to implement is

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:25.510
part that you will need to implement is this configuration provider other you

01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520
this configuration provider other you

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.430
this configuration provider other you will just register services and that's

01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440
will just register services and that's

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.510
will just register services and that's it

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520
it

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.669
it and some potential issues that you may

01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679
and some potential issues that you may

01:37:33.679 --> 01:37:36.390
and some potential issues that you may have or maybe not uh potential issues

01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400
have or maybe not uh potential issues

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.109
have or maybe not uh potential issues but kind of ideas and that's pretty

01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119
but kind of ideas and that's pretty

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.870
but kind of ideas and that's pretty obvious I think that if you need to use

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880
obvious I think that if you need to use

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.590
obvious I think that if you need to use custom data format then do it with data

01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600
custom data format then do it with data

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.270
custom data format then do it with data converter

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280
converter

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.149
converter Um and uh at some situations you may

01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159
Um and uh at some situations you may

01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:53.910
Um and uh at some situations you may find the import export too slow. Uh it's

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920
find the import export too slow. Uh it's

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.950
find the import export too slow. Uh it's not a common case but for example when

01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960
not a common case but for example when

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.709
not a common case but for example when we import price lists

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719
we import price lists

01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:03.910
we import price lists this is doing a lot of stuff inside. So

01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920
this is doing a lot of stuff inside. So

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.790
this is doing a lot of stuff inside. So if you want to skip using this uh

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800
if you want to skip using this uh

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.310
if you want to skip using this uh normalizers

01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320
normalizers

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.910
normalizers uh

01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920
uh

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.590
uh uh strategies etc. you will need to

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600
uh strategies etc. you will need to

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.870
uh strategies etc. you will need to implement your own processor and work

01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880
implement your own processor and work

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.270
implement your own processor and work directly with debug there. Okay. So we

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280
directly with debug there. Okay. So we

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.709
directly with debug there. Okay. So we do have some projects actually I was a

01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719
do have some projects actually I was a

01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:27.189
do have some projects actually I was a part only of one then we where we

01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199
part only of one then we where we

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:29.990
part only of one then we where we overrode the default import export for

01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000
overrode the default import export for

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.830
overrode the default import export for price lists because it was too slow and

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840
price lists because it was too slow and

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.070
price lists because it was too slow and they had really custom price list per

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080
they had really custom price list per

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.750
they had really custom price list per each customer and so on. Uh so we

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760
each customer and so on. Uh so we

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.910
each customer and so on. Uh so we basically reimplemented the whole

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920
basically reimplemented the whole

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.870
basically reimplemented the whole processor. We're not using uh data

01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880
processor. We're not using uh data

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.790
processor. We're not using uh data converter. We're not using normalizer.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800
converter. We're not using normalizer.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.390
converter. We're not using normalizer. We're not using strategy. We're not

01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400
We're not using strategy. We're not

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.750
We're not using strategy. We're not working on objects. Uh we are just have

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760
working on objects. Uh we are just have

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.950
working on objects. Uh we are just have plain SQL there. So in this case, this

01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960
plain SQL there. So in this case, this

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:58.229
plain SQL there. So in this case, this will be a custom processor

01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239
will be a custom processor

01:38:58.239 --> 01:39:00.070
will be a custom processor documentation for everything that we

01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080
documentation for everything that we

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.390
documentation for everything that we talked about

01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400
talked about

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.870
talked about and uh best practices. So if you need to

01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880
and uh best practices. So if you need to

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.030
and uh best practices. So if you need to import some entities into Oro and we

01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040
import some entities into Oro and we

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.990
import some entities into Oro and we have already built in uh import export

01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000
have already built in uh import export

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.270
have already built in uh import export then just go ahead and use it. Uh but we

01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280
then just go ahead and use it. Uh but we

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.950
then just go ahead and use it. Uh but we don't have import export for all the

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960
don't have import export for all the

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.510
don't have import export for all the entities. Um

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.310
so in this case if you're sure that you

01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320
so in this case if you're sure that you

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.950
so in this case if you're sure that you will import something only once you

01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960
will import something only once you

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.629
will import something only once you don't need to implement the whole import

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639
don't need to implement the whole import

01:39:28.639 --> 01:39:31.590
don't need to implement the whole import export. can still just go and create a

01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600
export. can still just go and create a

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.950
export. can still just go and create a command and just basically import it

01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960
command and just basically import it

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.270
command and just basically import it once from some file.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.229
Uh okay. Okay. Then another situation

01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239
Uh okay. Okay. Then another situation

01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:45.030
Uh okay. Okay. Then another situation that uh we don't have out of the box uh

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040
that uh we don't have out of the box uh

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.070
that uh we don't have out of the box uh import export in place and you need to

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080
import export in place and you need to

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.310
import export in place and you need to implement it but you are sure that you

01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320
implement it but you are sure that you

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.390
implement it but you are sure that you will never reuse data converters

01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400
will never reuse data converters

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.510
will never reuse data converters normalizes strategies uh then you can

01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520
normalizes strategies uh then you can

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.910
normalizes strategies uh then you can also create a custom processor

01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920
also create a custom processor

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.310
also create a custom processor but and also remember that whenever you

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320
but and also remember that whenever you

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.669
but and also remember that whenever you use custom import you need to validate

01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679
use custom import you need to validate

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:08.310
use custom import you need to validate data on your site because if you use our

01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320
data on your site because if you use our

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.990
data on your site because if you use our import

01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000
import

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.629
import and all the validation that is specify

01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639
and all the validation that is specify

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.550
and all the validation that is specify for example in the validation YAML file

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560
for example in the validation YAML file

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.790
for example in the validation YAML file that I've shown you last week this

01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800
that I've shown you last week this

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.830
that I've shown you last week this validation will be in place so will be

01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840
validation will be in place so will be

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.510
validation will be in place so will be executed if you use our uh our way but

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520
executed if you use our uh our way but

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.669
executed if you use our uh our way but if you have something custom just don't

01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679
if you have something custom just don't

01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:27.750
if you have something custom just don't forget uh to validate the entities

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760
forget uh to validate the entities

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.109
forget uh to validate the entities before you inject them to database

01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119
before you inject them to database

01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:33.189
before you inject them to database and you will see that in the practice

01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199
and you will see that in the practice

01:40:33.199 --> 01:40:35.669
and you will see that in the practice that the standard default import export

01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679
that the standard default import export

01:40:35.679 --> 01:40:39.590
that the standard default import export is pretty easy to set and we

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600
is pretty easy to set and we

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.870
is pretty easy to set and we will not have a lot of PHP coding like

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880
will not have a lot of PHP coding like

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.470
will not have a lot of PHP coding like almost none. Uh but later on if you'll

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480
almost none. Uh but later on if you'll

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.830
almost none. Uh but later on if you'll try to customize it then it might be

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840
try to customize it then it might be

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.990
try to customize it then it might be hard at the beginning. So in case you

01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000
hard at the beginning. So in case you

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.550
hard at the beginning. So in case you will have that kind of tickets in your

01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560
will have that kind of tickets in your

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.870
will have that kind of tickets in your project just add some a little bit more

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880
project just add some a little bit more

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.350
project just add some a little bit more buffer that normally uh for other

01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360
buffer that normally uh for other

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.790
buffer that normally uh for other tickets if it goes to import export.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.189
Okay, before we go to practice, do you

01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199
Okay, before we go to practice, do you

01:41:07.199 --> 01:41:12.950
Okay, before we go to practice, do you have any questions?

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.189
So, let's

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199
So, let's

01:41:15.199 --> 01:41:17.669
So, let's have a question. So, the most common

01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679
have a question. So, the most common

01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:20.790
have a question. So, the most common case on my project was to set up the

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800
case on my project was to set up the

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.830
case on my project was to set up the crown job and to do export by chron job.

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840
crown job and to do export by chron job.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.669
crown job and to do export by chron job. Um, how can I reuse this export in my

01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679
Um, how can I reuse this export in my

01:41:29.679 --> 01:41:31.910
Um, how can I reuse this export in my command maybe?

01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920
command maybe?

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.350
command maybe? Mhm. So this command uh this uh

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360
Mhm. So this command uh this uh

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.550
Mhm. So this command uh this uh basically our button here this export or

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560
basically our button here this export or

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.430
basically our button here this export or import is executing a job and sending it

01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440
import is executing a job and sending it

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.149
import is executing a job and sending it to message Q. So you can basically send

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159
to message Q. So you can basically send

01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:45.910
to message Q. So you can basically send this message with message producer on

01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920
this message with message producer on

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.189
this message with message producer on the message Q the same one

01:41:51.199 --> 01:41:54.070
and the format of this message I can

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080
and the format of this message I can

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.590
and the format of this message I can check in message Q.

01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600
check in message Q.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.990
check in message Q. uh format of this message you can check

01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000
uh format of this message you can check

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.550
uh format of this message you can check uh with uh inside import export bundle

01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560
uh with uh inside import export bundle

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.030
uh with uh inside import export bundle with the export processor because it's

01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040
with the export processor because it's

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.950
with the export processor because it's sending messages. It's sending the main

01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960
sending messages. It's sending the main

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.950
sending messages. It's sending the main message. You can just basically check

01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960
message. You can just basically check

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.709
message. You can just basically check what's exactly happening when you click

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719
what's exactly happening when you click

01:42:10.719 --> 01:42:12.470
what's exactly happening when you click this button.

01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480
this button.

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.590
this button. Okay.

01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600
Okay.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.790
Okay. So I can click it and I can show you in

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800
So I can click it and I can show you in

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.629
So I can click it and I can show you in database

01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639
database

01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:21.910
database what's the job. So I clicked it and now

01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920
what's the job. So I clicked it and now

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.990
what's the job. So I clicked it and now as a result

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.310
I have a job. I have many jobs.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320
I have a job. I have many jobs.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.629
I have a job. I have many jobs. This is the one. So as you can see this

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639
This is the one. So as you can see this

01:42:32.639 --> 01:42:35.669
This is the one. So as you can see this is a job name entity export to CSV

01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679
is a job name entity export to CSV

01:42:35.679 --> 01:42:39.189
is a job name entity export to CSV processor alias or a contact and so on.

01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199
processor alias or a contact and so on.

01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:41.030
processor alias or a contact and so on. So this was pushed when I clicked the

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040
So this was pushed when I clicked the

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.870
So this was pushed when I clicked the button. So you would need to do exactly

01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880
button. So you would need to do exactly

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.590
button. So you would need to do exactly the same and we unfortunately don't have

01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600
the same and we unfortunately don't have

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.310
the same and we unfortunately don't have a message Q topic on this uh on this

01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320
a message Q topic on this uh on this

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.070
a message Q topic on this uh on this training which would be really nice to

01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080
training which would be really nice to

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.790
training which would be really nice to have because it's a cool thing but to

01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800
have because it's a cool thing but to

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.669
have because it's a cool thing but to send those that kind of messages we use

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679
send those that kind of messages we use

01:42:55.679 --> 01:43:02.550
send those that kind of messages we use message producer

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.629
producer I hope I have it.

01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639
producer I hope I have it.

01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:21.510
producer I hope I have it. Oh my god.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:28.870
Okay. Maybe different.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.750
I can send you example maybe after the

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760
I can send you example maybe after the

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.590
I can send you example maybe after the break. Okay. I don't want to

01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600
break. Okay. I don't want to

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.830
break. Okay. I don't want to Okay.

01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840
Okay.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.590
Okay. Basically it's a service that you use

01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600
Basically it's a service that you use

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.350
Basically it's a service that you use that has sent message and you need to

01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360
that has sent message and you need to

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.669
that has sent message and you need to pass appropriate elements there and this

01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679
pass appropriate elements there and this

01:43:41.679 --> 01:43:44.229
pass appropriate elements there and this message to each one one more question.

01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239
message to each one one more question.

01:43:44.239 --> 01:43:47.669
message to each one one more question. So um as you see it happens a

01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679
So um as you see it happens a

01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:52.790
So um as you see it happens a synchronously and um after after import

01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800
synchronously and um after after import

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.310
synchronously and um after after import export um export was processed then we

01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320
export um export was processed then we

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:00.790
export um export was processed then we get link to download file or what we get

01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800
get link to download file or what we get

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.550
get link to download file or what we get uh so uh you need to start consumers so

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560
uh so uh you need to start consumers so

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:06.310
uh so uh you need to start consumers so this message will be processed because

01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320
this message will be processed because

basically, I have answers uh for the

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:45.030
basically, I have answers uh for the questions about how to trigger uh from

01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040
questions about how to trigger uh from

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.470
questions about how to trigger uh from the PHP for example to export

01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480
the PHP for example to export

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.270
the PHP for example to export uh something and I've pasted on the chat

01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280
uh something and I've pasted on the chat

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.950
uh something and I've pasted on the chat here and he will just not see it. So if

01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960
here and he will just not see it. So if

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.390
here and he will just not see it. So if you can just share this

01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400
you can just share this

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.950
you can just share this uh with him that would be nice.

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960
uh with him that would be nice.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.390
uh with him that would be nice. Okay, I'll see if he's gonna jump back

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400
Okay, I'll see if he's gonna jump back

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.669
Okay, I'll see if he's gonna jump back on otherwise I can copy it over.

01:47:07.679 --> 01:47:10.310
Okay, I will start sharing my screen and

01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320
Okay, I will start sharing my screen and

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.460
Okay, I will start sharing my screen and the practice will be

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:12.470
the practice will be

01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:19.109
the practice will be [Music]

01:47:19.119 --> 01:47:24.229
okay.

01:47:24.239 --> 01:47:27.669
Uh so for the practice I actually I've

01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679
Uh so for the practice I actually I've

01:47:27.679 --> 01:47:30.229
Uh so for the practice I actually I've given you the examples to exactly the

01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239
given you the examples to exactly the

01:47:30.239 --> 01:47:32.870
given you the examples to exactly the thing that you need to do on your site.

01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880
thing that you need to do on your site.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.750
thing that you need to do on your site. Uh so you don't need to search for it.

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760
Uh so you don't need to search for it.

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.310
Uh so you don't need to search for it. So I've provide pro I've provided you

01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320
So I've provide pro I've provided you

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.709
So I've provide pro I've provided you with example for the simple things

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719
with example for the simple things

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:42.390
with example for the simple things exactly the one that you will do for

01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400
exactly the one that you will do for

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.790
exactly the one that you will do for import export. So at the end of doing

01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800
import export. So at the end of doing

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:48.149
import export. So at the end of doing the nonoptional part

01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159
the nonoptional part

01:47:48.159 --> 01:47:51.750
the nonoptional part you should see on the usernaming type

01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760
you should see on the usernaming type

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.790
you should see on the usernaming type index page those two buttons

01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800
index page those two buttons

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.669
index page those two buttons and under the import file file you will

01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679
and under the import file file you will

01:47:57.679 --> 01:48:00.390
and under the import file file you will have both validate and import file. You

01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400
have both validate and import file. You

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.629
have both validate and import file. You will not have download import template

01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639
will not have download import template

01:48:02.639 --> 01:48:05.189
will not have download import template yet because this this one is actually

01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199
yet because this this one is actually

01:48:05.199 --> 01:48:08.070
yet because this this one is actually the optional part. Okay. So you will

01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080
the optional part. Okay. So you will

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.390
the optional part. Okay. So you will have all the others. So you'll be able

01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400
have all the others. So you'll be able

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.629
have all the others. So you'll be able to test it and because you will not have

01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639
to test it and because you will not have

01:48:12.639 --> 01:48:15.510
to test it and because you will not have a way to download some dummy template

01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520
a way to download some dummy template

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.750
a way to download some dummy template then the best way will be to do the

01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760
then the best way will be to do the

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.830
then the best way will be to do the export and reuse the CSV file for import

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840
export and reuse the CSV file for import

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:24.550
export and reuse the CSV file for import just remember the to remove the ID

01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560
just remember the to remove the ID

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.390
just remember the to remove the ID column because you don't want to import

01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400
column because you don't want to import

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.590
column because you don't want to import ID you can but basically don't

01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600
ID you can but basically don't

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.030
ID you can but basically don't uh okay so how to do this import export

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040
uh okay so how to do this import export

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.830
uh okay so how to do this import export first you need to

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840
first you need to

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.510
first you need to um

01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520
um

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:42.390
um register some services for data

01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400
register some services for data

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.950
register some services for data converters, serializers and processor.

01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960
converters, serializers and processor.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.510
converters, serializers and processor. You will not have any custom thing here.

01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520
You will not have any custom thing here.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.550
You will not have any custom thing here. You will just reuse our default

01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560
You will just reuse our default

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.149
You will just reuse our default processors, data converter and

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159
processors, data converter and

01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:55.270
processors, data converter and serializer and strategy. And this will

01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280
serializer and strategy. And this will

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.950
serializer and strategy. And this will be like here

01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960
be like here

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.629
be like here this is example for the tax.

01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639
this is example for the tax.

01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:05.669
this is example for the tax. So for the data converter you don't need

01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679
So for the data converter you don't need

01:49:05.679 --> 01:49:07.830
So for the data converter you don't need any custom things. So we just register a

01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840
any custom things. So we just register a

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:10.470
any custom things. So we just register a service and make sure that the parent is

01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480
service and make sure that the parent is

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.629
service and make sure that the parent is our default one. So data converter

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639
our default one. So data converter

01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:14.709
our default one. So data converter configurable

01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719
configurable

01:49:14.719 --> 01:49:16.870
configurable uh for the strategy also no

01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880
uh for the strategy also no

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.350
uh for the strategy also no customization. So just make sure that

01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360
customization. So just make sure that

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.350
customization. So just make sure that the parent is configurable add or

01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360
the parent is configurable add or

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.950
the parent is configurable add or replace this default one. Uh then the

01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960
replace this default one. Uh then the

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.550
replace this default one. Uh then the processor for export only one you don't

01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560
processor for export only one you don't

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.910
processor for export only one you don't have export template yet. parent is our

01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920
have export template yet. parent is our

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.870
have export template yet. parent is our export abstract processor and you need

01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880
export abstract processor and you need

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.870
export abstract processor and you need to set data converter and this is

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880
to set data converter and this is

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.830
to set data converter and this is exactly the one that we just registered

01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840
exactly the one that we just registered

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.550
exactly the one that we just registered here and you need to tag it with this

01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560
here and you need to tag it with this

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.750
here and you need to tag it with this tag. This is type export. Here you need

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760
tag. This is type export. Here you need

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.310
tag. This is type export. Here you need to pass our entity usernaming type and

01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320
to pass our entity usernaming type and

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.510
to pass our entity usernaming type and give it some alias and then register

01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520
give it some alias and then register

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.950
give it some alias and then register import processor parent is different one

01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960
import processor parent is different one

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:57.189
import processor parent is different one that for here we have import abstract

01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199
that for here we have import abstract

01:49:57.199 --> 01:49:59.430
that for here we have import abstract here we had export abstract. So remember

01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440
here we had export abstract. So remember

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.149
here we had export abstract. So remember that this is different parent data

01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159
that this is different parent data

01:50:02.159 --> 01:50:05.350
that this is different parent data converter that we just registered and

01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360
converter that we just registered and

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.910
converter that we just registered and the strategy

01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920
the strategy

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.709
the strategy that we registered here and then two

01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719
that we registered here and then two

01:50:10.719 --> 01:50:13.990
that we registered here and then two processors because uh two tags because

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000
processors because uh two tags because

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.070
processors because uh two tags because you can reuse the same processor for

01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080
you can reuse the same processor for

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.030
you can reuse the same processor for both import and import validation. So we

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040
both import and import validation. So we

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.910
both import and import validation. So we have two tags both are tagged as

01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920
have two tags both are tagged as

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.310
have two tags both are tagged as processor first is import second import

01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320
processor first is import second import

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.350
processor first is import second import validation and they both import our

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360
validation and they both import our

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.109
validation and they both import our entity for us. This will be usernaming

01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119
entity for us. This will be usernaming

01:50:29.119 --> 01:50:31.350
entity for us. This will be usernaming type and also we need it need to give it

01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360
type and also we need it need to give it

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.510
type and also we need it need to give it some alias. As you can see alias needs

01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520
some alias. As you can see alias needs

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.350
some alias. As you can see alias needs to be unique but only in scope of

01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360
to be unique but only in scope of

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.149
to be unique but only in scope of uh processor type. Okay. So you don't

01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159
uh processor type. Okay. So you don't

01:50:40.159 --> 01:50:42.629
uh processor type. Okay. So you don't you cannot have two import processors

01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639
you cannot have two import processors

01:50:42.639 --> 01:50:46.070
you cannot have two import processors with this alias. But they can be the

01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080
with this alias. But they can be the

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.229
with this alias. But they can be the same for import validate import and

01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239
same for import validate import and

01:50:48.239 --> 01:50:51.030
same for import validate import and export. Probably that's the easiest way.

01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040
export. Probably that's the easiest way.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.189
export. Probably that's the easiest way. And believe me or not but with all this

01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199
And believe me or not but with all this

01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:55.109
And believe me or not but with all this you have already working import export

01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119
you have already working import export

01:50:55.119 --> 01:50:57.189
you have already working import export for usernaming entity. you just don't

01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199
for usernaming entity. you just don't

01:50:57.199 --> 01:51:00.229
for usernaming entity. you just don't have a way to execute it. And the second

01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239
have a way to execute it. And the second

01:51:00.239 --> 01:51:02.229
have a way to execute it. And the second part is to create a way to execute it.

01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239
part is to create a way to execute it.

01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:04.390
part is to create a way to execute it. And for this you need three elements.

01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400
And for this you need three elements.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.189
And for this you need three elements. First is configuration provider.

01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199
First is configuration provider.

01:51:07.199 --> 01:51:09.590
First is configuration provider. And this is this simple class that

01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600
And this is this simple class that

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.070
And this is this simple class that implements this interface. And you need

01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080
implements this interface. And you need

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:14.470
implements this interface. And you need to implement the get method in which you

01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480
to implement the get method in which you

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.109
to implement the get method in which you return the field entity class export

01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119
return the field entity class export

01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:19.189
return the field entity class export processor alias and import processor

01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199
processor alias and import processor

01:51:19.199 --> 01:51:20.790
processor alias and import processor alias.

01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800
alias.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:23.669
alias. You need to register it in a DA

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679
You need to register it in a DA

01:51:23.679 --> 01:51:26.070
You need to register it in a DA container

01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080
container

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.350
container like this. So you give it a name. You

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360
like this. So you give it a name. You

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.590
like this. So you give it a name. You can use uh class name as the name of the

01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:31.600
can use uh class name as the name of the

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.229
can use uh class name as the name of the service and you need to tag it with oro

01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239
service and you need to tag it with oro

01:51:34.239 --> 01:51:35.910
service and you need to tag it with oro import export configuration and give

01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920
import export configuration and give

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.550
import export configuration and give some alias and this alias later go and

01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560
some alias and this alias later go and

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:45.990
some alias and this alias later go and edit index html tweak of our

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.109
this HTML tweak and import those the

01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119
this HTML tweak and import those the

01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:51.990
this HTML tweak and import those the template.

01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000
template.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.030
template. So inside navigation buttons block so it

01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040
So inside navigation buttons block so it

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.830
So inside navigation buttons block so it will go exactly to the top here of the

01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840
will go exactly to the top here of the

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.510
will go exactly to the top here of the page.

01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520
page.

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.149
page. uh just include our base template and

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159
uh just include our base template and

01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:04.870
uh just include our base template and pass the alias of the configuration that

01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880
pass the alias of the configuration that

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.589
pass the alias of the configuration that you just created here and then those

01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599
you just created here and then those

01:52:07.599 --> 01:52:10.070
you just created here and then those buttons should appear in here and you'll

01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080
buttons should appear in here and you'll

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.830
buttons should appear in here and you'll be able to click it. Uh and remember to

01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840
be able to click it. Uh and remember to

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:16.149
be able to click it. Uh and remember to uh start consumers because it will all

01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159
uh start consumers because it will all

01:52:16.159 --> 01:52:18.790
uh start consumers because it will all happen through the message queue and

01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800
happen through the message queue and

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.430
happen through the message queue and that's basically this part. Second part

01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440
that's basically this part. Second part

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.350
that's basically this part. Second part is to

01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360
is to

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:26.950
is to um practice the fact that if you add any

01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960
um practice the fact that if you add any

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.550
um practice the fact that if you add any validation

01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560
validation

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.629
validation for example title and format must not be

01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639
for example title and format must not be

01:52:30.639 --> 01:52:33.350
for example title and format must not be empty and you do it in validation uh

01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360
empty and you do it in validation uh

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.109
empty and you do it in validation uh yaml file the one that comes from

01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119
yaml file the one that comes from

01:52:35.119 --> 01:52:39.189
yaml file the one that comes from symfony then you you will also have uh

01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199
symfony then you you will also have uh

01:52:39.199 --> 01:52:42.629
symfony then you you will also have uh validation errors in import export if

01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639
validation errors in import export if

01:52:42.639 --> 01:52:47.270
validation errors in import export if your CSV file has uh bad values inside.

01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280
your CSV file has uh bad values inside.

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.070
your CSV file has uh bad values inside. Okay. So this is just to practice uh the

01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:50.080
Okay. So this is just to practice uh the

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:53.030
Okay. So this is just to practice uh the validation and uh sec the second

01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040
validation and uh sec the second

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:57.270
validation and uh sec the second optional part is to add this button to

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280
optional part is to add this button to

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.790
optional part is to add this button to download some example template. Uh right

01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800
download some example template. Uh right

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.550
download some example template. Uh right so for this actually uh

01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560
so for this actually uh

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.550
so for this actually uh follow the slide because all the

01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560
follow the slide because all the

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:12.070
follow the slide because all the information are really on one slide.

01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080
information are really on one slide.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.589
information are really on one slide. Import template fixture. So example of

01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599
Import template fixture. So example of

01:53:15.599 --> 01:53:20.390
Import template fixture. So example of the fixture file how to define it

01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400
the fixture file how to define it

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.830
the fixture file how to define it and do not forget

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840
and do not forget

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.629
and do not forget about adding this additional parameter

01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639
about adding this additional parameter

01:53:26.639 --> 01:53:29.750
about adding this additional parameter to the configuration file that you

01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760
to the configuration file that you

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:31.830
to the configuration file that you created in

01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840
created in

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.030
created in nonoptional part. So in case uh you will

01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040
nonoptional part. So in case uh you will

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.310
nonoptional part. So in case uh you will have time to do this part then you also

01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320
have time to do this part then you also

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.510
have time to do this part then you also have hints but more here on this slide

01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520
have hints but more here on this slide

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.910
have hints but more here on this slide from the theory.

01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920
from the theory.

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.709
from the theory. Okay. So we have time we have like about

01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719
Okay. So we have time we have like about

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:49.830
Okay. So we have time we have like about two hours for this. So today will start

01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840
two hours for this. So today will start

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:52.470
two hours for this. So today will start tomorrow we will have still some time to

01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480
tomorrow we will have still some time to

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.470
tomorrow we will have still some time to finish it. So don't worry if you don't

01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480
finish it. So don't worry if you don't

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.950
finish it. So don't worry if you don't finish today that's totally normal. Um

01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960
finish today that's totally normal. Um

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:01.750
finish today that's totally normal. Um yeah.

01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760
yeah.

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.990
yeah. Hi Vladimir,

01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000
Hi Vladimir,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.870
Hi Vladimir, I will go through the

01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880
I will go through the

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:10.629
I will go through the first slide for you once more.

01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639
first slide for you once more.

01:54:10.639 --> 01:54:13.750
first slide for you once more. So the we want to create import export

01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760
So the we want to create import export

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.310
So the we want to create import export for our usernaming type entity and at

01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320
for our usernaming type entity and at

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.790
for our usernaming type entity and at the end on our index page of our

01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800
the end on our index page of our

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.550
the end on our index page of our entities will have those buttons and

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560
entities will have those buttons and

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.510
entities will have those buttons and they will trigger export and import. For

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520
they will trigger export and import. For

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.589
they will trigger export and import. For the import you will have validate and

01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599
the import you will have validate and

01:54:25.599 --> 01:54:27.510
the import you will have validate and import file. You will not have download

01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520
import file. You will not have download

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.270
import file. You will not have download import template. This was this last

01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280
import template. This was this last

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.310
import template. This was this last optional task. And so for non-optional

01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320
optional task. And so for non-optional

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.310
optional task. And so for non-optional parts you will just have everything

01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320
parts you will just have everything

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.830
parts you will just have everything except this. So for testing a good way

01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840
except this. So for testing a good way

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.430
except this. So for testing a good way will be to export uh this and use this

01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440
will be to export uh this and use this

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.310
will be to export uh this and use this exported CSV file as a template for

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320
exported CSV file as a template for

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.629
exported CSV file as a template for import just uh remove the ID column and

01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639
import just uh remove the ID column and

01:54:48.639 --> 01:54:51.510
import just uh remove the ID column and that's it. And here you have example how

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520
that's it. And here you have example how

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.990
that's it. And here you have example how to what services to register to create

01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000
to what services to register to create

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.550
to what services to register to create import export for usernaming type. So

01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560
import export for usernaming type. So

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.510
import export for usernaming type. So this will be data converter no custom

01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520
this will be data converter no custom

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.669
this will be data converter no custom PHP code. So just extend parent strategy

01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679
PHP code. So just extend parent strategy

01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:06.390
PHP code. So just extend parent strategy the same and then register export

01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400
the same and then register export

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.350
the same and then register export processor that uses this data converter

01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360
processor that uses this data converter

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.470
processor that uses this data converter that we registered in here.

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480
that we registered in here.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.189
that we registered in here. uh tag it with processor tag type is

01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199
uh tag it with processor tag type is

01:55:15.199 --> 01:55:18.390
uh tag it with processor tag type is export uh specify entity this will be

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400
export uh specify entity this will be

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.390
export uh specify entity this will be usernaming type for us and give some

01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400
usernaming type for us and give some

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.830
usernaming type for us and give some alias and for the import processor

01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840
alias and for the import processor

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.270
alias and for the import processor parent is import abstract also no custom

01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280
parent is import abstract also no custom

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.310
parent is import abstract also no custom PHP code set data converter the one that

01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320
PHP code set data converter the one that

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.950
PHP code set data converter the one that we registered here

01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960
we registered here

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.430
we registered here set strategy

01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440
set strategy

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.629
set strategy the one that we registered here

01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639
the one that we registered here

01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:41.030
the one that we registered here and two tags because we can reuse this

01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040
and two tags because we can reuse this

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:43.109
and two tags because we can reuse this processor for both import and import

01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119
processor for both import and import

01:55:43.119 --> 01:55:46.709
processor for both import and import validation. So we have two tags both are

01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719
validation. So we have two tags both are

01:55:46.719 --> 01:55:48.950
validation. So we have two tags both are processors. First is import second

01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960
processors. First is import second

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.830
processors. First is import second import validation and also we need to

01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840
import validation and also we need to

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.830
import validation and also we need to specify entity. So it will be usernaming

01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840
specify entity. So it will be usernaming

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:57.430
specify entity. So it will be usernaming type for us. Uh and you need to pass an

01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440
type for us. Uh and you need to pass an

01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.910
type for us. Uh and you need to pass an alias. Alias needs to be unique but in

01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920
alias. Alias needs to be unique but in

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.950
alias. Alias needs to be unique but in terms of uh type of the processor. So as

01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960
terms of uh type of the processor. So as

01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:04.550
terms of uh type of the processor. So as you can see here we have basically the

01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560
you can see here we have basically the

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.709
you can see here we have basically the same alias because this is export this

01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719
same alias because this is export this

01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:09.030
same alias because this is export this is import this is import validation.

01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040
is import this is import validation.

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.669
is import this is import validation. Okay. And with this you have working

01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679
Okay. And with this you have working

01:56:11.679 --> 01:56:14.470
Okay. And with this you have working import export in place. You just need to

01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480
import export in place. You just need to

01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.870
import export in place. You just need to have the way to execute it. And for this

01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880
have the way to execute it. And for this

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:19.109
have the way to execute it. And for this we need to do those three elements.

01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119
we need to do those three elements.

01:56:19.119 --> 01:56:22.390
we need to do those three elements. First create configuration

01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400
First create configuration

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.229
First create configuration uh that implements this particular

01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239
uh that implements this particular

01:56:24.239 --> 01:56:26.790
uh that implements this particular interface. And basically you need to

01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800
interface. And basically you need to

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:29.910
interface. And basically you need to return uh field entity class. So here

01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920
return uh field entity class. So here

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.669
return uh field entity class. So here will be usernaming type because we want

01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679
will be usernaming type because we want

01:56:31.679 --> 01:56:34.470
will be usernaming type because we want to import export usernaming type import

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480
to import export usernaming type import

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.629
to import export usernaming type import and export processor aliases the one

01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639
and export processor aliases the one

01:56:36.639 --> 01:56:40.149
and export processor aliases the one that we added here.

01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159
that we added here.

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:43.030
that we added here. Okay.

01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040
Okay.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.629
Okay. And that's it. Then you need to register

01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639
And that's it. Then you need to register

01:56:46.639 --> 01:56:50.470
And that's it. Then you need to register this uh configuration in a DA container.

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480
this uh configuration in a DA container.

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.470
this uh configuration in a DA container. So just tag it that this is import

01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480
So just tag it that this is import

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.350
So just tag it that this is import export configuration and give some alias

01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360
export configuration and give some alias

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.830
export configuration and give some alias and then this alias you will use

01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840
and then this alias you will use

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.589
and then this alias you will use here.

01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599
here.

01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:04.229
here. So you need to edit index html tweak of

01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239
So you need to edit index html tweak of

01:57:04.239 --> 01:57:08.550
So you need to edit index html tweak of our usernaming types.

01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560
our usernaming types.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:11.270
our usernaming types. inside block navigation block uh

01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280
inside block navigation block uh

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.270
inside block navigation block uh navigation buttons block. So this will

01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280
navigation buttons block. So this will

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.030
navigation buttons block. So this will directly go to this part of this page

01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040
directly go to this part of this page

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:18.310
directly go to this part of this page here on the top right

01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320
here on the top right

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.870
here on the top right uh just include the template that we

01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880
uh just include the template that we

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.990
uh just include the template that we have in core bundle and pass the alias

01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000
have in core bundle and pass the alias

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.750
have in core bundle and pass the alias of the configuration file that you

01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760
of the configuration file that you

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:28.550
of the configuration file that you created here. So this will be this alias

01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560
created here. So this will be this alias

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.390
created here. So this will be this alias and with those two elements you should

01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400
and with those two elements you should

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.990
and with those two elements you should be able to see those buttons here and

01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000
be able to see those buttons here and

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.870
be able to see those buttons here and import export should work. Do not forget

01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880
import export should work. Do not forget

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.629
import export should work. Do not forget about consumers because it's happening

01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639
about consumers because it's happening

01:57:38.639 --> 01:57:41.510
about consumers because it's happening through the message queue.

01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520
through the message queue.

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:44.629
through the message queue. Okay. So that's it. Uh so please start.

01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639
Okay. So that's it. Uh so please start.

01:57:44.639 --> 01:57:48.470
Okay. So that's it. Uh so please start. We'll have uh time to finish tomorrow.

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480
We'll have uh time to finish tomorrow.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:51.589
We'll have uh time to finish tomorrow. So yeah, just please start. And again,

01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599
So yeah, just please start. And again,

01:57:51.599 --> 01:57:54.470
So yeah, just please start. And again, please open this from the slides. So

01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480
please open this from the slides. So

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:57.109
please open this from the slides. So you'll have a way to click those links.

01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119
you'll have a way to click those links.

01:57:57.119 --> 01:57:59.750
you'll have a way to click those links. And as always, I'm here just muted. So

01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760
And as always, I'm here just muted. So

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.470
And as always, I'm here just muted. So if in case you need me

01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480
if in case you need me

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:15.189
if in case you need me just unmute yourself and speak.

01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:17.510
Yes.

01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520
Yes.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:21.030
Yes. Uh let's talk on this stuff.

01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040
Uh let's talk on this stuff.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.430
Uh let's talk on this stuff. So it looks like have created anything

01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440
So it looks like have created anything

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.790
So it looks like have created anything that is specific there. Very not there.

01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800
that is specific there. Very not there.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.550
that is specific there. Very not there. there but still cannot see the buttons.

01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560
there but still cannot see the buttons.

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.229
there but still cannot see the buttons. So it's

01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239
So it's

01:58:32.239 --> 01:58:35.669
So it's so I I have created

01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679
so I I have created

01:58:35.679 --> 01:58:38.629
so I I have created uh import export there have specificated

01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639
uh import export there have specificated

01:58:38.639 --> 01:58:42.229
uh import export there have specificated all this converter strategy

01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239
all this converter strategy

01:58:42.239 --> 01:58:43.990
all this converter strategy and

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000
and

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.229
and okay I'm just briefly checking

01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239
okay I'm just briefly checking

01:58:46.239 --> 01:58:50.070
okay I'm just briefly checking everything

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.990
actually this one doesn't work

01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000
actually this one doesn't work

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.790
actually this one doesn't work correctly. Uh yeah,

01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800
correctly. Uh yeah,

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.709
correctly. Uh yeah, but uh I don't think it's the reason why

01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719
but uh I don't think it's the reason why

01:58:58.719 --> 01:59:00.470
but uh I don't think it's the reason why it's not appearing.

01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480
it's not appearing.

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:02.629
it's not appearing. Yeah, but let's check everything step by

01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639
Yeah, but let's check everything step by

01:59:02.639 --> 01:59:06.310
Yeah, but let's check everything step by step and then we'll

01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320
step and then we'll

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.629
step and then we'll see.

01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639
see.

01:59:08.639 --> 01:59:11.030
see. Okay, then you have this auto import

01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040
Okay, then you have this auto import

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.990
Okay, then you have this auto import export configuration.

01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000
export configuration.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.510
export configuration. Um

01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520
Um

01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:18.790
Um can you show me your provider

01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800
can you show me your provider

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:24.310
can you show me your provider configuration provider? Yes. Um,

01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320
configuration provider? Yes. Um,

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.229
configuration provider? Yes. Um, okay. And the

01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239
okay. And the

01:59:28.239 --> 01:59:30.870
okay. And the I didn't entity

01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880
I didn't entity

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:33.109
I didn't entity there was not in the sample. So the

01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119
there was not in the sample. So the

01:59:33.119 --> 01:59:36.229
there was not in the sample. So the fields I mean it's the position and the

01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239
fields I mean it's the position and the

01:59:36.239 --> 01:59:36.709
fields I mean it's the position and the type.

01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719
type.

01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:38.629
type. No, you don't need to do this. You don't

01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639
No, you don't need to do this. You don't

01:59:38.639 --> 01:59:40.709
No, you don't need to do this. You don't need to do this.

01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719
need to do this.

01:59:40.719 --> 01:59:50.550
need to do this. Okay.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:56.310
Okay. And you registered services where

01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320
Okay. And you registered services where

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.229
Okay. And you registered services where uh because you register services in

01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239
uh because you register services in

01:59:58.239 --> 02:00:00.470
uh because you register services in services yaml file you can divide it

02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480
services yaml file you can divide it

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.669
services yaml file you can divide it into separate file but uh this needs to

02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679
into separate file but uh this needs to

02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:06.310
into separate file but uh this needs to be on the same level as resource.

02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320
be on the same level as resource.

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:08.950
be on the same level as resource. Actually I can see there is an extra tab

02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960
Actually I can see there is an extra tab

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.350
Actually I can see there is an extra tab probably that is the issue as well. But

02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360
probably that is the issue as well. But

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.430
probably that is the issue as well. But you still need to load those services.

02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440
you still need to load those services.

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.910
you still need to load those services. So same as you load services YAML file

02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920
So same as you load services YAML file

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.830
So same as you load services YAML file like this.

02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840
like this.

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.870
like this. Yeah,

02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880
Yeah,

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:21.510
Yeah, that's what I was expecting cuz I I I

02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520
that's what I was expecting cuz I I I

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.149
that's what I was expecting cuz I I I was not sure. So I saw that this import

02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159
was not sure. So I saw that this import

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:26.870
was not sure. So I saw that this import were doing this stuff for me.

02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880
were doing this stuff for me.

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:30.629
were doing this stuff for me. Okay. So in Aura we have this um so

02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639
Okay. So in Aura we have this um so

02:00:30.639 --> 02:00:32.550
Okay. So in Aura we have this um so everything actually it's a service. So

02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560
everything actually it's a service. So

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.109
everything actually it's a service. So you need to put it in services yam but

02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119
you need to put it in services yam but

02:00:35.119 --> 02:00:37.589
you need to put it in services yam but because we don't want to this services y

02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599
because we don't want to this services y

02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:39.750
because we don't want to this services y to be very very very big we just always

02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760
to be very very very big we just always

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.149
to be very very very big we just always divide it into separate file and we

02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159
divide it into separate file and we

02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:44.229
divide it into separate file and we normally call it input textbook yam so

02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239
normally call it input textbook yam so

02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:46.229
normally call it input textbook yam so you just need to load it with the DI

02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239
you just need to load it with the DI

02:00:46.239 --> 02:00:48.149
you just need to load it with the DI extension you have the dependency

02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159
extension you have the dependency

02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:50.070
extension you have the dependency injection extension the file that it's

02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080
injection extension the file that it's

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.870
injection extension the file that it's loading services y

02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880
loading services y

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.550
loading services y can you open dependency injection

02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560
can you open dependency injection

02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.070
can you open dependency injection directory in your just

02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080
directory in your just

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.109
directory in your just just open the dependency injection

02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119
just open the dependency injection

02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:01.990
just open the dependency injection directory

02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000
directory

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.669
directory And here is the file that is loading

02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679
And here is the file that is loading

02:01:03.679 --> 02:01:05.430
And here is the file that is loading services. So you also need to load

02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440
services. So you also need to load

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:07.669
services. So you also need to load import export. And it's good if those

02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679
import export. And it's good if those

02:01:07.679 --> 02:01:10.310
import export. And it's good if those import export will be not inside or subd

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320
import export will be not inside or subd

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.149
import export will be not inside or subd directory because that's not a file.

02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159
directory because that's not a file.

02:01:12.159 --> 02:01:14.229
directory because that's not a file. That's basically

02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239
That's basically

02:01:14.239 --> 02:01:18.310
That's basically cell phone file.

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.950
So just move the import export one

02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960
So just move the import export one

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.270
So just move the import export one above and

02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280
above and

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.310
above and okay and load it uh inside the training

02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320
okay and load it uh inside the training

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.629
okay and load it uh inside the training username. Those services need to be

02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639
username. Those services need to be

02:01:30.639 --> 02:01:32.629
username. Those services need to be registered as well.

02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639
registered as well.

02:01:32.639 --> 02:01:34.629
registered as well. But those services will be registered.

02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639
But those services will be registered.

02:01:34.639 --> 02:01:37.109
But those services will be registered. So this is exactly the same file as

02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119
So this is exactly the same file as

02:01:37.119 --> 02:01:39.350
So this is exactly the same file as services. Yam you just created a

02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360
services. Yam you just created a

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.830
services. Yam you just created a separate file.

02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840
separate file.

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:45.030
separate file. I just wondering so in the sample I I've

02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040
I just wondering so in the sample I I've

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.350
I just wondering so in the sample I I've used from there I believe. No not there

02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360
used from there I believe. No not there

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.390
used from there I believe. No not there but

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.870
the text example there I believe.

02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880
the text example there I believe.

02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:57.510
the text example there I believe. Mhm.

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520
Mhm.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.270
Mhm. Yeah. So in protect okay it's not

02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280
Yeah. So in protect okay it's not

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.910
Yeah. So in protect okay it's not yes it's in resources config and this is

02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920
yes it's in resources config and this is

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.030
yes it's in resources config and this is basically because services yaml is very

02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040
basically because services yaml is very

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.750
basically because services yaml is very big. So we just divide those services in

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760
big. So we just divide those services in

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:12.470
big. So we just divide those services in multiple files but this is exactly the

02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480
multiple files but this is exactly the

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:14.390
multiple files but this is exactly the same file as services yaml.

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400
same file as services yaml.

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.109
same file as services yaml. I got

02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119
I got

02:02:15.119 --> 02:02:16.470
I got so you can even put all those

02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480
so you can even put all those

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:18.550
so you can even put all those definitions in services y if you want.

02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560
definitions in services y if you want.

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.310
definitions in services y if you want. But basically it's good to have them in

02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320
But basically it's good to have them in

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.189
But basically it's good to have them in separate one. That's why we always have

02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199
separate one. That's why we always have

02:02:23.199 --> 02:02:24.950
separate one. That's why we always have it in separate file. That's why in the

02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960
it in separate file. That's why in the

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.990
it in separate file. That's why in the example you saw it as a separate file.

02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000
example you saw it as a separate file.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.430
example you saw it as a separate file. That makes sense then

02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440
That makes sense then

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.870
That makes sense then cuz I was how it's supposed to. So I I

02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880
cuz I was how it's supposed to. So I I

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.350
cuz I was how it's supposed to. So I I did miss this. It's not in a because I

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360
did miss this. It's not in a because I

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.510
did miss this. It's not in a because I thought it's on a but it's not the

02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520
thought it's on a but it's not the

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.589
thought it's on a but it's not the example

02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599
example

02:02:41.599 --> 02:02:44.550
example and I was wondering probably already

02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560
and I was wondering probably already

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.669
and I was wondering probably already creating services for them for this but

02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679
creating services for them for this but

02:02:47.679 --> 02:03:09.589
creating services for them for this but it's not the aura stuff.

02:03:09.599 --> 02:03:11.430
Yeah, now it's there.

02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440
Yeah, now it's there.

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.790
Yeah, now it's there. Mhm.

02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800
Mhm.

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.070
Mhm. And then I need to configure the fields

02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080
And then I need to configure the fields

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.350
And then I need to configure the fields for understood.

02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360
for understood.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.589
for understood. You don't need to. You will have some

02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599
You don't need to. You will have some

02:03:19.599 --> 02:03:21.430
You don't need to. You will have some default values. So by default everything

02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440
default values. So by default everything

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.270
default values. So by default everything will be exported and the order will be

02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280
will be exported and the order will be

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:27.750
will be exported and the order will be I'm not sure what order you will have

02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760
I'm not sure what order you will have

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:30.390
I'm not sure what order you will have some custom order and hithers will be

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400
some custom order and hithers will be

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.149
some custom order and hithers will be taken from translations. So

02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159
taken from translations. So

02:03:32.159 --> 02:03:33.750
taken from translations. So yeah, I don't think it will be there

02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760
yeah, I don't think it will be there

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.790
yeah, I don't think it will be there because I don't have the consumers.

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:41.109
Probably I can run it separately, but

02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119
Probably I can run it separately, but

02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:47.990
Probably I can run it separately, but it's not conf yet.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.470
And to run consumers,

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:57.589
I know

02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599
I know

02:03:57.599 --> 02:03:59.910
I know uh this is only consume. So it's a

02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920
uh this is only consume. So it's a

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.910
uh this is only consume. So it's a message Q consume. You can grab by

02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920
message Q consume. You can grab by

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:05.109
message Q consume. You can grab by consume

02:04:05.119 --> 02:04:14.629
or a message key consume. This one

02:04:14.639 --> 02:04:17.270
and preferably if you execute this is

02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280
and preferably if you execute this is

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.109
and preferably if you execute this is happening always this uh when you

02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119
happening always this uh when you

02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:21.030
happening always this uh when you starting something because you probably

02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040
starting something because you probably

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.669
starting something because you probably stopped consumers. So after you stop

02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679
stopped consumers. So after you stop

02:04:23.679 --> 02:04:28.390
stopped consumers. So after you stop manually or just look out then

02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400
manually or just look out then

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.030
manually or just look out then uh if you execute this command can you

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040
uh if you execute this command can you

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.470
uh if you execute this command can you execute it with double v so minus vv so

02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480
execute it with double v so minus vv so

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.750
execute it with double v so minus vv so then you will have some

02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760
then you will have some

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.910
then you will have some actually we already have some error

02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920
actually we already have some error

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:44.310
actually we already have some error cannot run jobs in

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:47.990
too much too much vi

02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000
too much too much vi

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.229
too much too much vi okay can you stop it and just

02:04:54.239 --> 02:04:57.350
Okay, it's still doing something. You

02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360
Okay, it's still doing something. You

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.430
Okay, it's still doing something. You probably had a lot of messages.

02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440
probably had a lot of messages.

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:06.629
probably had a lot of messages. Yeah.

02:05:06.639 --> 02:05:09.030
I had the same when I executed mine

02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040
I had the same when I executed mine

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.109
I had the same when I executed mine during while I was sharing screen. I

02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119
during while I was sharing screen. I

02:05:11.119 --> 02:05:24.870
during while I was sharing screen. I also had some messages on message c

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.470
Okay.

02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480
Okay.

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:34.570
Okay. Uh, can you check now the email or this

02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:38.790
[Music]

02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800
[Music]

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:39.589
[Music] under data

02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599
under data

02:05:39.599 --> 02:05:40.550
under data folder

02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560
folder

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:44.550
folder v data import export. Okay. It looks

02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560
v data import export. Okay. It looks

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:46.070
v data import export. Okay. It looks like

02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:46.080
like

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:50.390
like we're right. Mhm. Yeah. So that's this

02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400
we're right. Mhm. Yeah. So that's this

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:53.270
we're right. Mhm. Yeah. So that's this and those fields which we had there like

02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280
and those fields which we had there like

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:57.510
and those fields which we had there like so it's not necessarily to to set up the

02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520
so it's not necessarily to to set up the

02:05:57.520 --> 02:06:00.149
so it's not necessarily to to set up the entity for each field which export not

02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159
entity for each field which export not

02:06:00.159 --> 02:06:03.189
entity for each field which export not to export. So I thought you told the ID

02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199
to export. So I thought you told the ID

02:06:03.199 --> 02:06:06.229
to export. So I thought you told the ID should should not be exported

02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239
should should not be exported

02:06:06.239 --> 02:06:08.709
should should not be exported actually exported you can export but

02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719
actually exported you can export but

02:06:08.719 --> 02:06:11.189
actually exported you can export but when you import you can also import with

02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199
when you import you can also import with

02:06:11.199 --> 02:06:12.870
when you import you can also import with ID but doesn't it doesn't make sense

02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880
ID but doesn't it doesn't make sense

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.310
ID but doesn't it doesn't make sense because this is supposed to be

02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320
because this is supposed to be

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.109
because this is supposed to be automatically generated value. So but it

02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119
automatically generated value. So but it

02:06:17.119 --> 02:06:19.030
automatically generated value. So but it can be in the export if you need but if

02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040
can be in the export if you need but if

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.030
can be in the export if you need but if you want to omit it. Yes. This is

02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040
you want to omit it. Yes. This is

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.870
you want to omit it. Yes. This is actually example where you can use this

02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880
actually example where you can use this

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:25.189
actually example where you can use this at config field annotation and put this

02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199
at config field annotation and put this

02:06:25.199 --> 02:06:28.390
at config field annotation and put this configuration. Uh

02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400
configuration. Uh

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:29.030
configuration. Uh yeah right

02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040
yeah right

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.189
yeah right exported false or something like this.

02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199
exported false or something like this.

02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:34.470
exported false or something like this. And by the way if if consumers working

02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480
And by the way if if consumers working

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:37.669
And by the way if if consumers working as normally so those consumers should be

02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679
as normally so those consumers should be

02:06:37.679 --> 02:06:40.470
as normally so those consumers should be started as the chrome or it should be

02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480
started as the chrome or it should be

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.830
started as the chrome or it should be started

02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840
started

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:44.149
started no that's a separate CLI command. So you

02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159
no that's a separate CLI command. So you

02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:46.069
no that's a separate CLI command. So you just started with this particular

02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079
just started with this particular

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:48.069
just started with this particular command and locally you will do it

02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079
command and locally you will do it

02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:50.550
command and locally you will do it manually on the server there will be a

02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560
manually on the server there will be a

02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:51.910
manually on the server there will be a supervisor

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920
supervisor

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:53.990
supervisor configured to execute this particular

02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000
configured to execute this particular

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.210
configured to execute this particular command.

02:06:55.210 --> 02:06:55.220
command.

02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:59.589
command. [Music]

02:06:59.599 --> 02:07:04.870
I got him. Okay then I switching to the

02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880
I got him. Okay then I switching to the

02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:07.189
I got him. Okay then I switching to the optional part.

02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199
optional part.

02:07:07.199 --> 02:07:24.310
optional part. Okay.

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.830
Uh I have a question. Mhm.

02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840
Uh I have a question. Mhm.

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:32.069
Uh I have a question. Mhm. Um what I see that this import export

02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079
Um what I see that this import export

02:07:32.079 --> 02:07:36.310
Um what I see that this import export file configuration is in uh config

02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320
file configuration is in uh config

02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.310
file configuration is in uh config directory. Uh but some

02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320
directory. Uh but some

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:43.270
directory. Uh but some uh so the question why it's not in aura

02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280
uh so the question why it's not in aura

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.390
uh so the question why it's not in aura usually you showing us configuration are

02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400
usually you showing us configuration are

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.069
usually you showing us configuration are ino directory

02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079
ino directory

02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:51.109
ino directory but that's not oral uh configuration or

02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119
but that's not oral uh configuration or

02:07:51.119 --> 02:07:53.109
but that's not oral uh configuration or anything specific to oro it's you are

02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119
anything specific to oro it's you are

02:07:53.119 --> 02:07:55.669
anything specific to oro it's you are just registering services in a DI

02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679
just registering services in a DI

02:07:55.679 --> 02:07:58.390
just registering services in a DI container in a symphony DIA container so

02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400
container in a symphony DIA container so

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:01.189
container in a symphony DIA container so you can put it directly to services yam

02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199
you can put it directly to services yam

02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:04.069
you can put it directly to services yam if you prefer we internally always

02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079
if you prefer we internally always

02:08:04.079 --> 02:08:06.870
if you prefer we internally always create a separate file for it because we

02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880
create a separate file for it because we

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.470
create a separate file for it because we want to have those definitions in

02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480
want to have those definitions in

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.950
want to have those definitions in separate file. But this file is exactly

02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960
separate file. But this file is exactly

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.990
separate file. But this file is exactly the same as services.yaml.

02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000
the same as services.yaml.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.149
the same as services.yaml. You can have multiple files like this

02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159
You can have multiple files like this

02:08:16.159 --> 02:08:18.069
You can have multiple files like this call them differently. You just need to

02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079
call them differently. You just need to

02:08:18.079 --> 02:08:20.870
call them differently. You just need to remember to load it inside the

02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880
remember to load it inside the

02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:24.470
remember to load it inside the dependency injection extension file. We

02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480
dependency injection extension file. We

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.229
dependency injection extension file. We have this PHP file that is loading

02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239
have this PHP file that is loading

02:08:26.239 --> 02:08:28.550
have this PHP file that is loading services and you need to additionally

02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560
services and you need to additionally

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:32.229
services and you need to additionally load this one.

02:08:32.239 --> 02:08:34.709
Okay. Also and another question about

02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719
Okay. Also and another question about

02:08:34.719 --> 02:08:38.709
Okay. Also and another question about that tags. Um

02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719
that tags. Um

02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:42.629
that tags. Um how how can I found uh where they are

02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639
how how can I found uh where they are

02:08:42.639 --> 02:08:45.109
how how can I found uh where they are that used?

02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119
that used?

02:08:45.119 --> 02:08:48.709
that used? Um it's not clear for me what values

02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719
Um it's not clear for me what values

02:08:48.719 --> 02:08:54.229
Um it's not clear for me what values said there and there in text and or just

02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239
said there and there in text and or just

02:08:54.239 --> 02:08:57.430
said there and there in text and or just follow the examples.

02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440
follow the examples.

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:00.790
follow the examples. So basically in each topic I was showing

02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800
So basically in each topic I was showing

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.589
So basically in each topic I was showing you classes and there were some tags

02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599
you classes and there were some tags

02:09:03.599 --> 02:09:05.830
you classes and there were some tags that you need to uh register those

02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840
that you need to uh register those

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:09.109
that you need to uh register those services with uh for oral application or

02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119
services with uh for oral application or

02:09:09.119 --> 02:09:11.990
services with uh for oral application or symfony application to register to

02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000
symfony application to register to

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.990
symfony application to register to recognize those services as some

02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000
recognize those services as some

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.629
recognize those services as some particular elements. So I don't think we

02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639
particular elements. So I don't think we

02:09:16.639 --> 02:09:20.069
particular elements. So I don't think we have any list like all the tags and to

02:09:20.069 --> 02:09:20.079
have any list like all the tags and to

02:09:20.079 --> 02:09:22.550
have any list like all the tags and to which part of functionality they they

02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560
which part of functionality they they

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.470
which part of functionality they they they go. we don't have documentation in

02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480
they go. we don't have documentation in

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.030
they go. we don't have documentation in this uh format. We rather have topic by

02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040
this uh format. We rather have topic by

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:33.270
this uh format. We rather have topic by topic like I was showing you like import

02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280
topic like I was showing you like import

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.270
topic like I was showing you like import export and then we'll have API

02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280
export and then we'll have API

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.030
export and then we'll have API processors and in each topic like each

02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040
processors and in each topic like each

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:44.629
processors and in each topic like each service has its own tag. So um

02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639
service has its own tag. So um

02:09:44.639 --> 02:09:47.589
service has its own tag. So um those tag is actually up to us. So when

02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599
those tag is actually up to us. So when

02:09:47.599 --> 02:09:49.750
those tag is actually up to us. So when we created implementation of import

02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760
we created implementation of import

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.149
we created implementation of import export, we decided to name the pro

02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159
export, we decided to name the pro

02:09:54.159 --> 02:09:57.189
export, we decided to name the pro processor tag with this particular tag.

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199
processor tag with this particular tag.

02:09:57.199 --> 02:10:00.550
processor tag with this particular tag. Uh so there's no other way just to kind

02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560
Uh so there's no other way just to kind

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.109
Uh so there's no other way just to kind of remember it or check in code

02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119
of remember it or check in code

02:10:05.119 --> 02:10:07.830
of remember it or check in code later when you will want to create this

02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840
later when you will want to create this

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.830
later when you will want to create this again. So check in code what is the

02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840
again. So check in code what is the

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.149
again. So check in code what is the exact tag

02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159
exact tag

02:10:12.159 --> 02:10:14.310
exact tag basically by this tag. And our

02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320
basically by this tag. And our

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.069
basically by this tag. And our functionality works with the service.

02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079
functionality works with the service.

02:10:18.079 --> 02:10:20.069
functionality works with the service. And

02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079
And

02:10:20.079 --> 02:10:24.470
And you can list you can use debug um you

02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480
you can list you can use debug um you

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.750
you can list you can use debug um you can use the cli command to debug um

02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760
can use the cli command to debug um

02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:30.390
can use the cli command to debug um container to list for example all

02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400
container to list for example all

02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:32.629
container to list for example all services that are tagged with this

02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639
services that are tagged with this

02:10:32.639 --> 02:10:35.510
services that are tagged with this particular tag. So you'll have a list of

02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520
particular tag. So you'll have a list of

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:39.189
particular tag. So you'll have a list of all the import processors for example.

02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199
all the import processors for example.

02:10:39.199 --> 02:10:41.109
all the import processors for example. This you can also do.

02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119
This you can also do.

02:10:41.119 --> 02:10:43.830
This you can also do. Yeah. But uh as I've understood uh tag

02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840
Yeah. But uh as I've understood uh tag

02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.589
Yeah. But uh as I've understood uh tag has also functional

02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599
has also functional

02:10:47.599 --> 02:10:51.589
has also functional meaning. So it is used value is not just

02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599
meaning. So it is used value is not just

02:10:51.599 --> 02:10:53.990
meaning. So it is used value is not just uh for information or

02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000
uh for information or

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.830
uh for information or uh no later our bundles uh we can by the

02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840
uh no later our bundles uh we can by the

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.030
uh no later our bundles uh we can by the stag fetch all the services that have

02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040
stag fetch all the services that have

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.589
stag fetch all the services that have the stag and then for example register

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599
the stag and then for example register

02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:05.830
the stag and then for example register them somewhere. For example, if we'll

02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840
them somewhere. For example, if we'll

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.830
them somewhere. For example, if we'll have a service that should keep

02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840
have a service that should keep

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.629
have a service that should keep collection of all the import providers,

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639
collection of all the import providers,

02:11:10.639 --> 02:11:13.589
collection of all the import providers, then we can basically get a container,

02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599
then we can basically get a container,

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.510
then we can basically get a container, get all the services tagged with this

02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520
get all the services tagged with this

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:18.069
get all the services tagged with this tag and we'll have the list of all the

02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079
tag and we'll have the list of all the

02:11:18.079 --> 02:11:21.990
tag and we'll have the list of all the uh import

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.750
export processors.

02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760
export processors.

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.669
export processors. So it's

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679
So it's

02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:27.910
So it's like compile collections.

02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920
like compile collections.

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.510
like compile collections. Yeah. So this isformational plus this is

02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520
Yeah. So this isformational plus this is

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.790
Yeah. So this isformational plus this is probably and for sure used somewhere in

02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800
probably and for sure used somewhere in

02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:37.270
probably and for sure used somewhere in core bundles because those core bundles

02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280
core bundles because those core bundles

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.189
core bundles because those core bundles recognize the service as a processor

02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199
recognize the service as a processor

02:11:39.199 --> 02:11:45.350
recognize the service as a processor because of the tag.

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.990
Same as for all the symfony elements

02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000
Same as for all the symfony elements

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.109
Same as for all the symfony elements also like you create symfony form type

02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119
also like you create symfony form type

02:11:51.119 --> 02:11:53.270
also like you create symfony form type then the form type is also tagged with

02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280
then the form type is also tagged with

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.189
then the form type is also tagged with some particular tag because later

02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199
some particular tag because later

02:11:55.199 --> 02:11:57.510
some particular tag because later symphon just takes all those services

02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:57.520
symphon just takes all those services

02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.390
symphon just takes all those services tagged with this tag and treats them as

02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400
tagged with this tag and treats them as

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.430
tagged with this tag and treats them as as as form types but this is always

02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440
as as form types but this is always

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.990
as as form types but this is always connected to some functionality but this

02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000
connected to some functionality but this

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.990
connected to some functionality but this will be based on the tag so

02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000
will be based on the tag so

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:26.550
will be based on the tag so it's hard to prepare this Please

02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.149
Vladimir

02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159
Vladimir

02:12:28.159 --> 02:12:30.950
Vladimir I actually can show you how this

02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960
I actually can show you how this

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.109
I actually can show you how this particular tag is used.

02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119
particular tag is used.

02:12:35.119 --> 02:12:36.550
particular tag is used. Okay.

02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560
Okay.

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:38.870
Okay. So maybe those will clear this

02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880
So maybe those will clear this

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.990
So maybe those will clear this particular tag. Uh so for the import

02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000
particular tag. Uh so for the import

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.790
particular tag. Uh so for the import export um first we do have a registry

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800
export um first we do have a registry

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.109
export um first we do have a registry where you and you need to register your

02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119
where you and you need to register your

02:12:47.119 --> 02:12:49.189
where you and you need to register your processor inside this registry because

02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199
processor inside this registry because

02:12:49.199 --> 02:12:51.510
processor inside this registry because this registry keeps the collection of

02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520
this registry keeps the collection of

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:54.950
this registry keeps the collection of all the processors and later uh when we

02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960
all the processors and later uh when we

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:56.790
all the processors and later uh when we are fetching some particular we're

02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800
are fetching some particular we're

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.910
are fetching some particular we're fetching it by the entity and by the

02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920
fetching it by the entity and by the

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:02.470
fetching it by the entity and by the type. So we actually need to register

02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480
type. So we actually need to register

02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.550
type. So we actually need to register all the processors

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560
all the processors

02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:07.830
all the processors and this is happening uh here. So we

02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840
and this is happening uh here. So we

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.310
and this is happening uh here. So we have register processor method and it's

02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320
have register processor method and it's

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.030
have register processor method and it's actually executed uh in the compiler

02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040
actually executed uh in the compiler

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.589
actually executed uh in the compiler pass. So when the dependency injection

02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599
pass. So when the dependency injection

02:13:15.599 --> 02:13:18.629
pass. So when the dependency injection container is built, we are fetching all

02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639
container is built, we are fetching all

02:13:18.639 --> 02:13:23.270
container is built, we are fetching all the services tagged with this tag. So

02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280
the services tagged with this tag. So

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.189
the services tagged with this tag. So we're taking all those services that

02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199
we're taking all those services that

02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:30.470
we're taking all those services that have this tag and for each we are uh

02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480
have this tag and for each we are uh

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:33.109
have this tag and for each we are uh executing this register processor method

02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119
executing this register processor method

02:13:33.119 --> 02:13:36.390
executing this register processor method in our processor registry. This is how

02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400
in our processor registry. This is how

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.629
in our processor registry. This is how all those processors, all those ser

02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639
all those processors, all those ser

02:13:38.639 --> 02:13:40.629
all those processors, all those ser services that are tagged to be

02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639
services that are tagged to be

02:13:40.639 --> 02:13:44.470
services that are tagged to be processors are getting to our processor

02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480
processors are getting to our processor

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:47.910
processors are getting to our processor registry and we have collection of all

02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920
registry and we have collection of all

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:50.870
registry and we have collection of all and by entity. Okay. Now we have all

02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880
and by entity. Okay. Now we have all

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:53.750
and by entity. Okay. Now we have all those processors and later

02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760
those processors and later

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.350
those processors and later um

02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360
um

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.470
um you can we are just fetching appropriate

02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480
you can we are just fetching appropriate

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.750
you can we are just fetching appropriate processor from this processor registry

02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760
processor from this processor registry

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.830
processor from this processor registry by for example entity and type. Okay. So

02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840
by for example entity and type. Okay. So

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.669
by for example entity and type. Okay. So this is how this tag is used. If your

02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679
this is how this tag is used. If your

02:14:07.679 --> 02:14:10.629
this is how this tag is used. If your processor is not tagged with this tag

02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639
processor is not tagged with this tag

02:14:10.639 --> 02:14:12.629
processor is not tagged with this tag then it will not be recognized as a

02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639
then it will not be recognized as a

02:14:12.639 --> 02:14:14.870
then it will not be recognized as a processor here and you not will be

02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880
processor here and you not will be

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:17.189
processor here and you not will be registered will will not be registered.

02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199
registered will will not be registered.

02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:19.109
registered will will not be registered. So you'll not be able to use it as a

02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119
So you'll not be able to use it as a

02:14:19.119 --> 02:14:22.870
So you'll not be able to use it as a import export processor.

02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:26.470
Okay. So all these texts are a part of

02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480
Okay. So all these texts are a part of

02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.990
Okay. So all these texts are a part of the comp compilation process. Uh I'd say

02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000
the comp compilation process. Uh I'd say

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.310
the comp compilation process. Uh I'd say if I need to find any tech I should go

02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320
if I need to find any tech I should go

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:35.189
if I need to find any tech I should go to dependency injection compiler and

02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199
to dependency injection compiler and

02:14:35.199 --> 02:14:36.310
to dependency injection compiler and very high

02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320
very high

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.189
very high will be to easier will will be to find

02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199
will be to easier will will be to find

02:14:39.199 --> 02:14:41.270
will be to easier will will be to find another service that is also import

02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280
another service that is also import

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.229
another service that is also import export processor and check tag there

02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239
export processor and check tag there

02:14:44.239 --> 02:14:46.470
export processor and check tag there because not always everything is comp in

02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480
because not always everything is comp in

02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:49.910
because not always everything is comp in compiler pass sometimes those tagged are

02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920
compiler pass sometimes those tagged are

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.229
compiler pass sometimes those tagged are tags are and collections because here

02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239
tags are and collections because here

02:14:52.239 --> 02:14:54.069
tags are and collections because here while registering we're doing some

02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079
while registering we're doing some

02:14:54.079 --> 02:14:56.310
while registering we're doing some additional data so we need to call this

02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320
additional data so we need to call this

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:59.589
additional data so we need to call this methods to register uh processor

02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599
methods to register uh processor

02:14:59.599 --> 02:15:01.589
methods to register uh processor Okay. But sometimes if you just need to

02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599
Okay. But sometimes if you just need to

02:15:01.599 --> 02:15:04.229
Okay. But sometimes if you just need to pass a collection of taxed services as

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239
pass a collection of taxed services as

02:15:04.239 --> 02:15:06.069
pass a collection of taxed services as they are because here we're doing some

02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079
they are because here we're doing some

02:15:06.079 --> 02:15:12.470
they are because here we're doing some additional logic, you can also um

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.189
use it this way. Okay. So uh as a fourth

02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199
use it this way. Okay. So uh as a fourth

02:15:17.199 --> 02:15:19.990
use it this way. Okay. So uh as a fourth argument of my controller in this

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000
argument of my controller in this

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.189
argument of my controller in this particular class, I am passing all the

02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199
particular class, I am passing all the

02:15:23.199 --> 02:15:25.430
particular class, I am passing all the services tagged with this tag. this

02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440
services tagged with this tag. this

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.669
services tagged with this tag. this annotation exclamation mark and tagged

02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679
annotation exclamation mark and tagged

02:15:27.679 --> 02:15:30.229
annotation exclamation mark and tagged iterator iterator gives us the

02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239
iterator iterator gives us the

02:15:30.239 --> 02:15:32.709
iterator iterator gives us the collection. So basically yeah the

02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719
collection. So basically yeah the

02:15:32.719 --> 02:15:34.629
collection. So basically yeah the collection so all the services tagged

02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639
collection so all the services tagged

02:15:34.639 --> 02:15:36.709
collection so all the services tagged with this tag. So this is another way of

02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719
with this tag. So this is another way of

02:15:36.719 --> 02:15:40.149
with this tag. So this is another way of using a tag. So actually that's why I

02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159
using a tag. So actually that's why I

02:15:40.159 --> 02:15:43.109
using a tag. So actually that's why I said that is better if you go topic by

02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119
said that is better if you go topic by

02:15:43.119 --> 02:15:45.189
said that is better if you go topic by topic. So in import export I just told

02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199
topic. So in import export I just told

02:15:45.199 --> 02:15:46.870
topic. So in import export I just told you that for the processor you need to

02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880
you that for the processor you need to

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:49.109
you that for the processor you need to tag it with some tag. So next time you

02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119
tag it with some tag. So next time you

02:15:49.119 --> 02:15:50.870
tag it with some tag. So next time you will want to do it just find another

02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880
will want to do it just find another

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.229
will want to do it just find another import export processor and check what

02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239
import export processor and check what

02:15:54.239 --> 02:15:57.350
import export processor and check what tag it's using because here you can just

02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360
tag it's using because here you can just

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.669
tag it's using because here you can just sometimes just not not find

02:16:01.679 --> 02:16:04.390
here one two three four and this is one

02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400
here one two three four and this is one

02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:08.709
here one two three four and this is one two three four and this is basically

02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719
two three four and this is basically

02:16:08.719 --> 02:16:15.030
two three four and this is basically yeah some array of elements that's

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:27.189
All right,

02:16:27.199 --> 02:16:29.669
guys. Do you have any questions

02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679
guys. Do you have any questions

02:16:29.679 --> 02:16:32.790
guys. Do you have any questions right now? We'll have uh some more time

02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800
right now? We'll have uh some more time

02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:35.030
right now? We'll have uh some more time tomorrow to finish the practice, but do

02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040
tomorrow to finish the practice, but do

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:37.030
tomorrow to finish the practice, but do you have any questions

02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040
you have any questions

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:45.110
you have any questions uh in this particular moment?

02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:48.389
Nothing for me.

02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399
Nothing for me.

02:16:48.399 --> 02:16:50.389
Nothing for me. Okay. So, thank you so much for today

02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399
Okay. So, thank you so much for today

02:16:50.399 --> 02:16:52.150
Okay. So, thank you so much for today and yeah, see you tomorrow. We're going

02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160
and yeah, see you tomorrow. We're going

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.790
and yeah, see you tomorrow. We're going to continue this practice. So, yep.

02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800
to continue this practice. So, yep.

02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:59.429
to continue this practice. So, yep. Thank you. See you.
