persons who are um interacting with the back office uh setting up required

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319
back office uh setting up required

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.110
back office uh setting up required relations uh filling uh required

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120
relations uh filling uh required

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.950
relations uh filling uh required configuration uh for the application and

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960
configuration uh for the application and

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.950
configuration uh for the application and u yeah then u

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960
u yeah then u

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.430
u yeah then u all those basically all those settings

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440
all those basically all those settings

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.990
all those basically all those settings and all those configurations they are uh

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000
and all those configurations they are uh

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.909
and all those configurations they are uh then the main idea is to be used uh on a

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919
then the main idea is to be used uh on a

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.990
then the main idea is to be used uh on a storefront uh during purchase process

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000
storefront uh during purchase process

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.870
storefront uh during purchase process and this part is uh available for

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880
and this part is uh available for

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.790
and this part is uh available for limited amount of people u

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800
limited amount of people u

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.830
limited amount of people u I'd say it is uh fully well protected

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840
I'd say it is uh fully well protected

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.950
I'd say it is uh fully well protected and we will uh uh cover what kind of

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960
and we will uh uh cover what kind of

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.150
and we will uh uh cover what kind of protection is meant uh uh for the back

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160
protection is meant uh uh for the back

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.749
protection is meant uh uh for the back office uh in the while talking about

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759
office uh in the while talking about

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.390
office uh in the while talking about back office uh uh for the back office

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400
back office uh uh for the back office

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.350
back office uh uh for the back office functionality matters more than

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360
functionality matters more than

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.870
functionality matters more than performance uh because Um this is the

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880
performance uh because Um this is the

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.309
performance uh because Um this is the place where you uh set up different uh

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319
place where you uh set up different uh

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.510
place where you uh set up different uh so actually this

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520
so actually this

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.589
so actually this back office operates with large amount

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599
back office operates with large amount

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:38.469
back office operates with large amount of uh data and you need to set it up

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479
of uh data and you need to set it up

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.350
of uh data and you need to set it up properly. Uh some computations take

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360
properly. Uh some computations take

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.990
properly. Uh some computations take place. Uh so uh how it uh functions uh

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000
place. Uh so uh how it uh functions uh

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.350
place. Uh so uh how it uh functions uh it matters more than uh how quickly the

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360
it matters more than uh how quickly the

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.830
it matters more than uh how quickly the requests are uh processed.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840
requests are uh processed.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.990
requests are uh processed. uh when you will be checking

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000
uh when you will be checking

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.790
uh when you will be checking documentation for instance of uh or

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800
documentation for instance of uh or

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.390
documentation for instance of uh or commerce uh sometimes uh it is also back

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400
commerce uh sometimes uh it is also back

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.469
commerce uh sometimes uh it is also back office is also referred as a management

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479
office is also referred as a management

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.150
office is also referred as a management console uh or as a back end so these are

uh the same terms so I've mentioned one part uh this is back office uh of

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319
part uh this is back office uh of

part uh this is back office uh of automous application where you have you

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639
automous application where you have you

automous application where you have you are setting up um and uh another part

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080
are setting up um and uh another part

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.070
are setting up um and uh another part this is a storefront actually this is a

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080

storefront.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.150
storefront. Uh there is a configuration how to uh

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160
Uh there is a configuration how to uh

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.070
Uh there is a configuration how to uh set up uh and define whether storefront

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080
set up uh and define whether storefront

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.389
set up uh and define whether storefront is available for everyone or it is

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399
is available for everyone or it is

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:12.070
is available for everyone or it is available only for registered users. And

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080
available only for registered users. And

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.350
available only for registered users. And uh the the second thing is uh the next

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360
uh the the second thing is uh the next

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.590
uh the the second thing is uh the next thing is that uh it is partially

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600
thing is that uh it is partially

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.910
thing is that uh it is partially protected. And the partially uh I mean

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920
protected. And the partially uh I mean

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.269
protected. And the partially uh I mean that um uh we do have u uh an ability to

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279
that um uh we do have u uh an ability to

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.910
that um uh we do have u uh an ability to uh specify different provisions for for

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920
uh specify different provisions for for

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.470
uh specify different provisions for for different types of users. But on the

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480
different types of users. But on the

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.430
different types of users. But on the other hand u guest users uh are also um

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440
other hand u guest users uh are also um

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.670
other hand u guest users uh are also um available to access storefront. That's

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680
available to access storefront. That's

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.590
available to access storefront. That's why um we call it partially protected uh

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600
why um we call it partially protected uh

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.910
why um we call it partially protected uh part of the application and uh in

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920
part of the application and uh in

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.949
part of the application and uh in storefront performance uh matters more

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959
storefront performance uh matters more

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.949
storefront performance uh matters more than uh functionality. So the

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959
than uh functionality. So the

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.630
than uh functionality. So the interaction uh should be uh fast for

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640
interaction uh should be uh fast for

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.269
interaction uh should be uh fast for better user experience. Uh yeah and

00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279
better user experience. Uh yeah and

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:02.949
better user experience. Uh yeah and that's the person uh that's the uh the

00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959
that's the person uh that's the uh the

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:05.350
that's the person uh that's the uh the idea why performance uh is more

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360
idea why performance uh is more

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.829
idea why performance uh is more important than uh functionality. And

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839
important than uh functionality. And

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:10.949
important than uh functionality. And sometimes in documentation uh storefront

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959
sometimes in documentation uh storefront

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:14.069
sometimes in documentation uh storefront is named as a front end uh part of

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079
is named as a front end uh part of

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.870
is named as a front end uh part of application. Actually let me demonstrate

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880
application. Actually let me demonstrate

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.550
application. Actually let me demonstrate u the difference and how it looks. Uh so

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560
u the difference and how it looks. Uh so

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.310
u the difference and how it looks. Uh so this is uh uh Orocommerce application

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320
this is uh uh Orocommerce application

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.910
this is uh uh Orocommerce application and uh with that uh uh so without any

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920
and uh with that uh uh so without any

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.870
and uh with that uh uh so without any URL uh prefix uh right now

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880
URL uh prefix uh right now

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.030
URL uh prefix uh right now I am navigating a website and uh this is

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040
I am navigating a website and uh this is

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.550
I am navigating a website and uh this is uh uh a storefront

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
uh uh a storefront

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.710
uh uh a storefront uh as I mentioned storefront uh

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720
uh as I mentioned storefront uh

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.790
uh as I mentioned storefront uh could be

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800
could be

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.710
could be accessed by um guest users or registered

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720
accessed by um guest users or registered

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.990
accessed by um guest users or registered users. Uh yeah, that's the entry point

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000
users. Uh yeah, that's the entry point

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.069
users. Uh yeah, that's the entry point which uh then identifies uh uh or logs

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079
which uh then identifies uh uh or logs

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:02.230
which uh then identifies uh uh or logs in users to the storefront. And on the

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240
in users to the storefront. And on the

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.230
in users to the storefront. And on the other hand side uh if I uh open the same

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240
other hand side uh if I uh open the same

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.910
other hand side uh if I uh open the same URL the same uh URL but at admin

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920
URL the same uh URL but at admin

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.949
URL the same uh URL but at admin uh prefix um

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.910
um right now I have um I was already

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920
um right now I have um I was already

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.870
um right now I have um I was already logged in but let me log out just to you

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880
logged in but let me log out just to you

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.670
logged in but let me log out just to you to demonstrate. So uh so while

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680
to demonstrate. So uh so while

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.389
to demonstrate. So uh so while navigating to admin

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399
navigating to admin

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.389
navigating to admin a user is landed to u to the login page

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399
a user is landed to u to the login page

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.670
a user is landed to u to the login page for the back office and uh logging into

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680
for the back office and uh logging into

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.310
for the back office and uh logging into the back office

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320
the back office

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.790
the back office I'm actually landed to it and you may uh

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800
I'm actually landed to it and you may uh

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.110
I'm actually landed to it and you may uh see that I will start a consumers

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120
see that I will start a consumers

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.269
see that I will start a consumers second

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279
second

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.949
second uh for the application. So uh with that

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959
uh for the application. So uh with that

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:56.150
uh for the application. So uh with that I have logged into the back office

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160
I have logged into the back office

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.030
I have logged into the back office and you may uh see the difference uh

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040
and you may uh see the difference uh

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.350
and you may uh see the difference uh first of all in theme uh so it

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360
first of all in theme uh so it

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.590
first of all in theme uh so it difference u while uh storefront has

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600
difference u while uh storefront has

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.430
difference u while uh storefront has different colors right and uh uh back

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440
different colors right and uh uh back

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.870
different colors right and uh uh back office is this white and gray uh colors

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880
office is this white and gray uh colors

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.710
office is this white and gray uh colors uh uh no special styles and different uh

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720
uh uh no special styles and different uh

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.509
uh uh no special styles and different uh sections

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519
sections

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.910
sections which gives an ability to configure uh

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920
which gives an ability to configure uh

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.629
which gives an ability to configure uh the application. We will go over them uh

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639
the application. We will go over them uh

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:30.310
the application. We will go over them uh during uh our training.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.790
Okay, let's continue. So this is the

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800
Okay, let's continue. So this is the

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.949
Okay, let's continue. So this is the difference and how they looks like

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959
difference and how they looks like

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:41.990
difference and how they looks like uh on this uh uh picture.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000
uh on this uh uh picture.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.829
uh on this uh uh picture. It demonstrates actually the difference

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839
It demonstrates actually the difference

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:46.310
It demonstrates actually the difference between back office and storefront and

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320
between back office and storefront and

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.550
between back office and storefront and mostly uh how the data flows uh between

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560
mostly uh how the data flows uh between

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.670
mostly uh how the data flows uh between both uh parts. So uh back office this is

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680
both uh parts. So uh back office this is

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.150
both uh parts. So uh back office this is the place where we configure application

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
the place where we configure application

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.190
the place where we configure application and it has full control over those parts

00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200
and it has full control over those parts

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.030
and it has full control over those parts which are uh in their behavior on the

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040
which are uh in their behavior on the

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.590
which are uh in their behavior on the storefront. Uh and uh while we have some

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600
storefront. Uh and uh while we have some

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.910
storefront. Uh and uh while we have some interaction with the

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920
interaction with the

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.990
interaction with the with the storefront, user goes to the uh

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000
with the storefront, user goes to the uh

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.389
with the storefront, user goes to the uh to the listing page, add some products

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399
to the listing page, add some products

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:19.190
to the listing page, add some products to the shopping list, uh goes and

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200
to the shopping list, uh goes and

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.030
to the shopping list, uh goes and purchases them. Uh we have like u this

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040
purchases them. Uh we have like u this

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.710
purchases them. Uh we have like u this interaction. Then the data flows uh from

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720
interaction. Then the data flows uh from

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.509
interaction. Then the data flows uh from storefront uh to the back office and uh

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519
storefront uh to the back office and uh

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:33.590
storefront uh to the back office and uh reflected there for uh

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600
reflected there for uh

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.829
reflected there for uh further processing by the sales

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839
further processing by the sales

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.550
further processing by the sales representative and we have this uh kind

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560
representative and we have this uh kind

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.069
representative and we have this uh kind of separation between uh the roles uh

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079
of separation between uh the roles uh

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:45.829
of separation between uh the roles uh who are acting on both uh ends of

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839
who are acting on both uh ends of

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.670
who are acting on both uh ends of application.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680
application.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.430
application. So in the back office we have like

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440
So in the back office we have like

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.710
So in the back office we have like administrators who administrates. Uh we

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720
administrators who administrates. Uh we

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.509
administrators who administrates. Uh we have uh different uh the ability to set

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519
have uh different uh the ability to set

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:59.910
have uh different uh the ability to set up roles uh for those users uh uh for

00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920
up roles uh for those users uh uh for

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.670
up roles uh for those users uh uh for the both uh back office users and uh uh

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680
the both uh back office users and uh uh

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.710
the both uh back office users and uh uh storefront users. have the place for

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720
storefront users. have the place for

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.230
storefront users. have the place for configuring um different u application

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240
configuring um different u application

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.750
configuring um different u application on different levels and manage those

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760
on different levels and manage those

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.870
on different levels and manage those entities which are created by the uh

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880
entities which are created by the uh

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.310
entities which are created by the uh front users. Uh so whenever order is

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320
front users. Uh so whenever order is

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.310
front users. Uh so whenever order is created then it is reflected in a in a

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320
created then it is reflected in a in a

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.509
created then it is reflected in a in a back office office for for next uh

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519
back office office for for next uh

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:30.389
back office office for for next uh operations with it and of course yeah

it was um uh de developed um using uh following packages uh which are

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040
following packages uh which are

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.750
following packages uh which are each of them were built on top of

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760
each of them were built on top of

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.110
each of them were built on top of another one and it extends

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120
another one and it extends

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.829
another one and it extends with additional functionality. Okay. So

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839
with additional functionality. Okay. So

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.310
with additional functionality. Okay. So the first package which is um uh

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320

space uh so customer portal this is

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.629
space uh so customer portal this is actually let's u let me

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639
actually let's u let me

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:42.150
actually let's u let me pick up uh

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160
pick up uh

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.990
pick up uh and let's open so this part is uh so

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000
and let's open so this part is uh so

Okay. Now let's continue and uh return back to the storefront.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.310
uh while I was demonstrating uh

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320

storefront uh and back office u I've uh

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.990
storefront uh and back office u I've uh uh I was navigated to the back office uh

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000
uh I was navigated to the back office uh

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.270
uh I was navigated to the back office uh through this admin prefix uh so this is

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280
through this admin prefix uh so this is

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.070
through this admin prefix uh so this is the thing that could be uh configured

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080
the thing that could be uh configured

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.950
the thing that could be uh configured and u so instead of using admin you

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960
and u so instead of using admin you

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.710
and u so instead of using admin you might use some um hash for instance uh

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720
might use some um hash for instance uh

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.870
might use some um hash for instance uh or some some other naming you would like

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880
or some some other naming you would like

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.110
or some some other naming you would like for your for instance back office just

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120
for your for instance back office just

for your for instance back office just as an example and for that you how it

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640
as an example and for that you how it

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.990
as an example and for that you how it could be configured. It could be

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000
could be configured. It could be

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.830
could be configured. It could be configured via this uh

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840
configured via this uh

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.549
configured via this uh application uh parameters. Here we have

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559
application uh parameters. Here we have

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:43.029
application uh parameters. Here we have a so in under configuration uh config

a so in under configuration uh config

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.270
a so in under configuration uh config file we have a list of parameters all

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280

available here. So and uh one of that actually web

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080
here. So and uh one of that actually web

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.430
here. So and uh one of that actually web back end prefix it is responsible for

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440
back end prefix it is responsible for

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.150
back end prefix it is responsible for managing the the prefix for the back

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160

office. uh while uh so whenever you will be

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120
uh while uh so whenever you will be

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.350
uh while uh so whenever you will be introducing um additional uh roots for

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360
introducing um additional uh roots for

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.230
introducing um additional uh roots for additional uh functionality for the uh

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240
additional uh functionality for the uh

additional uh functionality for the uh storefront

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840
storefront

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.950
storefront uh the um

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960
uh the um

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.029
uh the um using croin and symfony roin and

00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039
using croin and symfony roin and

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:21.990
using croin and symfony roin and controllers controller actions those

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000
controllers controller actions those

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.750
controllers controller actions those roots which are available which should

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760
roots which are available which should

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.909
roots which are available which should be available for the storefront they

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919
be available for the storefront they

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:30.870
be available for the storefront they should be um configured or defined

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880
should be um configured or defined

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.310
should be um configured or defined with a additional u option uh called uh

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320
with a additional u option uh called uh

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.990
with a additional u option uh called uh front end and pass it to true. So it

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000
front end and pass it to true. So it

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.470
front end and pass it to true. So it will mean that um these uh root and

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480
will mean that um these uh root and

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.510
will mean that um these uh root and controllers they will be available uh

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520
controllers they will be available uh

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.310
controllers they will be available uh only for the storefront. If you do not

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320
only for the storefront. If you do not

only for the storefront. If you do not define this part uh then uh the put in

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039
define this part uh then uh the put in

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:58.470
define this part uh then uh the put in the controller will be uh acting only

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480
the controller will be uh acting only

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.789
the controller will be uh acting only for the back office. So that's that's

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799
for the back office. So that's that's

front end exposed roots extractor and uh

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.950
front end exposed roots extractor and uh actually if you find something is not

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960
actually if you find something is not

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.230
actually if you find something is not working so you have defined you

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240
working so you have defined you

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.110
working so you have defined you put a break point here to check why the

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120
put a break point here to check why the

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.830
put a break point here to check why the root is not exposed just uh as a

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840
root is not exposed just uh as a

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.870
root is not exposed just uh as a reference for

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880
reference for

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.190
reference for yeah and how how it works. Uh you may

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200
yeah and how how it works. Uh you may

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.590
yeah and how how it works. Uh you may check it here.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600
check it here.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.750
check it here. Uh yeah actually the responsibility is

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760
Uh yeah actually the responsibility is

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.590
Uh yeah actually the responsibility is mentioned in

mentioned in

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.590
mentioned in this doc block. Okay. So and uh another

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600
this doc block. Okay. So and uh another

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.310
this doc block. Okay. So and uh another thing so whenever you have a storefront

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320
thing so whenever you have a storefront

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.909
thing so whenever you have a storefront u root uh for your functionality uh you

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919
u root uh for your functionality uh you

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:18.070
u root uh for your functionality uh you would need uh sometimes you would need

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080
would need uh sometimes you would need

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.549
would need uh sometimes you would need to have this route uh

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559
to have this route uh

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.870
to have this route uh to be

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880
to be

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.590
to be act or

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:37.110
JavaScript and uh from JavaScript components. Um in this case uh those

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120
components. Um in this case uh those

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.630
components. Um in this case uh those roots u storefront roots they should be

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640
roots u storefront roots they should be

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.990
roots u storefront roots they should be uh defined uh using u

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000
uh defined uh using u

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.510

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:35.510
bundle comment uh listed here. Uh okay let's continue.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.430
So we have um a route um under which you

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440
So we have um a route um under which you

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.310
So we have um a route um under which you can u u land on which you can land and

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320
can u u land on which you can land and

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.909
can u u land on which you can land and navigate uh in a storefront. Uh but as I

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919
navigate uh in a storefront. Uh but as I

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:50.149
navigate uh in a storefront. Uh but as I uh mentioned uh as I mentioned before

00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159
uh mentioned uh as I mentioned before

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:55.029
uh mentioned uh as I mentioned before those routes could be uh available for

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039
those routes could be uh available for

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.230
those routes could be uh available for uh guest users right uh in a storefront

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240
uh guest users right uh in a storefront

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.669
uh guest users right uh in a storefront like here I am navigating the storefront

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679
like here I am navigating the storefront

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:05.270
like here I am navigating the storefront uh checking the website uh viewing

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280
uh checking the website uh viewing

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.830
uh checking the website uh viewing details of the of the of the products

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840
details of the of the of the products

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.110
details of the of the of the products and so on. uh on the other hand side I

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120
and so on. uh on the other hand side I

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.750
and so on. uh on the other hand side I may act as a registered user and for

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760
may act as a registered user and for

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.870
may act as a registered user and for that I would need to sign in

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880
that I would need to sign in

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.510
that I would need to sign in uh the part that is uh related to uh or

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520
uh the part that is uh related to uh or

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.549
uh the part that is uh related to uh or responsible for uh

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559
responsible for uh

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:28.789
responsible for uh registered users uh and especially the

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799
registered users uh and especially the

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:32.710
registered users uh and especially the so we we will actually cover how those

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720
so we we will actually cover how those

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.870
so we we will actually cover how those entities a bit before those customer

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880
entities a bit before those customer

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.549
entities a bit before those customer users but the main idea is that all of

00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559
users but the main idea is that all of

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:41.750
users but the main idea is that all of Um um so not all of them but customer

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760
Um um so not all of them but customer

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.830
Um um so not all of them but customer users uh they are

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840
users uh they are

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.149
users uh they are implementing uh user interface uh and

00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159
implementing uh user interface uh and

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:53.669
implementing uh user interface uh and you may check what kind of uh

00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679
you may check what kind of uh

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.870
you may check what kind of uh uh methods uh available uh for for the

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880
uh methods uh available uh for for the

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.789
uh methods uh available uh for for the user u for the user entity.

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799
user u for the user entity.

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.350
user u for the user entity. Yeah. And if you go to the actually let

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
Yeah. And if you go to the actually let

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.669
Yeah. And if you go to the actually let me open in the

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679
me open in the

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:15.830
me open in the it here.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.390
Okay. And here we may check uh what kind

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400
Okay. And here we may check uh what kind

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.630
Okay. And here we may check uh what kind of entities are implementing this user

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640
of entities are implementing this user

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.269
of entities are implementing this user interface. And one of them this is uh

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279
interface. And one of them this is uh

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:28.310
interface. And one of them this is uh customer user entity which is uh u the

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320
customer user entity which is uh u the

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.190
customer user entity which is uh u the entity for the registered uh for the

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200
entity for the registered uh for the

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.470
entity for the registered uh for the registered users. Okay. We have a user

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480
registered users. Okay. We have a user

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.070
registered users. Okay. We have a user interface. On the other hand side we for

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080
interface. On the other hand side we for

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.110
interface. On the other hand side we for configuring uh whom we are allowing to

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120
configuring uh whom we are allowing to

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.990
configuring uh whom we are allowing to access a website. We have

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000
access a website. We have

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.230
access a website. We have an entity which implements user

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240
an entity which implements user

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.070
an entity which implements user interface. On the other hand side, we

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080
interface. On the other hand side, we

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.070
interface. On the other hand side, we should have a custom u user provider uh

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080
should have a custom u user provider uh

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.269
should have a custom u user provider uh which is u built on top of u symfony

00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279
which is u built on top of u symfony

00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:04.630
which is u built on top of u symfony uh oh like uh symfony user providers

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.390
and we have a definition of the firewall

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400
and we have a definition of the firewall

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.070
and we have a definition of the firewall whom we are allowing under which roots

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080
whom we are allowing under which roots

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.750
whom we are allowing under which roots what kind of user provider we are using

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760
what kind of user provider we are using

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.870
what kind of user provider we are using uh for

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880
uh for

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.990
uh for authentificating uh users. And actually

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000
authentificating uh users. And actually

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.190
authentificating uh users. And actually this is the uh the definition of the

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200
this is the uh the definition of the

firewall. uh and you may see that uh

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.870
firewall. uh and you may see that uh front end part it uh relies uh uh on the

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.789
and failure handlers uh for this uh uh for this uh for this firewall for the

00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799
uh for this uh for this firewall for the

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:33.510
uh for this uh for this firewall for the front end firewall.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520
front end firewall.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.590
front end firewall. Um so yeah by this uh this is actually

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600
Um so yeah by this uh this is actually

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.870
Um so yeah by this uh this is actually the service uh uh

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.950
the names of the services by which you

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960
the names of the services by which you

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.430
the names of the services by which you can uh check uh how they are working uh

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440
can uh check uh how they are working uh

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.630
can uh check uh how they are working uh under the hood

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640
under the hood

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.430
under the hood and that's how uh storefront uh security

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440
and that's how uh storefront uh security

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.710
and that's how uh storefront uh security is configured. First of all uh need to

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720
is configured. First of all uh need to

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.870
is configured. First of all uh need to remember about this uh firewall

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880
remember about this uh firewall

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.269
remember about this uh firewall definition. What kind of providers

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279
definition. What kind of providers

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.230
definition. What kind of providers handlers are defined there? And whenever

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240
handlers are defined there? And whenever

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.350
handlers are defined there? And whenever you would like to extend to to change

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360
you would like to extend to to change

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.630
you would like to extend to to change the behavior uh provide for instance

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640
the behavior uh provide for instance

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.669
the behavior uh provide for instance customer uh users or registered users

00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679
customer uh users or registered users

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:21.909
customer uh users or registered users while logging in uh by u some another um

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919
while logging in uh by u some another um

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:24.950
while logging in uh by u some another um logic by some another criterias. Uh you

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960
logic by some another criterias. Uh you

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.389
logic by some another criterias. Uh you may refer to that um firewall

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399
may refer to that um firewall

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:32.310
may refer to that um firewall u definition uh find responsible u

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320
u definition uh find responsible u

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.510
u definition uh find responsible u service which is uh uh you would like to

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520
service which is uh uh you would like to

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.070
service which is uh uh you would like to customize and

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080
customize and

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.630
customize and yeah and that uh customization in that

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640

in the terms you would like

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:49.430
in the terms you would like uh I guess that's it about uh storefront

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440
uh I guess that's it about uh storefront

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.750
uh I guess that's it about uh storefront um uh and now let's uh talk a bit uh not

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760
um uh and now let's uh talk a bit uh not

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.789
um uh and now let's uh talk a bit uh not talk a bit but continue with the uh with

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799
talk a bit but continue with the uh with

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.950
talk a bit but continue with the uh with the

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960
the

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.710
the websites. So we have a storefront and uh

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720
websites. So we have a storefront and uh

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:14.070
websites. So we have a storefront and uh actually it is operated uh storefront.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.110
Let me close as a website and you may

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120
Let me close as a website and you may

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.710
Let me close as a website and you may have uh different websites in your

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720
have uh different websites in your

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.470
have uh different websites in your Orocommerce application. So you have

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480
Orocommerce application. So you have

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.029
Orocommerce application. So you have like one environment but uh you may have

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039
like one environment but uh you may have

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:31.269
like one environment but uh you may have uh on the same environment um different

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279
uh on the same environment um different

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:34.070
uh on the same environment um different uh websites serving uh different

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080
uh websites serving uh different

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.830
uh websites serving uh different websites.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840
websites.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.630
websites. Uh right now I am like navigating over

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640
Uh right now I am like navigating over

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.950
Uh right now I am like navigating over single website but I will demonstrate

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960
single website but I will demonstrate

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.870
single website but I will demonstrate you how website could be configured. And

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880
you how website could be configured. And

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.510
you how website could be configured. And uh the purpose of the website is to

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520
uh the purpose of the website is to

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.630
uh the purpose of the website is to introduce uh like different uh content

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640
introduce uh like different uh content

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.269
introduce uh like different uh content uh uh

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279
uh uh

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.830
uh uh for different types of users. Uh you may

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840
for different types of users. Uh you may

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.149
for different types of users. Uh you may have uh different products you would

00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159
have uh different products you would

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:02.310
have uh different products you would like to present for uh for different

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320
like to present for uh for different

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.630
like to present for uh for different websites. So for instance, one website

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640
websites. So for instance, one website

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.269
websites. So for instance, one website would be uh presenting for one types of

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279
would be uh presenting for one types of

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.070
would be uh presenting for one types of users uh one list of products while

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080
users uh one list of products while

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.029
users uh one list of products while another will have another catalog of

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039
another will have another catalog of

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:18.549
another will have another catalog of products. Uh and per this let's say

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559
products. Uh and per this let's say

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.789
products. Uh and per this let's say website B you will specify the

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799
website B you will specify the

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:23.029
website B you will specify the visibility of the products you would

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039
visibility of the products you would

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:25.510
visibility of the products you would like to uh to be presented for the end

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520
like to uh to be presented for the end

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.310
like to uh to be presented for the end users. Uh

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320
users. Uh

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.149
users. Uh in some cases um CL we have client we

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159
in some cases um CL we have client we

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.909
in some cases um CL we have client we are working with clients we are working

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919
are working with clients we are working

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:38.389
are working with clients we are working with uh usually um cases is that one

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399
with uh usually um cases is that one

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:42.470
with uh usually um cases is that one website they are is configured for the

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480
website they are is configured for the

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.669
website they are is configured for the uh B2B clients while another one is to

00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679
uh B2B clients while another one is to

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:50.070
uh B2B clients while another one is to B2C and so um that's pretty obvious that

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080
B2C and so um that's pretty obvious that

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.750
B2C and so um that's pretty obvious that for B2B we have like one uh purchase uh

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760
for B2B we have like one uh purchase uh

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.789
for B2B we have like one uh purchase uh process to be set up while for B2C

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799
process to be set up while for B2C

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:59.669
process to be set up while for B2C This is right another experience and

00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679
This is right another experience and

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:02.789
This is right another experience and yeah in this case uh websites uh might

00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799
yeah in this case uh websites uh might

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:07.350
yeah in this case uh websites uh might be useful for uh for setting up

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360
be useful for uh for setting up

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.149
be useful for uh for setting up and um so websites might have different

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159
and um so websites might have different

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.389
and um so websites might have different localization set up. For instance, one

00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399
localization set up. For instance, one

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:17.029
localization set up. For instance, one website is set up for uh for one

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039
website is set up for uh for one

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:19.110
website is set up for uh for one localization, French for instance, while

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120
localization, French for instance, while

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.669
localization, French for instance, while another one is for u Japanese or another

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679
another one is for u Japanese or another

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:26.950
another one is for u Japanese or another uh localization. And while navigating

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960
uh localization. And while navigating

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.269
uh localization. And while navigating the website, uh there is an ability to

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279
the website, uh there is an ability to

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:32.870
the website, uh there is an ability to configure different uh uh

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880
configure different uh uh

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.269
configure different uh uh menus uh which will be available for

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279
menus uh which will be available for

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.990
menus uh which will be available for those uh for those websites.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000
those uh for those websites.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.350
those uh for those websites. Uh let me demonstrate uh how it looks

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360
Uh let me demonstrate uh how it looks

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.950
Uh let me demonstrate uh how it looks like uh using our commerce application.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960
like uh using our commerce application.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.590
like uh using our commerce application. Um so the configuration for the websites

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600
Um so the configuration for the websites

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.830
Um so the configuration for the websites it starts actually from the back office.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840
it starts actually from the back office.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.389
it starts actually from the back office. Uh as I mentioned before back office is

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399
Uh as I mentioned before back office is

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:55.669
Uh as I mentioned before back office is something uh we start configuring our

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679
something uh we start configuring our

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:59.750
something uh we start configuring our application. So if you go to system um

00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760
application. So if you go to system um

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.630
application. So if you go to system um websites

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640
websites

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.830
websites we have uh here a list of actually um

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840
we have uh here a list of actually um

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.710
we have uh here a list of actually um this is the uh autocommerce application

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720
this is the uh autocommerce application

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.389
this is the uh autocommerce application I have installed with the uh demoator

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399
I have installed with the uh demoator

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:15.669
I have installed with the uh demoator uh and yeah that's why um all those

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679
uh and yeah that's why um all those

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.230
uh and yeah that's why um all those websites are listed here this is a demo

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240
websites are listed here this is a demo

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.990
websites are listed here this is a demo data and now we have uh we do see a list

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000
data and now we have uh we do see a list

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.630
data and now we have uh we do see a list of websites we have

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640
of websites we have

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.630
of websites we have uh already uh created and configured and

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640
uh already uh created and configured and

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.509
uh already uh created and configured and one of them uh is uh the default one uh

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519
one of them uh is uh the default one uh

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:37.669
one of them uh is uh the default one uh this one uh default with the flag yes

00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679
this one uh default with the flag yes

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:41.509
this one uh default with the flag yes all others are uh not non-default

00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519
all others are uh not non-default

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:44.950
all others are uh not non-default websites uh so if you go to the default

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960
websites uh so if you go to the default

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.149
websites uh so if you go to the default u so okay while creating a website

00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159
u so okay while creating a website

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:52.310
u so okay while creating a website the main idea is to specify the owner of

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320
the main idea is to specify the owner of

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.710
the main idea is to specify the owner of the website uh the name of the website

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720
the website uh the name of the website

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.909
the website uh the name of the website uh configure um

00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919
uh configure um

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:06.070
uh configure um uh should it be used for B2B or B2C? Um

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080
uh should it be used for B2B or B2C? Um

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.029
uh should it be used for B2B or B2C? Um actually this options uh while enabling

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039
actually this options uh while enabling

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:15.430
actually this options uh while enabling this option it will help us uh to set up

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440
this option it will help us uh to set up

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.830
this option it will help us uh to set up website properly and do um and perform

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840
website properly and do um and perform

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.990
website properly and do um and perform some uh configuration changes uh for us

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000
some uh configuration changes uh for us

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.870
some uh configuration changes uh for us under the hood. Uh we will check what

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880
under the hood. Uh we will check what

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.070
under the hood. Uh we will check what kind of u settings are meant uh when we

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080
kind of u settings are meant uh when we

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.669
kind of u settings are meant uh when we are configuring a website for the B2C.

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679
are configuring a website for the B2C.

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:36.630
are configuring a website for the B2C. Uh so we have the ability to specify uh

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640
Uh so we have the ability to specify uh

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.870
Uh so we have the ability to specify uh what price lists should be used for the

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880
what price lists should be used for the

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.430
what price lists should be used for the website. We will check it during price

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440
website. We will check it during price

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.389
website. We will check it during price list uh uh price topic on day I guess

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399
list uh uh price topic on day I guess

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.590
list uh uh price topic on day I guess two and some additional uh section

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600
two and some additional uh section

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.549
two and some additional uh section responsible for assigning what kind of

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559
responsible for assigning what kind of

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:56.070
responsible for assigning what kind of uh roles should be uh assigned for the

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080
uh roles should be uh assigned for the

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.870
uh roles should be uh assigned for the users for the guest users when they will

00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880
users for the guest users when they will

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.070
users for the guest users when they will be navigating the website and whenever

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080
be navigating the website and whenever

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.190
be navigating the website and whenever user registered on a website what is the

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200
user registered on a website what is the

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.270
user registered on a website what is the default uh role uh uh will be assigned

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280
default uh role uh uh will be assigned

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.589
default uh role uh uh will be assigned to this uh user.

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599
to this uh user.

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:16.869
to this uh user. Uh let me switch back.

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:20.470
Um so this is uh the form for creating

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480
Um so this is uh the form for creating

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.589
Um so this is uh the form for creating pro for creating a website. Uh another

00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599
pro for creating a website. Uh another

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:26.869
pro for creating a website. Uh another thing is uh that we can uh go to the

00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879
thing is uh that we can uh go to the

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.669
thing is uh that we can uh go to the configuration of the website. So um

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679
configuration of the website. So um

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.669
configuration of the website. So um while creating a website we will have

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679
while creating a website we will have

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.510
while creating a website we will have kind of an entity a website entity uh

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520
kind of an entity a website entity uh

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.950
kind of an entity a website entity uh with it its property name u and some

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960
with it its property name u and some

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.230
with it its property name u and some relations to the uh rows like I

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240
relations to the uh rows like I

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.950
relations to the uh rows like I demonstrated. On the other hand side we

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960
demonstrated. On the other hand side we

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.430
demonstrated. On the other hand side we are able to

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440
are able to

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.750
are able to set up uh on configuration uh uh on

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760
set up uh on configuration uh uh on

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.190
set up uh on configuration uh uh on config configuration level what kind of

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200
config configuration level what kind of

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.230
config configuration level what kind of settings the website could be. Uh so we

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240
settings the website could be. Uh so we

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.670
settings the website could be. Uh so we have uh if we go to system configuration

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680
have uh if we go to system configuration

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.270
have uh if we go to system configuration back office has uh

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280
back office has uh

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.829
back office has uh its own like global uh global

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839
its own like global uh global

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.910
its own like global uh global configuration

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920
configuration

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.310
configuration and here you may see different uh

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320
and here you may see different uh

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.270
and here you may see different uh sections of uh configuration related to

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280
sections of uh configuration related to

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.910
sections of uh configuration related to diff to different parts of application.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920
diff to different parts of application.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.829
diff to different parts of application. Okay. So this is a global configuration

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839
Okay. So this is a global configuration

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:23.750
Okay. So this is a global configuration of the uh the application. Now if I go

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760
of the uh the application. Now if I go

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.829
of the uh the application. Now if I go to uh system websites, let me open in a

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839
to uh system websites, let me open in a

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:30.950
to uh system websites, let me open in a in a separate window.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960
in a separate window.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.990
in a separate window. Each individual website can have its own

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000
Each individual website can have its own

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.950
Each individual website can have its own configuration which will override global

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960
configuration which will override global

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.910
configuration which will override global configuration. Let me go to uh for

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920
configuration. Let me go to uh for

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.630
configuration. Let me go to uh for instance this one Europe website and

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640
instance this one Europe website and

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.870
instance this one Europe website and open

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880
open

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.150
open uh so this is a conf it also opens a a

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160
uh so this is a conf it also opens a a

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.030
uh so this is a conf it also opens a a page uh for configuring but this is

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040
page uh for configuring but this is

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.510
page uh for configuring but this is specifically for configuring uh the

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520
specifically for configuring uh the

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.790
specifically for configuring uh the settings uh for the website uh level uh

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800
settings uh for the website uh level uh

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.069
settings uh for the website uh level uh in the uh terms of Europe uh website and

00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079
in the uh terms of Europe uh website and

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:08.150
in the uh terms of Europe uh website and uh it has it will have less options

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160
uh it has it will have less options

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.790
uh it has it will have less options steps uh than global configuration uh

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800
steps uh than global configuration uh

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.310
steps uh than global configuration uh because uh some of them uh uh might not

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320
because uh some of them uh uh might not

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.790
because uh some of them uh uh might not be relevant to the website configuration

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800
be relevant to the website configuration

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.349
be relevant to the website configuration but nevertheless here we may check yeah

00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359
but nevertheless here we may check yeah

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:24.069
but nevertheless here we may check yeah it uh lists uh less products uh so I'm

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079
it uh lists uh less products uh so I'm

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:26.390
it uh lists uh less products uh so I'm sorry less settings

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400
sorry less settings

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.510
sorry less settings and actually let's uh check what how it

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520
and actually let's uh check what how it

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.670
and actually let's uh check what how it this configuration works

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.910
okay let me demonstrate u uh How?

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.270
So we have this um URL which is uh which

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280
So we have this um URL which is uh which

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.870
So we have this um URL which is uh which works for us. Um

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880
works for us. Um

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.230
works for us. Um when we are navigating to the website um

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240
when we are navigating to the website um

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.870
when we are navigating to the website um and we have the the URL for the default

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880
and we have the the URL for the default

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.910
and we have the the URL for the default website. Okay. Now I will um I will

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920
website. Okay. Now I will um I will

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.510
website. Okay. Now I will um I will configure this Europe website and uh

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520
configure this Europe website and uh

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.790
configure this Europe website and uh make it its URL

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800
make it its URL

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.750
make it its URL this one.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.589
If I'm not mistaken, it should this one.

00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599
If I'm not mistaken, it should this one.

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.109
If I'm not mistaken, it should this one. Okay.

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119
Okay.

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:16.630
Okay. So I I have changed and specified that

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640
So I I have changed and specified that

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:23.030
So I I have changed and specified that Euro website should have its own uh URL.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.230
Okay. Now I will be navigating to the

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240
Okay. Now I will be navigating to the

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.910
Okay. Now I will be navigating to the URL

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920
URL

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.829
URL and I specified

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839
and I specified

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:35.510
and I specified one second I will check what was the

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520
one second I will check what was the

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.910
one second I will check what was the uh URL that I've configured for the

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920
uh URL that I've configured for the

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.910
uh URL that I've configured for the Europe. Okay, maybe it was

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920
Europe. Okay, maybe it was

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.790
Europe. Okay, maybe it was with the dot. One second.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800
with the dot. One second.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.230
with the dot. One second. I guess with the dot

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240
I guess with the dot

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.390
I guess with the dot save settings.

Okay, I will check what was the

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.750
Okay, I will check what was the configuration for the

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.750
uh for the Europe website. They have

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760
uh for the Europe website. They have

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.069
uh for the Europe website. They have been uh

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079
been uh

00:38:32.079 --> 00:39:32.790
been uh on my environment. One second.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.750
server list.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760
server list.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.829
server list. Okay. So, I have

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:44.790
what was that? Europe. Yeah. Through the

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800
what was that? Europe. Yeah. Through the

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.030
what was that? Europe. Yeah. Through the dot.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040

Sorry for inconvenience.

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.190
[Music]

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200
[Music]

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.630
[Music] Okay, here I have a proper one. Let me

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640
Okay, here I have a proper one. Let me

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:30.390
Okay, here I have a proper one. Let me put here

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.670
something

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.109
I redirected to this one. I specify the

00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119
I redirected to this one. I specify the

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:43.109
I redirected to this one. I specify the Europe.

00:40:43.119 --> 00:41:02.630
Mhm.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.750

Yeah, I have saved. Now I go to this one.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.430
I am using dev mode. Uh right now

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440
I am using dev mode. Uh right now

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.309
I am using dev mode. Uh right now just uh for demonstrating

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319
just uh for demonstrating

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:11.109
just uh for demonstrating different uh settings we'll have here.

00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119
different uh settings we'll have here.

00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:14.069
different uh settings we'll have here. So it that's why it takes uh a bit more

00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079
So it that's why it takes uh a bit more

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:17.030
So it that's why it takes uh a bit more time for the

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040
time for the

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.670
time for the uh to

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680
uh to

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:27.430
uh to for the response.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.750
Okay, let's

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760
Okay, let's

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.589
Okay, let's um let me continue. I will check in a

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599
um let me continue. I will check in a

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:36.550
um let me continue. I will check in a moment. So I as I mentioned so we have

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560
moment. So I as I mentioned so we have

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.030
moment. So I as I mentioned so we have like a multiple websites and the key

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040
like a multiple websites and the key

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.829
like a multiple websites and the key point while it is loading I will check

00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839
point while it is loading I will check

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:44.870
point while it is loading I will check in a moment. So we have a the ability to

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880
in a moment. So we have a the ability to

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.550
in a moment. So we have a the ability to specify multiple websites. Uh but uh

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560

this uh feature is available for the uh

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.829
this uh feature is available for the uh enterprise edition only. So in a

00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839
enterprise edition only. So in a

00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:57.910
enterprise edition only. So in a community edition you will be able to um

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920
community edition you will be able to um

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.630
community edition you will be able to um configure on a one single website and

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640
configure on a one single website and

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.190
configure on a one single website and while having a list of websites so one

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200
while having a list of websites so one

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.589
while having a list of websites so one should be marked as a default the one

00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599
should be marked as a default the one

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:08.550
should be marked as a default the one that is used as a default website while

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560
that is used as a default website while

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.630
that is used as a default website while others are

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640
others are

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.870
others are uh non-default

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880
uh non-default

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.829
uh non-default uh each website has additional

uh each website has additional

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:18.150
uh each website has additional configuration level as I mentioned so we

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160
configuration level as I mentioned so we

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.870
configuration level as I mentioned so we have a global configuration and uh

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880

Okay, I will do it in a should be at

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:57.670
Okay, I will do it in a should be at least much faster.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.990
This is me who stopped. Uh,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.270
but I will use a break to

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.430
check the reason.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440
check the reason.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:20.630
check the reason. Okay. Now need

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.309
cash.

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319
cash.

00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:45.190
cash. One second.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.710
Okay.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720
Okay.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.390
Okay. Uh once I have it clearing, so I would

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400
Uh once I have it clearing, so I would

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.069
Uh once I have it clearing, so I would like to

00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079
like to

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.549
like to I would u like to demonstrate. So the

00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559
I would u like to demonstrate. So the

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.870
I would u like to demonstrate. So the plan was to demonstrate uh the ability

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880
plan was to demonstrate uh the ability

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.230
plan was to demonstrate uh the ability to configure uh different uh currencies

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240
to configure uh different uh currencies

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.150
to configure uh different uh currencies per the website and I will demonstrate

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160
per the website and I will demonstrate

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.309
per the website and I will demonstrate in a moment. So with that we are able to

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319
in a moment. So with that we are able to

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:07.190
in a moment. So with that we are able to specify uh what kind of currency are

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200
specify uh what kind of currency are

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.030
specify uh what kind of currency are available for the website for the euro

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040
available for the website for the euro

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.990
available for the website for the euro for instance euro. Uh same for the

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000
for instance euro. Uh same for the

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.470
for instance euro. Uh same for the localization one site uh might be using

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480
localization one site uh might be using

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.750
localization one site uh might be using one uh language another u

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760
one uh language another u

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.710
one uh language another u another language. Uh we can have

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720
another language. Uh we can have

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.470
another language. Uh we can have multiple uh uh localizations and

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480
multiple uh uh localizations and

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.430
multiple uh uh localizations and multiple currencies uh enabled for the

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440
multiple currencies uh enabled for the

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.270
multiple currencies uh enabled for the for the website. In this case, we will

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280
for the website. In this case, we will

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.950
for the website. In this case, we will have a currency or uh language switcher.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960
have a currency or uh language switcher.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.750
have a currency or uh language switcher. Okay. One second. I will check whether

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760
Okay. One second. I will check whether

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.990
Okay. One second. I will check whether it was

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000
it was

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:51.990
it was okay.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.109
Oh, it seems like

00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119
Oh, it seems like

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:57.510
Oh, it seems like working.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520
working.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.190
working. Uh,

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.549
okay. We have enabled uh two currencies,

00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559
okay. We have enabled uh two currencies,

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:07.829
okay. We have enabled uh two currencies, United States and Euro. Uh, this is the

00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839
United States and Euro. Uh, this is the

00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:10.790
United States and Euro. Uh, this is the Euro website and the change is that uh

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800
Euro website and the change is that uh

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.950
Euro website and the change is that uh now we have this uh currency switcher

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960
now we have this uh currency switcher

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.750
now we have this uh currency switcher which we didn't have before. And same

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760
which we didn't have before. And same

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.109
which we didn't have before. And same for the localization uh default website.

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119
for the localization uh default website.

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:26.230
for the localization uh default website. It has uh it has uh just single uh local

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240
It has uh it has uh just single uh local

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.109
It has uh it has uh just single uh local uh available uh while

00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119
uh available uh while

00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:33.990
uh available uh while uh Europe website it has three uh

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000
uh Europe website it has three uh

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.390
uh Europe website it has three uh English, French and German and let's

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400
English, French and German and let's

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:45.910
English, French and German and let's check it here localization

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.990
it has English, French and German. And

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000
it has English, French and German. And

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.630
it has English, French and German. And if I like to add Spanish for instance, I

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640
if I like to add Spanish for instance, I

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.549
if I like to add Spanish for instance, I will save the changes.

00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:58.150
I will refresh. This is not it.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160
I will refresh. This is not it.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.309
I will refresh. This is not it. Europe.

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319
Europe.

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:02.549
Europe. Yep. With the production mode, you see

00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559
Yep. With the production mode, you see

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:05.270
Yep. With the production mode, you see how it uh

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280
how it uh

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.990
how it uh responses just uh so fast. So yeah, no

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000
responses just uh so fast. So yeah, no

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.030
responses just uh so fast. So yeah, no need to So I the idea was to keep uh

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040
need to So I the idea was to keep uh

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.990
need to So I the idea was to keep uh development mode enabled uh just for

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000
development mode enabled uh just for

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.990
development mode enabled uh just for demonstrating under the hood. But I will

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000
demonstrating under the hood. But I will

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.470
demonstrating under the hood. But I will reenable it once uh I would need it.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480
reenable it once uh I would need it.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.030
reenable it once uh I would need it. Right now I do not need it uh that much.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040
Right now I do not need it uh that much.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.470
Right now I do not need it uh that much. We will use pro uh uh

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480
We will use pro uh uh

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.430
We will use pro uh uh production uh mode. So if you enabled uh

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440
production uh mode. So if you enabled uh

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.630
production uh mode. So if you enabled uh Spanish and this is uh it it became

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640
Spanish and this is uh it it became

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.589
Spanish and this is uh it it became available here in a uh localization uh

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599
available here in a uh localization uh

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:38.069
available here in a uh localization uh switcher. Okay, we have different

00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079
switcher. Okay, we have different

00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:41.190
switcher. Okay, we have different websites uh for different purposes.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200
websites uh for different purposes.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.230
websites uh for different purposes. Let's switch back.

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240
Let's switch back.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.230
Let's switch back. uh localization how localization could

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240
uh localization how localization could

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.230
uh localization how localization could be configured. It could be. So first of

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240
be configured. It could be. So first of

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.990
be configured. It could be. So first of all uh this is uh this becomes useful

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000
all uh this is uh this becomes useful

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.710
all uh this is uh this becomes useful because there is like statistics about

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720
because there is like statistics about

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.470
because there is like statistics about preferences of the customer users uh u

00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480
preferences of the customer users uh u

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.109
preferences of the customer users uh u so they would like to spend more time on

00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119
so they would like to spend more time on

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:03.829
so they would like to spend more time on the on their native language that's uh

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839
the on their native language that's uh

00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:07.670
the on their native language that's uh actually obvious and how it matters on

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680
actually obvious and how it matters on

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.390
actually obvious and how it matters on their uh

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400
their uh

uh on their uh purchase uh experience.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.349
uh on their uh purchase uh experience. uh to configure localizations for the

00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359
uh to configure localizations for the

00:53:17.359 --> 00:53:20.870
uh to configure localizations for the websites we would need to go uh I

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880
websites we would need to go uh I

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.750
websites we would need to go uh I suppose this is available in uh global

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760
suppose this is available in uh global

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.030
suppose this is available in uh global configuration uh global organization I

configuration uh global organization I

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.950
configuration uh global organization I am using uh enterprise edition and

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960
am using uh enterprise edition and

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.430
am using uh enterprise edition and within the enterprise edition we are

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440
within the enterprise edition we are

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.390
within the enterprise edition we are able to configure uh multiple

able to configure uh multiple

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.589
able to configure uh multiple organizations uh per the website to

00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599
organizations uh per the website to

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:43.270
organizations uh per the website to separate the uh the entities between

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280
separate the uh the entities between

global uh website, global organization,

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.790
global uh website, global organization, we have uh localizations

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800
we have uh localizations

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.030
we have uh localizations and you may add um uh localization you

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040
and you may add um uh localization you

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.549
and you may add um uh localization you would like you would like to have

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559
would like you would like to have

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:02.470
would like you would like to have specifying the name, the title which

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480
specifying the name, the title which

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.829
specifying the name, the title which will be exposed on the storefront uh uh

00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839
will be exposed on the storefront uh uh

00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:09.349
will be exposed on the storefront uh uh on the storefront. uh select the

00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359
on the storefront. uh select the

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:12.870
on the storefront. uh select the formatting for the localization. Uh

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880
formatting for the localization. Uh

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.630
formatting for the localization. Uh enable um if this is needed ref to light

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640
enable um if this is needed ref to light

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.190
enable um if this is needed ref to light uh right uh right to left uh mode and uh

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200
uh right uh right to left uh mode and uh

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.630
uh right uh right to left uh mode and uh define parent uh localization. So each

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640
define parent uh localization. So each

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.030
define parent uh localization. So each within a localization you can build

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040
within a localization you can build

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.710
within a localization you can build creating a localization. You might have

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720
creating a localization. You might have

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.950
creating a localization. You might have a parent child hierarchy uh for that.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960
a parent child hierarchy uh for that.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.150
a parent child hierarchy uh for that. And uh

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160
And uh

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.990
And uh let's check what documentation says. Uh

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000
let's check what documentation says. Uh

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.630
let's check what documentation says. Uh yeah, this is actually a useful thing.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640
yeah, this is actually a useful thing.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.230
yeah, this is actually a useful thing. Uh so for the localization uh settings

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240
Uh so for the localization uh settings

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.589
Uh so for the localization uh settings uh uh

00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599
uh uh

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:52.630
uh uh using this class local uh settings

website, it will uh for that we would need to apply uh

00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359
for that we would need to apply uh

00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:47.270
for that we would need to apply uh additional settings to limit uh to limit

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280
additional settings to limit uh to limit

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:51.109
additional settings to limit uh to limit u its usage for the B2C clients only. By

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119
u its usage for the B2C clients only. By

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:55.190
u its usage for the B2C clients only. By limiting I mean um as uh we have here on

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200
limiting I mean um as uh we have here on

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.470
limiting I mean um as uh we have here on the slide uh changing some options um

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480
the slide uh changing some options um

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.030
the slide uh changing some options um for instance disabling requests for

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040
for instance disabling requests for

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.549
for instance disabling requests for quotes. So if uh it is a B2C client,

00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559
quotes. So if uh it is a B2C client,

00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:07.750
quotes. So if uh it is a B2C client, there is no need to negotiate uh to

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760
there is no need to negotiate uh to

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.349
there is no need to negotiate uh to request some quotes uh and start this um

00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359
request some quotes uh and start this um

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:17.030
request some quotes uh and start this um uh initiative from the uh buyer

uh initiative from the uh buyer

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.270
uh initiative from the uh buyer perspective. So request for quotes are

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280
perspective. So request for quotes are

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.069
perspective. So request for quotes are disabled. Disable quick order form. Uh

00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079
disabled. Disable quick order form. Uh

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:28.150
disabled. Disable quick order form. Uh this is a form uh this one uh default uh

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160
this is a form uh this one uh default uh

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:33.190
this is a form uh this one uh default uh sign in. I will demonstrate

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.589
uh disabling quick order form. This one

00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599
uh disabling quick order form. This one

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:39.510
uh disabling quick order form. This one it becomes not available for the uh B2C

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520
it becomes not available for the uh B2C

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.270
it becomes not available for the uh B2C uh B2C clients uh

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.630
uh B2C clients uh because this is mostly used by uh yeah

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640
because this is mostly used by uh yeah

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.309
because this is mostly used by uh yeah by B2B

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319
by B2B

00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:52.470
by B2B uh request for codes. This is um

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480
uh request for codes. This is um

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.710
uh request for codes. This is um uh

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.630
this is this part when we would like to

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640
this is this part when we would like to

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.309
this is this part when we would like to uh to create some quote uh prepare some

00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319
uh to create some quote uh prepare some

special price for the uh for the product

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.549
special price for the uh for the product we will uh check request for quotes

00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559
we will uh check request for quotes

00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:26.470
we will uh check request for quotes functionality uh during uh this training

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480
functionality uh during uh this training

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.670
functionality uh during uh this training on some of the days. Okay. So within a

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680
on some of the days. Okay. So within a

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.710
on some of the days. Okay. So within a B2C we are disable request for quotes uh

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720
B2C we are disable request for quotes uh

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.030
B2C we are disable request for quotes uh quick order form limiting number of

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040
quick order form limiting number of

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.910
quick order form limiting number of shopping lists um uh to one. So on a B2B

new lists and having multiple of them

00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:54.470
new lists and having multiple of them but for B2C we should have like one

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480
but for B2C we should have like one

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.710
but for B2C we should have like one shopping list uh let's name it shopping

01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319
reenable some of the uh uh features or

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:30.630
reenable some of the uh uh features or capabilities which are crucial for you

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640
capabilities which are crucial for you

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.390
capabilities which are crucial for you to have on a P2C website.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400
to have on a P2C website.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.549
to have on a P2C website. Um yeah and for that you would need to

01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559
Um yeah and for that you would need to

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:42.630
Um yeah and for that you would need to go manually to configuration or apply uh

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640
go manually to configuration or apply uh

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.069
go manually to configuration or apply uh changes via migration.

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079
changes via migration.

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:50.630
changes via migration. Okay, let's switch back.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.710
uh the ways how uh so remember we have a

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720
uh the ways how uh so remember we have a

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.829
uh the ways how uh so remember we have a one instance running like here I have

01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839
one instance running like here I have

01:00:57.839 --> 01:01:01.270
one instance running like here I have locally one instance running uh while we

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280
locally one instance running uh while we

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.150
locally one instance running uh while we have the ability one application running

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160
have the ability one application running

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.430
have the ability one application running while we have the ability to uh operate

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440
while we have the ability to uh operate

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.630
while we have the ability to uh operate or to u present to the end user

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640
or to u present to the end user

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.670
or to u present to the end user different websites and to the way how uh

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680
different websites and to the way how uh

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.150
different websites and to the way how uh websites uh application logic matches

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160
websites uh application logic matches

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.990
websites uh application logic matches and defines what website uh user to land

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000
and defines what website uh user to land

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.069
and defines what website uh user to land on uh to redirect to. Uh this is uh

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079
on uh to redirect to. Uh this is uh

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:31.430
on uh to redirect to. Uh this is uh performed via this website matchers and

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440
performed via this website matchers and

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.910
performed via this website matchers and we have like three uh different out of

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920
we have like three uh different out of

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.470
we have like three uh different out of the box I would say three different uh

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480
the box I would say three different uh

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.789
the box I would say three different uh options how this matching works. Uh it

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799
options how this matching works. Uh it

01:01:40.799 --> 01:01:44.549
options how this matching works. Uh it could work uh based on uh URL. So

01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559
could work uh based on uh URL. So

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:47.510
could work uh based on uh URL. So whenever I was uh

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520
whenever I was uh

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.789
whenever I was uh navigating to Europe uh okom and so on

01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799
navigating to Europe uh okom and so on

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:55.829
navigating to Europe uh okom and so on uh the website was matched by URL

01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839
uh the website was matched by URL

01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:59.430
uh the website was matched by URL because uh Europe website has this uh

01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440
because uh Europe website has this uh

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.950
because uh Europe website has this uh URL. Uh on the other hand side it could

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960
URL. Uh on the other hand side it could

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:09.190
URL. Uh on the other hand side it could be let me close it could be uh

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200
be let me close it could be uh

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.309
be let me close it could be uh uh matched by the cookie which is uh

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319
uh matched by the cookie which is uh

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:17.510
uh matched by the cookie which is uh which is available in a uh in a request

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520
which is available in a uh in a request

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.109
which is available in a uh in a request and depending on a cookie uh

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119
and depending on a cookie uh

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:25.190
and depending on a cookie uh the match uh is triggered and user is uh

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200
the match uh is triggered and user is uh

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.670
the match uh is triggered and user is uh landed to the proper website or another

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680
landed to the proper website or another

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.470
landed to the proper website or another thing is to uh based uh cookie and

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480
thing is to uh based uh cookie and

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.789
thing is to uh based uh cookie and another thing is whenever we have some

01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799
another thing is whenever we have some

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:37.510
another thing is whenever we have some specific environment variable

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520
specific environment variable

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.630
specific environment variable uh and um so we have a value for the

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640
uh and um so we have a value for the

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.430
uh and um so we have a value for the environment variable and we have a value

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440
environment variable and we have a value

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.829
environment variable and we have a value for this variable and providing this

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839
for this variable and providing this

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:50.710
for this variable and providing this variable uh we can also uh match the

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720
variable uh we can also uh match the

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.990
variable uh we can also uh match the website and u land user to it. Let's

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000
website and u land user to it. Let's

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.910
website and u land user to it. Let's check in the configuration how it looks

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920
check in the configuration how it looks

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.589
check in the configuration how it looks like.

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599
like.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:00.789
like. Uh okay we go to the back office system

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799
Uh okay we go to the back office system

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:03.430
Uh okay we go to the back office system configuration

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440
configuration

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.670
configuration and by the way yeah we can introduce if

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680
and by the way yeah we can introduce if

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.910
and by the way yeah we can introduce if u this u matures which are available out

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920
u this u matures which are available out

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.990
u this u matures which are available out of the box m sure are not uh satisfying

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000
of the box m sure are not uh satisfying

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.670
of the box m sure are not uh satisfying your needs and you would like to

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680
your needs and you would like to

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.870
your needs and you would like to introduce another mure uh maybe by query

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880
introduce another mure uh maybe by query

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.750
introduce another mure uh maybe by query u query parameter or u something like

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760
u query parameter or u something like

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.430
u query parameter or u something like something specific You may u

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440
something specific You may u

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.309
something specific You may u u extend this with the matcher you you

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319
u extend this with the matcher you you

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:35.670
u extend this with the matcher you you would like to have by some specific u

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680
would like to have by some specific u

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.430
would like to have by some specific u criteria

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440
criteria

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.910
criteria and by the way we can specify the order

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920
and by the way we can specify the order

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.589
and by the way we can specify the order uh by which we would like to match uh uh

01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599
uh by which we would like to match uh uh

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:46.069
uh by which we would like to match uh uh what matcher should trigger first. So

01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079
what matcher should trigger first. So

01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:48.710
what matcher should trigger first. So first triggers environment variable uh

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720
first triggers environment variable uh

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.950
first triggers environment variable uh based match then cookie based and then

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960
based match then cookie based and then

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.349
based match then cookie based and then URL. So if we for instance have a cookie

01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359
URL. So if we for instance have a cookie

01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:57.190
URL. So if we for instance have a cookie based then uh and both URL uh then

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200
based then uh and both URL uh then

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.510
based then uh and both URL uh then cookie will trigger the first uh here is

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520
cookie will trigger the first uh here is

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.630
cookie will trigger the first uh here is the option uh by which we can define

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640
the option uh by which we can define

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.309
the option uh by which we can define what cookie to use for cookie matcher

01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319
what cookie to use for cookie matcher

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:11.270
what cookie to use for cookie matcher and uh actually let's let's check how it

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280
and uh actually let's let's check how it

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.549
and uh actually let's let's check how it works. I will use this website let it be

01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559
works. I will use this website let it be

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:18.549
works. I will use this website let it be cookie and I will u demonstrate how

01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559
cookie and I will u demonstrate how

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:22.150
cookie and I will u demonstrate how works uh this cookie based uh matcher.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160
works uh this cookie based uh matcher.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.349
works uh this cookie based uh matcher. Okay. And now for your website I would

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359
Okay. And now for your website I would

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:29.109
Okay. And now for your website I would like to match it um

01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119
like to match it um

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:33.109
like to match it um by cookie.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:38.230
Okay. I will go to configuration

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.549
uh routing. Okay. So we have this URL

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559
uh routing. Okay. So we have this URL

01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:46.789
uh routing. Okay. So we have this URL right and uh I would like to specify one

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799
right and uh I would like to specify one

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:50.470
right and uh I would like to specify one two three let it be cookie value. So if

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480
two three let it be cookie value. So if

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:57.910
two three let it be cookie value. So if I has okay let's make it more meaningful

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.349
Europe. Oops sorry.

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359
Europe. Oops sorry.

01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:04.710
Europe. Oops sorry. Okay. So whenever I have a within a

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720
Okay. So whenever I have a within a

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.950
Okay. So whenever I have a within a request I have a cookie named website

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960
request I have a cookie named website

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.230
request I have a cookie named website with a cookie value name um equal to

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240
with a cookie value name um equal to

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.549
with a cookie value name um equal to Europe then I should uh be uh landed to

01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559
Europe then I should uh be uh landed to

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:19.670
Europe then I should uh be uh landed to the Europe website. Okay let's save the

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680
the Europe website. Okay let's save the

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.190
the Europe website. Okay let's save the changes. So I have saved the changes and

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200
changes. So I have saved the changes and

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.309
changes. So I have saved the changes and now let me go to the default website.

01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319
now let me go to the default website.

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:31.990
now let me go to the default website. Okay. So I have a default website. Now I

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000
Okay. So I have a default website. Now I

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.789
Okay. So I have a default website. Now I will uh edit cookies and I will add

01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799
will uh edit cookies and I will add

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:39.910
will uh edit cookies and I will add another cookie as we've seen website.

another cookie as we've seen website.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.230
another cookie as we've seen website. Okay. With the Europe

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240
Okay. With the Europe

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.109
Okay. With the Europe Europe I will enable it from okay

01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119
Europe I will enable it from okay

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:52.789
Europe I will enable it from okay now I have a website cookie

01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799
now I have a website cookie

01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:55.829
now I have a website cookie uh with the value Europe. Now I will

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480
which was specified here in the Europe

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:18.069
which was specified here in the Europe uh website configuration. It detected uh

01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079
uh website configuration. It detected uh

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:21.349
uh website configuration. It detected uh uh the Europe website and we were landed

01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359
uh the Europe website and we were landed

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:25.510

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.189
will I will use break and I will pin him to check.

01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199
to check.

01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:08.070
to check. Mhm.

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080
Mhm.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.790
Mhm. Okay. So we have a question or platform

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800
Okay. So we have a question or platform

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.790
Okay. So we have a question or platform is it uh back end uh correct with the

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800
is it uh back end uh correct with the

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.830
is it uh back end uh correct with the question uh mark. Uh so Oro platform

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840
question uh mark. Uh so Oro platform

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.990
question uh mark. Uh so Oro platform this is uh the the main package on top

01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000
this is uh the the main package on top

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.830
this is uh the the main package on top of which uh all other uh uh

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840
of which uh all other uh uh

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.630
of which uh all other uh uh functionality or capabilities are built

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640
functionality or capabilities are built

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.910
functionality or capabilities are built uh are built on. So we have like uh Ora

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920
uh are built on. So we have like uh Ora

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.310
uh are built on. So we have like uh Ora platform. Okay. So on top of Ouro

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320
platform. Okay. So on top of Ouro

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.350
platform. Okay. So on top of Ouro platform uh it uh we have CRM. Uh so uh

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360
platform uh it uh we have CRM. Uh so uh

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.630
platform uh it uh we have CRM. Uh so uh Oro platform is used for the uh Oro CRM.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640
Oro platform is used for the uh Oro CRM.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.189
Oro platform is used for the uh Oro CRM. You know this is like another uh

01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199
You know this is like another uh

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:49.030
You know this is like another uh application u u standalone application

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040
application u u standalone application

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.510
application u u standalone application we have in OraCommerce. Then again on

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520
we have in OraCommerce. Then again on

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.709
we have in OraCommerce. Then again on top of uh Oro platform we have

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719
top of uh Oro platform we have

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:57.910
top of uh Oro platform we have Orocommerce and uh we also have like Oro

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920
Orocommerce and uh we also have like Oro

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.350
Orocommerce and uh we also have like Oro marketplace but this is kind of not u uh

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360
marketplace but this is kind of not u uh

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.990
marketplace but this is kind of not u uh not a standalone but just a

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000
not a standalone but just a

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.030
not a standalone but just a customization for the Orocommerce. Uh

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040
customization for the Orocommerce. Uh

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.070
customization for the Orocommerce. Uh that's u just a short description. So

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080
that's u just a short description. So

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.070
that's u just a short description. So answering your question, this is not

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080
answering your question, this is not

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.750
answering your question, this is not kind of a a back end uh feature but

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760
kind of a a back end uh feature but

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.149
kind of a a back end uh feature but rather uh framework or uh the the

01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159
rather uh framework or uh the the

01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:24.630
rather uh framework or uh the the starting point the main uh the main uh

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640
starting point the main uh the main uh

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.270
starting point the main uh the main uh package for all other uh oro u

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280
package for all other uh oro u

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.430
package for all other uh oro u functionality for other oro extensions.

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440
functionality for other oro extensions.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.750
functionality for other oro extensions. uh we can actually check uh it provides

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760
uh we can actually check uh it provides

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.470
uh we can actually check uh it provides the ability to for the data grid if I'm

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480
the ability to for the data grid if I'm

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.630
the ability to for the data grid if I'm not mistaken some uh security uh things

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640
not mistaken some uh security uh things

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.630
not mistaken some uh security uh things uh should be there like common

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640
uh should be there like common

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.310
uh should be there like common functionality that then is reused uh in

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320
functionality that then is reused uh in

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.590
functionality that then is reused uh in both Orocommerce or CRM or marketplace

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600
both Orocommerce or CRM or marketplace

01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.790
both Orocommerce or CRM or marketplace and so on. Okay, one second.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800
and so on. Okay, one second.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.910
and so on. Okay, one second. Platform

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:14.310
bundle.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.870
Okay. So, a bunch of them. So uh bundles

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880
Okay. So, a bunch of them. So uh bundles

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.750
Okay. So, a bunch of them. So uh bundles as I mentioned here data grid uh

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760
as I mentioned here data grid uh

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.590
as I mentioned here data grid uh dashboard

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600
dashboard

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.990
dashboard uh some uh adding comments uh actually

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000
uh some uh adding comments uh actually

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.790
uh some uh adding comments uh actually yeah this part is uh in a in a back

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800
yeah this part is uh in a in a back

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.070
yeah this part is uh in a in a back office managing digital assets uh

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080
office managing digital assets uh

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.630
office managing digital assets uh managing entities. So yeah, this is

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:36.640
managing entities. So yeah, this is

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.149
managing entities. So yeah, this is actually the root uh the main package uh

01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159
actually the root uh the main package uh

01:14:40.159 --> 01:14:45.430
actually the root uh the main package uh uh for all other packages.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.950
Uh

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960
Uh

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.030
Uh okay. Do we have a separate servers

01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040
okay. Do we have a separate servers

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.070
okay. Do we have a separate servers running per website? Uh uh

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080
running per website? Uh uh

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.350
running per website? Uh uh no you should not have uh like different

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360
no you should not have uh like different

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.870
no you should not have uh like different uh

01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880
uh

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.110
uh actually if you have different servers

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120
actually if you have different servers

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.510
actually if you have different servers running different uh website then you

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520
running different uh website then you

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.110
running different uh website then you would need to maintain all those servers

01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120
would need to maintain all those servers

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.149
would need to maintain all those servers uh like uh deploy uh fresh code new

01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159
uh like uh deploy uh fresh code new

01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:15.110
uh like uh deploy uh fresh code new updates of your code uh like maybe

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120
updates of your code uh like maybe

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.270
updates of your code uh like maybe keeping sync if there is some need of

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280
keeping sync if there is some need of

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.590
keeping sync if there is some need of interaction between websites uh

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600
interaction between websites uh

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.430
interaction between websites uh exchanging data. But uh the main idea uh

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440
exchanging data. But uh the main idea uh

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.070
exchanging data. But uh the main idea uh of orcommerce websites is that you are

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080
of orcommerce websites is that you are

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.830
of orcommerce websites is that you are using single application, single server

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840
using single application, single server

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.310
using single application, single server u instance of the server and uh applica

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320
u instance of the server and uh applica

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.270
u instance of the server and uh applica websites are running on it. you would

01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280
websites are running on it. you would

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.750
websites are running on it. you would need just to configure for instance not

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760
need just to configure for instance not

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.709
need just to configure for instance not for instance but just uh have DNS

01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719
for instance but just uh have DNS

01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:45.910
for instance but just uh have DNS records uh for different websites but

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920
records uh for different websites but

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.229
records uh for different websites but they will be for instance uh Europe

01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239
they will be for instance uh Europe

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:51.910
they will be for instance uh Europe website and Canada website.com

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920
website and Canada website.com

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.669
website and Canada website.com they are uh referring uh both to the

01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679
they are uh referring uh both to the

01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:59.750
they are uh referring uh both to the same uh server and server running or

01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760
same uh server and server running or

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.430
same uh server and server running or commerce application it detects the URL

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440
commerce application it detects the URL

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.950
commerce application it detects the URL and provides uh for the end user

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960
and provides uh for the end user

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.550
and provides uh for the end user proper website to be landed to.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.189
Uh is it work fine under the docker

01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199
Uh is it work fine under the docker

01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:18.070

the CRM right for the CRM is a completely different dashboard or is it

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040
completely different dashboard or is it

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.110
completely different dashboard or is it all handled under the same one?

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.189
understood. And about the B2C enabling or disabling,

01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199
And about the B2C enabling or disabling,

01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:46.390
And about the B2C enabling or disabling, you mentioned that there are some

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400
you mentioned that there are some

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.870
you mentioned that there are some features that we can enable or disable

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880
features that we can enable or disable

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.830
features that we can enable or disable like for example um quotes, right? The

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840
like for example um quotes, right? The

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.750
like for example um quotes, right? The quoting, we can enable or disable that

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760
quoting, we can enable or disable that

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.030
quoting, we can enable or disable that for the B2C.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040
for the B2C.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:55.430
for the B2C. Yes.

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440
Yes.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.350
Yes. Um but can we do that differently for

01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360
Um but can we do that differently for

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.149
Um but can we do that differently for the different uh store views? Let's say

01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159
the different uh store views? Let's say

01:19:02.159 --> 01:19:05.270
the different uh store views? Let's say I have my site for the US and my site

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280
I have my site for the US and my site

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.470
I have my site for the US and my site for Germany and I want to enable B2C in

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480
for Germany and I want to enable B2C in

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.830
for Germany and I want to enable B2C in both sides. And but in US I want to keep

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840
both sides. And but in US I want to keep

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.830
both sides. And but in US I want to keep the quoting but in Germany I want to

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840
the quoting but in Germany I want to

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.750
the quoting but in Germany I want to disable the quoting for the B2C I'm

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760
disable the quoting for the B2C I'm

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.669
disable the quoting for the B2C I'm talking about. So can we do that

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679
talking about. So can we do that

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:19.430
talking about. So can we do that separately for each branch?

01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440
separately for each branch?

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:23.189
separately for each branch? Yes. Yep. You can do it and actually

01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199
Yes. Yep. You can do it and actually

01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:26.550
Yes. Yep. You can do it and actually using website uh configuration level. So

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560
using website uh configuration level. So

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.990
using website uh configuration level. So this is something that I am just

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000
this is something that I am just

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.630
this is something that I am just demonstrating. So go into system

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640
demonstrating. So go into system

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.189
demonstrating. So go into system websites and either go into

01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199
websites and either go into

01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:37.189
websites and either go into configuration uh let's pick up uh uh

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199
configuration uh let's pick up uh uh

01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:40.070
configuration uh let's pick up uh uh Australia either from here here we have

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080
Australia either from here here we have

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.870
Australia either from here here we have a configuration right or another thing

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880
a configuration right or another thing

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.669
a configuration right or another thing we can go to website configuration

01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679
we can go to website configuration

01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:49.830
we can go to website configuration through this part uh under uh website uh

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840
through this part uh under uh website uh

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.590
through this part uh under uh website uh view page okay I am clicking to uh

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600
view page okay I am clicking to uh

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.189
view page okay I am clicking to uh configuration so now I am configuring uh

01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199
configuration so now I am configuring uh

01:19:57.199 --> 01:20:00.149
configuration so now I am configuring uh options or settings uh specifically for

01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159
options or settings uh specifically for

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:03.270
options or settings uh specifically for the Australia uh website. And now I will

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280
the Australia uh website. And now I will

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.350
the Australia uh website. And now I will go to quick

01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360
go to quick

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.550
go to quick order form. And here we have those

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560
order form. And here we have those

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.790
order form. And here we have those settings uh just as an example. So

01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800
settings uh just as an example. So

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.229
settings uh just as an example. So imagine I have uh enabled uh for for

01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239
imagine I have uh enabled uh for for

01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:16.630
imagine I have uh enabled uh for for others website while I would like to

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:16.640
others website while I would like to

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.950
others website while I would like to keep it disabled uh for uh for this

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960
keep it disabled uh for uh for this

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.669
keep it disabled uh for uh for this Australia website. So it will uh be

01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679
Australia website. So it will uh be

01:20:23.679 --> 01:20:25.910
Australia website. So it will uh be applied only if Australia.

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920
applied only if Australia.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.590
applied only if Australia. Yeah. And uh yeah and just one thing u

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600
Yeah. And uh yeah and just one thing u

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.470
Yeah. And uh yeah and just one thing u enabling u B2C

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480
enabling u B2C

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.189
enabling u B2C it simply does uh it uh the same for you

01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199
it simply does uh it uh the same for you

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:41.510
it simply does uh it uh the same for you uh just uh in a quicker way and it will

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520
uh just uh in a quicker way and it will

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.229
uh just uh in a quicker way and it will also uh the the whole idea is while

01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239
also uh the the whole idea is while

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:47.910
also uh the the whole idea is while enabling B2C is to have this uh options

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920
enabling B2C is to have this uh options

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.310
enabling B2C is to have this uh options uh either enabled, disabled, checked

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320
uh either enabled, disabled, checked

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.950
uh either enabled, disabled, checked unchecked according to BTC website but

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960
unchecked according to BTC website but

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.229
unchecked according to BTC website but for you without going manually uh option

01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239
for you without going manually uh option

01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:58.630
for you without going manually uh option by option and specifying it on your own.

01:20:58.630 --> 01:20:58.640
by option and specifying it on your own.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.189
by option and specifying it on your own. So it will just do it automatically but

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199
So it will just do it automatically but

01:21:01.199 --> 01:21:03.189
So it will just do it automatically but again it will be performed specifically

01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199
again it will be performed specifically

01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:07.669
again it will be performed specifically for the website uh configuration level.

01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679
for the website uh configuration level.

01:21:07.679 --> 01:21:10.149
for the website uh configuration level. Got it. So all B2C options are done at

01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159
Got it. So all B2C options are done at

01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:12.390
Got it. So all B2C options are done at website level. Perfect.

01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400
website level. Perfect.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:12.950
website level. Perfect. Yes.

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960
Yes.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.149
Yes. Mhm.

01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159
Mhm.

01:21:14.159 --> 01:21:16.950
Mhm. Okay. Uh and one last uh quick question

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960
Okay. Uh and one last uh quick question

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.630
Okay. Uh and one last uh quick question when you were talking about the theme,

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:18.640
when you were talking about the theme,

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.550
when you were talking about the theme, the custom themes,

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560
the custom themes,

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.550
the custom themes, um those can be different for each

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560
um those can be different for each

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.070
um those can be different for each website, but uh is there a possibility

01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080
website, but uh is there a possibility

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.430
website, but uh is there a possibility of making them different for B2C option?

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440
of making them different for B2C option?

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.430
of making them different for B2C option? I I guess not because B2C is not a

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440
I I guess not because B2C is not a

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.350
I I guess not because B2C is not a separate website. It's just a some

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360
separate website. It's just a some

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.110
separate website. It's just a some options, right? According to the level,

01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120
options, right? According to the level,

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.709
options, right? According to the level, the role the role of the user. Uh but if

01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719
the role the role of the user. Uh but if

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:40.470
the role the role of the user. Uh but if I would like to have a separate a

01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480
I would like to have a separate a

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.070
I would like to have a separate a different theme for the V versus the B2C

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080
different theme for the V versus the B2C

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.070
different theme for the V versus the B2C that is that is not possible right at

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080
that is that is not possible right at

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.149
that is that is not possible right at least not out of the box.

01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159
least not out of the box.

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:50.630
least not out of the box. Yes it it is possible. So out of the box

01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640
Yes it it is possible. So out of the box

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.350
Yes it it is possible. So out of the box we have like two themes uh the default

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360
we have like two themes uh the default

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.590
we have like two themes uh the default one and the custom theme. You can

01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600
one and the custom theme. You can

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.110
one and the custom theme. You can introduce your own theme uh on top of uh

01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120
introduce your own theme uh on top of uh

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.110
introduce your own theme uh on top of uh existing one uh and then uh assign this

01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120
existing one uh and then uh assign this

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.830
existing one uh and then uh assign this theme to and you can have as many themes

01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840
theme to and you can have as many themes

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.350
theme to and you can have as many themes as you would like to have like for

01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360
as you would like to have like for

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.070
as you would like to have like for instance uh six uh we have here six

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080
instance uh six uh we have here six

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.270
instance uh six uh we have here six right uh six websites you may have six

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280
right uh six websites you may have six

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.990
right uh six websites you may have six different uh themes uh per each

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000
different uh themes uh per each

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.590
different uh themes uh per each individual website. Then just the next

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600
individual website. Then just the next

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.310
individual website. Then just the next step would be just you have them then

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320
step would be just you have them then

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.430
step would be just you have them then you assign those themes to the websites

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440
you assign those themes to the websites

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.790
you assign those themes to the websites using again uh configuration.

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800
using again uh configuration.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.950
using again uh configuration. Uh here we have theme. We will talk a

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960
Uh here we have theme. We will talk a

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.149
Uh here we have theme. We will talk a bit in a moment about themes but just uh

website. Now if I go to uh

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.750
website. Now if I go to uh and it uses custom team okay while uh uh

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760
and it uses custom team okay while uh uh

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.590
and it uses custom team okay while uh uh okay

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.229
this is actually the top the next topic

01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239
this is actually the top the next topic

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:27.990
this is actually the top the next topic but let's check very quickly. uh theme

01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000
but let's check very quickly. uh theme

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.550
but let's check very quickly. uh theme on a global level I have a default

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560
on a global level I have a default

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.990

and uh global and actually the default

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.030
and uh global and actually the default website will have default theme. Now if

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040
website will have default theme. Now if

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.870
website will have default theme. Now if I am on a Europe website, uh one second.

01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880
I am on a Europe website, uh one second.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.709
I am on a Europe website, uh one second. Uh

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719
Uh

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:47.270
Uh this is the one

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280
this is the one

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:55.030
this is the one routing.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.870
Okay. You see with the blue uh different

01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880
Okay. You see with the blue uh different

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.270
Okay. You see with the blue uh different uh font uh colors, weight uh different

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280
uh font uh colors, weight uh different

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.070
uh font uh colors, weight uh different position. Uh this is how custom team

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080
position. Uh this is how custom team

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.270
position. Uh this is how custom team which was assigned to Europe website. Uh

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280
which was assigned to Europe website. Uh

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.149
which was assigned to Europe website. Uh imagine so this is a B2C for instance

01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159
imagine so this is a B2C for instance

01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:16.790
imagine so this is a B2C for instance while the default one uh

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800
while the default one uh

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.430
while the default one uh ah we are using cookie remember we have

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440
ah we are using cookie remember we have

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.709
ah we are using cookie remember we have added that cookie now it simply matches

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719
added that cookie now it simply matches

01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:26.629
added that cookie now it simply matches me one second I would need to

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639
me one second I would need to

01:24:26.639 --> 01:24:27.430
me one second I would need to uh to

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440
uh to

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.750
uh to yeah no worries. So I think I understand

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760
yeah no worries. So I think I understand

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.830
yeah no worries. So I think I understand now. My confusion was because I thought

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840
now. My confusion was because I thought

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.790
now. My confusion was because I thought that B2C customers would be under the

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800
that B2C customers would be under the

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.030
that B2C customers would be under the same website but um as as uh Nicholas is

uh theme but though this is running on

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.070
uh theme but though this is running on the same uh on the same uh application

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080
the same uh on the same uh application

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:28.709
the same uh on the same uh application Yeah.

Yes. And that but um B2C customers will be under the same

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920
um B2C customers will be under the same

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.629
um B2C customers will be under the same website as the B2B customers because

01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639
website as the B2B customers because

01:25:38.639 --> 01:25:41.350
website as the B2B customers because it's let's say Germany. So I have the

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.229
it's let's say Germany. So I have the B2B for Germany and then I have the B2C

01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239
B2B for Germany and then I have the B2C

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.470
B2B for Germany and then I have the B2C customers also for Germany. So it is the

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480
customers also for Germany. So it is the

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.669
customers also for Germany. So it is the same website. How is it possible for B2C

same website. How is it possible for B2C

01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:52.229
same website. How is it possible for B2C customers to see a different theme if it

01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239

correct. Okay then uh the next question

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.629
correct. Okay then uh the next question uh which pops up what kind of separation

01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639
uh which pops up what kind of separation

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:14.629
uh which pops up what kind of separation you would like to have between do these

Should it be uh the for instance uh just as an example different products right

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600
as an example different products right

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.189
as an example different products right you for instance you would like to

01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199
you for instance you would like to

01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:34.229
you for instance you would like to present on the same website uh different

present on the same website uh different products uh for one types for B2C users

01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880
products uh for one types for B2C users

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.110
products uh for one types for B2C users you would like to present one set of one

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120
you would like to present one set of one

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.430
you would like to present one set of one list of products but for B2B you would

like to to present another list of products right

01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239
products right

01:26:44.239 --> 01:26:44.709
products right for example

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719
for example

01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:47.990
for example okay yeah as an example so we do have a

01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000
okay yeah as an example so we do have a

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.430
okay yeah as an example so we do have a a configuration for that on a products

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440
a configuration for that on a products

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.310
a configuration for that on a products on a categories uh level to configure

01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320
on a categories uh level to configure

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.149
on a categories uh level to configure visibility. So you will be running the

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159
visibility. So you will be running the

01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:58.550
visibility. So you will be running the same website but depending on user they

01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560
same website but depending on user they

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.070
same website but depending on user they will see different uh uh different uh

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080
will see different uh uh different uh

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.750
will see different uh uh different uh uh different list of products.

Yeah. Another another separation might

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.310
Yeah. Another another separation might be different content. Again if we are

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320
be different content. Again if we are

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.870

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.310
to the uh content management and uh define uh per which uh group of

01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320
define uh per which uh group of

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.149
define uh per which uh group of customers we would like to present one

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159
customers we would like to present one

01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:28.070
customers we would like to present one content per which we would like to

01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080
content per which we would like to

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.270
content per which we would like to present another.

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280
present another.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.990
present another. Yeah. And so here we have like the the

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000
Yeah. And so here we have like the the

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.030
Yeah. And so here we have like the the ability the flexibility to to configure

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040
ability the flexibility to to configure

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.430
ability the flexibility to to configure but again yeah we have like one website

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440
but again yeah we have like one website

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.510
but again yeah we have like one website which has one options u one settings and

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520
which has one options u one settings and

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.310
which has one options u one settings and then depending on the on the needs then

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320
then depending on the on the needs then

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.830
then depending on the on the needs then we are just trying to uh to separate uh

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840
we are just trying to uh to separate uh

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.790
we are just trying to uh to separate uh either content either flow uh for

01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800
either content either flow uh for

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.870
either content either flow uh for instance during checkout you might have

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880
instance during checkout you might have

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.189
instance during checkout you might have to approve for B2B to approve some uh to

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199
to approve for B2B to approve some uh to

01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:59.270
to approve for B2B to approve some uh to be products uh which are in a checkout

01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280
be products uh which are in a checkout

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.430
be products uh which are in a checkout to be approved by some manager. While

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440
to be approved by some manager. While

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.510
to be approved by some manager. While for B2C, you would like to have like

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520
for B2C, you would like to have like

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.950
for B2C, you would like to have like single page uh single page checkout. Uh

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960
single page uh single page checkout. Uh

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.189
single page uh single page checkout. Uh no need for any approval, no need for

01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199
no need for any approval, no need for

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:12.310
no need for any approval, no need for additional steps. Again, this is uh this

01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320
additional steps. Again, this is uh this

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.430
additional steps. Again, this is uh this is something that could be configured uh

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440
is something that could be configured uh

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.950
is something that could be configured uh uh

01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960
uh

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.350
uh from partially from back office,

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360
from partially from back office,

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.390
from partially from back office, partially from customization. So it all

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400
partially from customization. So it all

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.790
partially from customization. So it all depends uh

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800
depends uh

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.510
depends uh uh so if you provide some specific case

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520
uh so if you provide some specific case

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.390
uh so if you provide some specific case how you would like uh to separate the

01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400
how you would like uh to separate the

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.870
how you would like uh to separate the same website per different users I would

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880
same website per different users I would

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.830
same website per different users I would provide you the hints where it could be

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840
provide you the hints where it could be

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.470
provide you the hints where it could be tuned.

01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480
tuned.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.189
tuned. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Let's let's move

01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Let's let's move

01:28:41.199 --> 01:28:42.709
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Let's let's move on.

01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719
on.

01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:45.510
on. Okay. Then we have uh

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520
Okay. Then we have uh

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.750
Okay. Then we have uh additional questions. just want to just

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760
additional questions. just want to just

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.390
additional questions. just want to just are we recording uh sorry on B2B and B2C

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400
are we recording uh sorry on B2B and B2C

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.110
are we recording uh sorry on B2B and B2C will be on separate websites correct uh

01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120
will be on separate websites correct uh

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.310
will be on separate websites correct uh so I guess we have just uh discussed uh

01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320
so I guess we have just uh discussed uh

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.110
so I guess we have just uh discussed uh usually better to to put them on on

01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120
usually better to to put them on on

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.189
usually better to to put them on on separate websites

01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199
separate websites

01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:05.189
separate websites I I guess it would be uh more convenient

01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199
I I guess it would be uh more convenient

01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:07.830
I I guess it would be uh more convenient from configuration standpoint so

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840
from configuration standpoint so

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.830
from configuration standpoint so different websites might have different

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840
different websites might have different

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:13.590
different websites might have different uh uh workflows checkout workflow and it

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600
uh uh workflows checkout workflow and it

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.830
uh uh workflows checkout workflow and it will be more easier to to separate but

01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840
will be more easier to to separate but

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.110
will be more easier to to separate but If um the question is about uh only some

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120
If um the question is about uh only some

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.510
If um the question is about uh only some content presenting content uh uh

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520
content presenting content uh uh

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.350
content presenting content uh uh uh then it could be configured by the

01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360
uh then it could be configured by the

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.590
uh then it could be configured by the same website.

01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600
same website.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.470
same website. Uh we are not recording uh to the rules

01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480
Uh we are not recording uh to the rules

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.350
Uh we are not recording uh to the rules of the training u which is not set by me

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360
of the training u which is not set by me

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.430
of the training u which is not set by me actually. Uh this is not uh this is not

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440
actually. Uh this is not uh this is not

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.110
actually. Uh this is not uh this is not allowed

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120
allowed

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.110
allowed the recording

01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120
the recording

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.110
the recording uh but you cannot have a different team

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120
uh but you cannot have a different team

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.750
uh but you cannot have a different team based on customer group. Uh

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760
based on customer group. Uh

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.550
based on customer group. Uh I would uh check it. Uh I would check

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560
I would uh check it. Uh I would check

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.110
I would uh check it. Uh I would check it. So we have on a uh so we have

01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120
it. So we have on a uh so we have

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.270
it. So we have on a uh so we have different types answering your question

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280
different types answering your question

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.830
different types answering your question uh Nicholas. So we have like uh

01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840
uh Nicholas. So we have like uh

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.790
uh Nicholas. So we have like uh different levels of configuration uh

01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800
different levels of configuration uh

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.790
different levels of configuration uh global

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800
global

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.950
global website also customer group and customer

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960
website also customer group and customer

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.709
website also customer group and customer and need to check uh whether on a

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719
and need to check uh whether on a

01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:12.390
and need to check uh whether on a customer group. Okay, this is actually a

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400
customer group. Okay, this is actually a

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.149
customer group. Okay, this is actually a bit another topic but we will check

01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159
bit another topic but we will check

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:16.790
bit another topic but we will check right now. So on a customer group we

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800
right now. So on a customer group we

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.070
right now. So on a customer group we have like a set of uh a set of

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.350
settings available. uh out of the box

01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360
settings available. uh out of the box

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.629
settings available. uh out of the box you see that uh uh theme is not exposed

01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639
you see that uh uh theme is not exposed

01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:34.390
you see that uh uh theme is not exposed as a customer group configuration but uh

01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400
as a customer group configuration but uh

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.189
as a customer group configuration but uh configurations they could be easily uh

01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199
configurations they could be easily uh

01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:40.629
configurations they could be easily uh extended with uh from code I mean from

01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639
extended with uh from code I mean from

01:30:40.639 --> 01:30:43.110
extended with uh from code I mean from with additional settings and then uh you

01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120
with additional settings and then uh you

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.550
with additional settings and then uh you can use this settings for per the web

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560
can use this settings for per the web

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.270
can use this settings for per the web per the

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280
per the

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.510
per the different customer groups we will check

01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520
different customer groups we will check

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.030
different customer groups we will check uh how themes and layouts work. So

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040
uh how themes and layouts work. So

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.669
uh how themes and layouts work. So answering your question, out of the box,

01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679
answering your question, out of the box,

01:30:57.679 --> 01:31:00.149
answering your question, out of the box, no, but it could be customized using

01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159
no, but it could be customized using

01:31:00.159 --> 01:31:02.950
no, but it could be customized using customer groups settings.

01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960
customer groups settings.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.870
customer groups settings. Uh

01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880
Uh

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.709
Uh okay, we can wait. Um okay, so let's uh

01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719
okay, we can wait. Um okay, so let's uh

01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:13.110
okay, we can wait. Um okay, so let's uh then uh take a 10 minutes break. Uh 10

01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120
then uh take a 10 minutes break. Uh 10

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.270
then uh take a 10 minutes break. Uh 10 minutes break and then uh continue with

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280
minutes break and then uh continue with

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.950
minutes break and then uh continue with the

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960
the

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.629
the uh with the themes and layouts this one.

So, let's continue.

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:07.990
So, let's continue. 10 minutes has passed.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.550
One second. I will open slides for the

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560
One second. I will open slides for the

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:22.550
One second. I will open slides for the next topic.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.870
Let me close those parts which are not

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880
Let me close those parts which are not

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.510
Let me close those parts which are not relevant anymore.

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520
relevant anymore.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.189
relevant anymore. Yeah, we're back.

01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199
Yeah, we're back.

01:32:31.199 --> 01:32:33.669
Yeah, we're back. Okay, let's start then. Not start

01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679
Okay, let's start then. Not start

01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:35.189
Okay, let's start then. Not start actually but continue. So we have a

01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199
actually but continue. So we have a

01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:37.990
actually but continue. So we have a website, we have a storefront. User is

01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000
website, we have a storefront. User is

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.830
website, we have a storefront. User is navigating over u the website over the

01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840
navigating over u the website over the

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.110
navigating over u the website over the storefront and purchases some products.

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120

01:38:03.199 --> 01:38:05.750
me I will enable consumers for them to be running.

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760
be running.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:09.910
be running. Actually it doesn't matter right now but

01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920
Actually it doesn't matter right now but

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:17.669
Actually it doesn't matter right now but not to forget.

01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:19.350
Okay.

01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360
Okay.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.950
Okay. Uh global configuration. Um so system

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960
Uh global configuration. Um so system

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.550
Uh global configuration. Um so system configuration

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560
configuration

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.070
configuration and navigateing to theme

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080
and navigateing to theme

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.310
and navigateing to theme we have these two themes default and

01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320
we have these two themes default and

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.830
we have these two themes default and custom. The difference is

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840
custom. The difference is

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.189
custom. The difference is following. This is the default one

01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199
following. This is the default one

01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:40.709
following. This is the default one and this is a custom one. How they are

01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719
and this is a custom one. How they are

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:45.189
and this is a custom one. How they are defined uh in a in a code.

01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199
defined uh in a in a code.

01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:50.470
defined uh in a in a code. Uh let's go to this thing.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.470
Actually this is one of the packages

01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480
Actually this is one of the packages

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.189
Actually this is one of the packages which we were talking uh before uh

01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199
which we were talking uh before uh

01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:57.830
which we were talking uh before uh customer portal uh package which was as

01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840
customer portal uh package which was as

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.629
customer portal uh package which was as I mentioned which is responsible for

01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639
I mentioned which is responsible for

01:39:00.639 --> 01:39:03.590
I mentioned which is responsible for storefront part especially like look and

01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600
storefront part especially like look and

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.470
storefront part especially like look and feel account section and so on and uh

01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480
feel account section and so on and uh

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.030
feel account section and so on and uh here we have this front end bundle which

01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040
here we have this front end bundle which

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.390
here we have this front end bundle which actually responsible for defining u

01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400
actually responsible for defining u

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.790
actually responsible for defining u additional themes for the front end for

01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800
additional themes for the front end for

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.709
additional themes for the front end for the storefront

01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719
the storefront

01:39:16.719 --> 01:39:19.669
the storefront and um

01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679
and um

01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:22.149
and um so Here is the list uh not not the list

01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159
so Here is the list uh not not the list

01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:25.189
so Here is the list uh not not the list the files which are uh related to the

01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199
the files which are uh related to the

01:39:25.199 --> 01:39:28.550
the files which are uh related to the default theme. As you may noticed that

01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560
default theme. As you may noticed that

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.590
default theme. As you may noticed that the theme itself it is located under

01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600
the theme itself it is located under

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.950
the theme itself it is located under resources view layouts. This is common

01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960
resources view layouts. This is common

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.590
resources view layouts. This is common uh path which is used for all the themes

01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600
uh path which is used for all the themes

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.189
uh path which is used for all the themes and the key point is that uh under

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199
and the key point is that uh under

01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:44.790
and the key point is that uh under layouts we should have a uh folder with

01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800
layouts we should have a uh folder with

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.669
layouts we should have a uh folder with the name of the theme. Uh in this case

01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679
the name of the theme. Uh in this case

01:39:47.679 --> 01:39:49.990
the name of the theme. Uh in this case we have a default theme and it is

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000
we have a default theme and it is

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.990
we have a default theme and it is located under uh layouts uh in a default

01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000
located under uh layouts uh in a default

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.510
located under uh layouts uh in a default folder

01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520
folder

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.629
folder uh what kind of uh files and folders we

01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639
uh what kind of uh files and folders we

01:39:58.639 --> 01:40:01.590
uh what kind of uh files and folders we have uh

01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600
have uh

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.470
have uh for the theme uh and responsible for

01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480
for the theme uh and responsible for

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.030
for the theme uh and responsible for that. So we have uh first of all we have

01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040
that. So we have uh first of all we have

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.750
that. So we have uh first of all we have this theme YAML file and this is the

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760
this theme YAML file and this is the

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.109
this theme YAML file and this is the file where uh the definition the main

01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119
file where uh the definition the main

01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:17.430
file where uh the definition the main definition of the theme listed uh the

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440
definition of the theme listed uh the

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.910
definition of the theme listed uh the definition itself uh contains of the

01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920
definition itself uh contains of the

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.270

label of the theme uh default theme and I think this is it what we've see uh

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239
I think this is it what we've see uh

01:40:26.239 --> 01:40:29.270
I think this is it what we've see uh what is um the label which we see then

01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280
what is um the label which we see then

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.270
what is um the label which we see then in configuration

01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280
in configuration

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.510
in configuration then we have some description um this is

01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520
then we have some description um this is

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.990
then we have some description um this is uh the description of the theme. Then we

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000

some uh JavaScript related uh uh stuff.

01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880
uh JavaScript related uh uh stuff.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.790
uh JavaScript related uh uh stuff. Okay. And screens YML file it defines uh

01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800
Okay. And screens YML file it defines uh

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.189
Okay. And screens YML file it defines uh uh on what screens uh what kind of uh uh

01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199
uh on what screens uh what kind of uh uh

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:11.830
uh on what screens uh what kind of uh uh classes additional classes to use. And

01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840
classes additional classes to use. And

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.270
classes additional classes to use. And this is uh actually uh goes to the part

01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280
this is uh actually uh goes to the part

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.070
this is uh actually uh goes to the part that was to the question that was asked

01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080
that was to the question that was asked

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.830
that was to the question that was asked whether teams are uh responsive or not.

01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840
whether teams are uh responsive or not.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.350
whether teams are uh responsive or not. So it could be actually it is achieved

01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360
So it could be actually it is achieved

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.270
So it could be actually it is achieved using u uh

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280
using u uh

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.750
using u uh different styling uh styles for

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760
different styling uh styles for

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.669
different styling uh styles for different uh for different blocks.

01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679
different uh for different blocks.

01:43:35.679 --> 01:43:40.709
different uh for different blocks. Okay. And um

01:43:40.719 --> 01:43:47.030
we have uh the theme

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.310
um okay other part I will describe a bit

01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320
um okay other part I will describe a bit

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.950
um okay other part I will describe a bit later. So just keep in mind it has a

01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960
later. So just keep in mind it has a

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.709
later. So just keep in mind it has a definition it has some configuration and

01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719
definition it has some configuration and

01:43:56.719 --> 01:43:59.350
definition it has some configuration and other parts we will go in a second.

01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360
other parts we will go in a second.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.950
other parts we will go in a second. Let's check the difference with the

01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960
Let's check the difference with the

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.070
Let's check the difference with the custom team. Uh we have the second one

01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080
custom team. Uh we have the second one

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:08.149
custom team. Uh we have the second one we have out of the box.

01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:13.669
So this is a blue one this one.

01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:18.470
And uh the definition uh of the theme is

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480
And uh the definition uh of the theme is

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:23.430
And uh the definition uh of the theme is uh not so big as for the default uh not

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440
uh not so big as for the default uh not

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.070
uh not so big as for the default uh not only definition but also settings. And

01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080
only definition but also settings. And

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.189
only definition but also settings. And the reason for that is that uh this uh

01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199
the reason for that is that uh this uh

01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:32.149
the reason for that is that uh this uh custom theme it uses as a parent theme

01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159
custom theme it uses as a parent theme

01:44:32.159 --> 01:44:35.430
custom theme it uses as a parent theme the default one. So u here you may

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440
the default one. So u here you may

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:37.830
the default one. So u here you may notice that uh we have like additional

01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840
notice that uh we have like additional

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.030
notice that uh we have like additional settings parent uh which is defined for

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040
settings parent uh which is defined for

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:44.629
settings parent uh which is defined for the custom theme. That's why we uh we

01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639
the custom theme. That's why we uh we

01:44:44.639 --> 01:44:47.990
the custom theme. That's why we uh we will be using the default one. Uh when

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000
will be using the default one. Uh when

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.550
will be using the default one. Uh when custom theme is selected, we are using

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560
custom theme is selected, we are using

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.109
custom theme is selected, we are using the default theme and only those parts

01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119
the default theme and only those parts

01:44:53.119 --> 01:44:56.870
the default theme and only those parts which we would like to uh override uh

01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880
which we would like to uh override uh

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.350
which we would like to uh override uh only those parts are overwritten like

01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360
only those parts are overwritten like

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.070
only those parts are overwritten like this u font size uh font weight uh font

01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080
this u font size uh font weight uh font

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:10.149
this u font size uh font weight uh font itself u uh the position of the of the

01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159
itself u uh the position of the of the

01:45:10.159 --> 01:45:13.669
itself u uh the position of the of the blocks on the those parts. some colors

01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679
blocks on the those parts. some colors

01:45:13.679 --> 01:45:17.669
blocks on the those parts. some colors are overwritten and it actually overr uh

01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679
are overwritten and it actually overr uh

01:45:17.679 --> 01:45:21.830
are overwritten and it actually overr uh overrides using configuration. Uh so it

01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840
overrides using configuration. Uh so it

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.229
overrides using configuration. Uh so it has like a bit different uh stylings uh

01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239
has like a bit different uh stylings uh

01:45:26.239 --> 01:45:31.510
has like a bit different uh stylings uh style uh files. um

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.790
some other JS models which uh should

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800
some other JS models which uh should

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.430
some other JS models which uh should work u JS components which should work

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440
work u JS components which should work

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.149
work u JS components which should work specifically for the custom team and

01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159
specifically for the custom team and

01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:46.870
specifically for the custom team and uh other layout uh layout

01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880
uh other layout uh layout

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.990
uh other layout uh layout changes which we will go in a moment.

01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000
changes which we will go in a moment.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.270
changes which we will go in a moment. So the key point you have a default and

01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280
So the key point you have a default and

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.229
So the key point you have a default and this is a parent theme for the custom

01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239
this is a parent theme for the custom

01:45:58.239 --> 01:46:00.870
this is a parent theme for the custom custom theme it only overrides those

01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880
custom theme it only overrides those

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.910
custom theme it only overrides those parts which do not work uh for them for

01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920
parts which do not work uh for them for

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.310
parts which do not work uh for them for us to be in a default theme from the

01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320
us to be in a default theme from the

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.590
us to be in a default theme from the default theme sorry and we are changing

01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600
default theme sorry and we are changing

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.669
default theme sorry and we are changing only those which we would like to

01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679
only those which we would like to

only those which we would like to change.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.109
Uh yeah and for defining we should have

01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119
Uh yeah and for defining we should have

01:46:19.119 --> 01:46:20.550
Uh yeah and for defining we should have uh so whenever we would like to

01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560
uh so whenever we would like to

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.950
uh so whenever we would like to introduce new theme it does not matter

01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960
introduce new theme it does not matter

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:26.070

01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280
actually as a recommendation we uh

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.790
actually as a recommendation we uh recommend uh for the for any uh theme

01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800
recommend uh for the for any uh theme

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.350
recommend uh for the for any uh theme changes or front end uh changes to

01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360
changes or front end uh changes to

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.990
changes or front end uh changes to introduce a separate bundle and uh

01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000
introduce a separate bundle and uh

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.830
introduce a separate bundle and uh within that separate bundle let's call

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840
within that separate bundle let's call

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:43.430
within that separate bundle let's call it also front end bundle or theme bundle

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440
it also front end bundle or theme bundle

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.149
it also front end bundle or theme bundle introduce uh uh yeah introduce

01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159
introduce uh uh yeah introduce

01:46:46.159 --> 01:46:49.350
introduce uh uh yeah introduce additional bundle and put uh all theme

01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360
additional bundle and put uh all theme

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.270
additional bundle and put uh all theme related uh uh changes uh definition

01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280
related uh uh changes uh definition

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.590
related uh uh changes uh definition there. So imagine you have you would

01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600
there. So imagine you have you would

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.750
there. So imagine you have you would like to have separate theme. The default

01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760
like to have separate theme. The default

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.390
like to have separate theme. The default and custom theme does not do not work

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400
and custom theme does not do not work

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.510
and custom theme does not do not work for you. You introduce a new bundle. Put

01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520
for you. You introduce a new bundle. Put

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.470
for you. You introduce a new bundle. Put under resources view the name of your

01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480
under resources view the name of your

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.310
under resources view the name of your theme. That's uh

01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320
theme. That's uh

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.629
theme. That's uh as an example

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639
as an example

01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:16.709
as an example uh some

01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719
uh some

01:47:16.719 --> 01:47:20.709
uh some AKMA or ABC theme. uh and on the theme

01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719
AKMA or ABC theme. uh and on the theme

01:47:20.719 --> 01:47:24.149
AKMA or ABC theme. uh and on the theme yl file you define uh the parent uh of

01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159
yl file you define uh the parent uh of

01:47:24.159 --> 01:47:28.790
yl file you define uh the parent uh of the theme and uh the name description

01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800
the theme and uh the name description

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.990
the theme and uh the name description and other related stuff. Uh if you do

01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000
and other related stuff. Uh if you do

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.310
and other related stuff. Uh if you do not define parent theme then you would

01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320
not define parent theme then you would

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.750
not define parent theme then you would need to uh

01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760
need to uh

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:43.590
need to uh uh to uh prepare uh layout u uh styling

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:43.600
uh to uh prepare uh layout u uh styling

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.830
uh to uh prepare uh layout u uh styling and uh all those how the website should

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840
and uh all those how the website should

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.870
and uh all those how the website should u should be presented on your own and it

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880
u should be presented on your own and it

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.430
u should be presented on your own and it might be time consuming I guess and uh

01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440
might be time consuming I guess and uh

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.550
might be time consuming I guess and uh so better idea is to take a default team

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560
so better idea is to take a default team

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.950
so better idea is to take a default team one of the default teams customer and

01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960
one of the default teams customer and

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.149
one of the default teams customer and and uh just uh tune it uh per your

01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159
and uh just uh tune it uh per your

01:48:04.159 --> 01:48:07.109
and uh just uh tune it uh per your needs. Otherwise, you would need to uh

01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119
needs. Otherwise, you would need to uh

01:48:07.119 --> 01:48:10.790
needs. Otherwise, you would need to uh list too many changes uh uh in your

01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800
list too many changes uh uh in your

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.669
list too many changes uh uh in your team.

01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679
team.

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.750
team. Okay. And once you have a theme, then

01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760
Okay. And once you have a theme, then

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.669
Okay. And once you have a theme, then you need to enable this theme to be uh

01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679
you need to enable this theme to be uh

01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:22.229
you need to enable this theme to be uh to be available in a uh in a

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239
to be available in a uh in a

01:48:22.239 --> 01:48:23.910
to be available in a uh in a configuration.

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920
configuration.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.430
configuration. Uh okay let's go through quickly uh

01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440
Uh okay let's go through quickly uh

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.629
Uh okay let's go through quickly uh through these links and I will check uh

01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639
through these links and I will check uh

01:48:30.639 --> 01:48:34.229
through these links and I will check uh what we have here.

01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239
what we have here.

01:48:34.239 --> 01:48:36.790
what we have here. Remember I was talking about oral

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800
Remember I was talking about oral

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.229
Remember I was talking about oral layout. Uh this is the uh root uh

01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239
layout. Uh this is the uh root uh

01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:42.950
layout. Uh this is the uh root uh configuration note root uh note of

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960
configuration note root uh note of

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.629
configuration note root uh note of configuration which is responsible for

01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639
configuration which is responsible for

01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:49.189
configuration which is responsible for the storefront uh theme changes. And uh

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199
the storefront uh theme changes. And uh

01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:51.669
the storefront uh theme changes. And uh here using this active team we can

01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679
here using this active team we can

01:48:51.679 --> 01:48:53.910
here using this active team we can define uh what kind of active team

01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920
define uh what kind of active team

01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:00.229
define uh what kind of active team should be uh out of the box uh uh in

01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239
should be uh out of the box uh uh in

01:49:00.239 --> 01:49:02.310
should be uh out of the box uh uh in in your application.

01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320
in your application.

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.669
in your application. Um this is this describes how to define

01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679
Um this is this describes how to define

need to enable it and for enabling uh we have uh for the back office remember Oro

01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840

this is not simply used just by

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.070
this is not simply used just by administrators. No need to have like

uh another theme for this uh for this

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.510
uh another theme for this uh for this configuration for this uh uh back office

01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520
configuration for this uh uh back office

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.030
configuration for this uh uh back office part.

01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040
part.

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.669
part. Um yeah, but if you introduce some uh

01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679
Um yeah, but if you introduce some uh

01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:10.470
Um yeah, but if you introduce some uh customization, some uh maybe some

actually this is uh the configuration for uh orcommerce application and we may

01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080
for uh orcommerce application and we may

options. So first of all using uh

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:30.550
options. So first of all using uh configuration YAML file using Oro layout

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560
configuration YAML file using Oro layout

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.189
configuration YAML file using Oro layout active theme u let's switch u

uh u perform these updates on different

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:59.270
uh u perform these updates on different instances and uh on local instance on

01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280
instances and uh on local instance on

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.589
instances and uh on local instance on development instance on stage instance

01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599
development instance on stage instance

01:53:01.599 --> 01:53:03.750
development instance on stage instance and you would like to have the same uh

01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760
and you would like to have the same uh

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:07.430
and you would like to have the same uh behavior uh the same settings not to set

behavior uh the same settings not to set

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.950
behavior uh the same settings not to set up them manually u yeah using system

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960
up them manually u yeah using system

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:12.709
up them manually u yeah using system configuration. So the migrations are

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719
configuration. So the migrations are

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:15.750
configuration. So the migrations are executed and you have the same state uh

01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760
executed and you have the same state uh

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.669
executed and you have the same state uh as another

01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679
as another

01:53:17.679 --> 01:53:20.950
as another uh as another instances

01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960
uh as another instances

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:24.310
uh as another instances and uh the um class which is or the

01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320
and uh the um class which is or the

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.510
and uh the um class which is or the service which is responsible for uh for

01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520
service which is responsible for uh for

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.390
service which is responsible for uh for the themes uh uh is uh called theme

01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400
the themes uh uh is uh called theme

manager uh you see it is located on the platform. So this is the main uh package

01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040
platform. So this is the main uh package

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.550
platform. So this is the main uh package uh for for other

01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560
uh for for other

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.910
uh for for other applications both back office uh uh uh

01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920
applications both back office uh uh uh

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.709
applications both back office uh uh uh part of application and storefront and

01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719
part of application and storefront and

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.990
them theme for the uh customer group uh you may refer to this theme manager and

01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000
you may refer to this theme manager and

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.390
you may refer to this theme manager and introducing

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400
introducing

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.550
introducing uh settings for the customer group

01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560
uh settings for the customer group

specifying some custom theme. uh then you may uh for instance check uh whether

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000
you may uh for instance check uh whether

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.669
you may uh for instance check uh whether team manager satisfies and picks up um a

01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679
team manager satisfies and picks up um a

01:54:35.679 --> 01:54:38.310
team manager satisfies and picks up um a specific theme for this uh particular

01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320
specific theme for this uh particular

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.870
specific theme for this uh particular customer group. If not uh maybe some

01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880
customer group. If not uh maybe some

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.350
customer group. If not uh maybe some customizations need need to be

01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360
customizations need need to be

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.990
customizations need need to be introduced. This is the the service I

01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000
introduced. This is the the service I

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.669
introduced. This is the the service I would recommend to start uh checking uh

01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679
would recommend to start uh checking uh

01:54:49.679 --> 01:54:54.310
would recommend to start uh checking uh uh for the theme manager. I mean uh how

01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320
uh for the theme manager. I mean uh how

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.270
uh for the theme manager. I mean uh how themes are final theme is prepared and

01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280
themes are final theme is prepared and

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:00.070
themes are final theme is prepared and how they are picked up. And by the way

01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080
how they are picked up. And by the way

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:03.990
how they are picked up. And by the way uh here is the uh

01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000
uh here is the uh

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.470
uh here is the uh the method which is responsible for

01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480
the method which is responsible for

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.589
the method which is responsible for emerging uh theme templates. And so if

01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599
emerging uh theme templates. And so if

01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:12.709
emerging uh theme templates. And so if there is your theme has a parent theme

01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719
there is your theme has a parent theme

01:55:12.719 --> 01:55:16.070
there is your theme has a parent theme then uh it also uh introduces additional

01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080
then uh it also uh introduces additional

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.510
then uh it also uh introduces additional logic to pick up uh parent theme uh

01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520
logic to pick up uh parent theme uh

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.270
logic to pick up uh parent theme uh templates and combine them. uh under the

01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280
templates and combine them. uh under the

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:26.390
templates and combine them. uh under the team you are using right now.

01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400
team you are using right now.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.669
team you are using right now. Yeah, just as a reference uh it will be

01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679
Yeah, just as a reference uh it will be

01:55:29.679 --> 01:55:34.709
Yeah, just as a reference uh it will be here in slides.

01:55:34.719 --> 01:55:38.149
Okay. Uh remember that having some

01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159
Okay. Uh remember that having some

01:55:38.159 --> 01:55:39.910
Okay. Uh remember that having some website we could have having some

01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920
website we could have having some

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.070
website we could have having some localization we can have um yeah we were

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080
localization we can have um yeah we were

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.070
localization we can have um yeah we were um able to set up right to left um

01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080
um able to set up right to left um

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.510
um able to set up right to left um support. Uh on the other hand side ref

01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520
support. Uh on the other hand side ref

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.109
support. Uh on the other hand side ref to light support is could be enabled per

01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119
to light support is could be enabled per

01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:59.510
to light support is could be enabled per the theme and uh how it is enabled it is

01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520
the theme and uh how it is enabled it is

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.790
the theme and uh how it is enabled it is enabled using R to left RTL uh support

01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800
enabled using R to left RTL uh support

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.390
enabled using R to left RTL uh support uh

01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400
uh

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.270
uh simply R2L one second

01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280
simply R2L one second

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.030
simply R2L one second uh yeah RTL support uh this settings. So

01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040
uh yeah RTL support uh this settings. So

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.589
uh yeah RTL support uh this settings. So within a default theme uh this setting

01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599
within a default theme uh this setting

01:56:15.599 --> 01:56:20.709
within a default theme uh this setting is enabled. Once it is uh enabled

01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719
is enabled. Once it is uh enabled

01:56:20.719 --> 01:56:24.149
is enabled. Once it is uh enabled it, uh gives the ability to pick up u

01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159
it, uh gives the ability to pick up u

01:56:24.159 --> 01:56:28.950
it, uh gives the ability to pick up u additional styles uh with the RL this

01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960
additional styles uh with the RL this

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.470

01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679
right to left mode is enabled, you may

01:57:15.679 --> 01:57:18.310
right to left mode is enabled, you may refer to this uh specific

01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320
refer to this uh specific

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:22.470
refer to this uh specific is RL mode enabled uh context variable

01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480
is RL mode enabled uh context variable

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:26.550
is RL mode enabled uh context variable context. So this is um

01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560
context. So this is um

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:32.790
context. So this is um so each u u whenever like theme is uh uh

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800
so each u u whenever like theme is uh uh

theme um layout blocks are uh prepared um there is a

01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560
blocks are uh prepared um there is a

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.550
blocks are uh prepared um there is a special

01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560
special

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:46.310
special service which uh collects uh the context

01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320
service which uh collects uh the context

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.990
service which uh collects uh the context uh application context and this

01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000
uh application context and this

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.030
uh application context and this application context might contain uh

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040
application context might contain uh

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.109
application context might contain uh actually contains um different u

01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119
actually contains um different u

01:57:55.119 --> 01:57:56.629
actually contains um different u uh

01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639
uh

01:57:56.639 --> 01:57:58.790
uh settings which are exposed and then to

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800
settings which are exposed and then to

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.790
settings which are exposed and then to be used uh for the for managing how

01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800
be used uh for the for managing how

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.030
be used uh for the for managing how theme should look like and one of them

01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040
theme should look like and one of them

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.629
theme should look like and one of them is this uh right to left uh mode enabled

01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639
is this uh right to left uh mode enabled

01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:11.589
is this uh right to left uh mode enabled and this is how it could be checked in a

01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599
and this is how it could be checked in a

01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:15.910
and this is how it could be checked in a in a layouts. Uh so

01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920
in a layouts. Uh so

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:19.350
in a layouts. Uh so this context u

01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360
this context u

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:22.310
this context u model um it contains this uh actually

01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320
model um it contains this uh actually

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:25.750
model um it contains this uh actually this is an array uh contains this um the

01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760
this is an array uh contains this um the

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.669
this is an array uh contains this um the value for the for the enabled mode and

01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679
value for the for the enabled mode and

01:58:27.679 --> 01:58:29.830
value for the for the enabled mode and you can simply use it. In this certain

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840
you can simply use it. In this certain

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.270
you can simply use it. In this certain case, we simply depending on the enabled

01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280
case, we simply depending on the enabled

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.669
case, we simply depending on the enabled or enabled mode adding uh or specifying

01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679
or enabled mode adding uh or specifying

01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:42.310
or enabled mode adding uh or specifying uh the value for the the de uh uh

01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320
uh the value for the the de uh uh

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:46.470
uh the value for the the de uh uh option. We will check uh in layouts what

01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480
option. We will check uh in layouts what

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:50.950
option. We will check uh in layouts what it means. But just uh for now keep in

01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960
it means. But just uh for now keep in

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:53.270
it means. But just uh for now keep in mind that uh whenever this mode is

01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280
mind that uh whenever this mode is

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:56.470
mind that uh whenever this mode is enabled then in the layouts we have this

01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480
enabled then in the layouts we have this

01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.430
enabled then in the layouts we have this specific context which could be checked

01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440
specific context which could be checked

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:04.629
specific context which could be checked and uh in a twe uh templates u there is

01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639
and uh in a twe uh templates u there is

01:59:04.639 --> 01:59:08.229
and uh in a twe uh templates u there is a special tweak function uh or is RTL

01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239
a special tweak function uh or is RTL

01:59:08.239 --> 01:59:10.550
a special tweak function uh or is RTL mode which you can use in in a tweak

01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560
mode which you can use in in a tweak

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:13.830
mode which you can use in in a tweak templates for checking

01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840
templates for checking

01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:16.390
templates for checking and uh yeah I mentioned it before we

01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400
and uh yeah I mentioned it before we

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:21.350
and uh yeah I mentioned it before we have this um uh support it is enabled

01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360
have this um uh support it is enabled

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:24.229
have this um uh support it is enabled per uh localization.

01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239
per uh localization.

01:59:24.239 --> 01:59:27.589
per uh localization. One second. I will

01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599
One second. I will

01:59:27.599 --> 01:59:30.840
One second. I will uh So we have uh localization

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:30.850
uh So we have uh localization

01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:36.149
uh So we have uh localization [Music]

01:59:36.159 --> 01:59:38.310
and depending on selected localization

01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320
and depending on selected localization

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.149
and depending on selected localization for the

01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159
for the

01:59:40.159 --> 01:59:45.189
for the uh for the website uh it will

01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199
uh for the website uh it will

01:59:45.199 --> 01:59:50.709
uh for the website uh it will uh okay it will define whether

localizations create localization.

01:59:58.719 --> 02:00:02.149
This option is responsible for that for

02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159
This option is responsible for that for

is like additional option is to

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:46.629
is like additional option is to uh is to use uh an extension um uh we

02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639
uh is to use uh an extension um uh we

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.910
uh is to use uh an extension um uh we have uh publicly available called u uh

02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920
have uh publicly available called u uh

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:57.430
have uh publicly available called u uh default theme configuration extension.

02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:00.470
Okay, this is the the extension. What it

Okay, this is the the extension. What it

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.870
Okay, this is the the extension. What it gives? It gives the ability uh to uh

02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880
gives? It gives the ability uh to uh

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.189
gives? It gives the ability uh to uh define uh so it gives the ability

02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199
define uh so it gives the ability

02:01:09.199 --> 02:01:11.510
define uh so it gives the ability gives additional configuration by which

02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520
gives additional configuration by which

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.750
gives additional configuration by which you can uh change uh the theme uh the

02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760
you can uh change uh the theme uh the

02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.350
you can uh change uh the theme uh the default theme uh of the application. So

02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360
default theme uh of the application. So

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.390
default theme uh of the application. So here are the examples like changing the

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400
here are the examples like changing the

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.350
here are the examples like changing the the colors, the fonts, uh the position u

02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360
the colors, the fonts, uh the position u

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:31.189
the colors, the fonts, uh the position u and we have like u description of the

02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199
and we have like u description of the

02:01:31.199 --> 02:01:34.229
and we have like u description of the just as an example of kind of uh options

02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239
just as an example of kind of uh options

02:01:34.239 --> 02:01:36.790
just as an example of kind of uh options could be changed for the header, footer,

02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800
could be changed for the header, footer,

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.109
could be changed for the header, footer, u some secondary color. So you are

02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119
u some secondary color. So you are

02:01:39.119 --> 02:01:43.510
u some secondary color. So you are specifying all that stuff and um uh

02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520
specifying all that stuff and um uh

02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.310
specifying all that stuff and um uh presenting uh a different uh uh

02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320
presenting uh a different uh uh

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.950
presenting uh a different uh uh uh theme. Uh it will be used the default

02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960
uh theme. Uh it will be used the default

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.830
uh theme. Uh it will be used the default theme but actually it will be styled and

02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840
theme but actually it will be styled and

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.790
theme but actually it will be styled and colored differently and some clients uh

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800
colored differently and some clients uh

02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:00.870
colored differently and some clients uh are using uh

02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880
are using uh

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:03.830
are using uh uh some clients are using this uh uh

02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840
uh some clients are using this uh uh

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.790
uh some clients are using this uh uh this extension uh so much and we have

02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800
this extension uh so much and we have

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.589
this extension uh so much and we have like uh some source code which is

02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599
like uh some source code which is

02:02:09.599 --> 02:02:12.550
like uh some source code which is available here. So it was developed by

02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560
available here. So it was developed by

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:16.149
available here. So it was developed by uh one of our uh developers and quite

02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159
uh one of our uh developers and quite

02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:19.990
uh one of our uh developers and quite rich documentation uh what could be uh

02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000
rich documentation uh what could be uh

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.550
rich documentation uh what could be uh configured uh using this uh

02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560
configured uh using this uh

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.870
configured uh using this uh uh this extension

02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880
uh this extension

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:29.109
uh this extension plenty of options.

02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119
plenty of options.

02:02:29.119 --> 02:02:32.390
plenty of options. So on top of existing default themes, it

02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400
So on top of existing default themes, it

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.790
So on top of existing default themes, it simply brings uh additional

02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800
simply brings uh additional

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.390
simply brings uh additional customizations specifically related to

02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400
customizations specifically related to

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.669
customizations specifically related to changing styles, colors uh uh of the of

02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679
changing styles, colors uh uh of the of

02:02:43.679 --> 02:02:46.550
changing styles, colors uh uh of the of the website.

02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560
the website.

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.109
the website. Okay. So we have a theme uh but under

02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119
Okay. So we have a theme uh but under

02:02:49.119 --> 02:02:51.990
Okay. So we have a theme uh but under the hood u the theme itself it should

02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000
the hood u the theme itself it should

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.189
the hood u the theme itself it should have some layout and actually layout is

02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199
have some layout and actually layout is

02:02:55.199 --> 02:02:57.910
have some layout and actually layout is built of the layout itself and the

02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920
built of the layout itself and the

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.910
built of the layout itself and the blocks it contains of uh and layouts

02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920
blocks it contains of uh and layouts

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:05.109
blocks it contains of uh and layouts this is a view layer of the MBC model

02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119
this is a view layer of the MBC model

02:03:05.119 --> 02:03:08.390
this is a view layer of the MBC model view controller this pattern uh layout

02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400
view controller this pattern uh layout

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.709
view controller this pattern uh layout contains of the uh structured blocks

02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719
contains of the uh structured blocks

02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:16.709
contains of the uh structured blocks uh let's check this link uh what it says

02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719
uh let's check this link uh what it says

02:03:16.719 --> 02:03:19.109
uh let's check this link uh what it says has

02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119
has

02:03:19.119 --> 02:03:21.750
has uh so we have a u remember we were

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760
uh so we have a u remember we were

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.270
uh so we have a u remember we were talking about default theme here we have

02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280
talking about default theme here we have

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:30.950
talking about default theme here we have um and by the way you can uh specify um

02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960
um and by the way you can uh specify um

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.589
um and by the way you can uh specify um theme uh updates uh in different bundles

02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599
theme uh updates uh in different bundles

02:03:35.599 --> 02:03:38.950
theme uh updates uh in different bundles you would like. So the common uh

02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960
you would like. So the common uh

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.790
you would like. So the common uh recommendation is to introduce u u some

02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800
recommendation is to introduce u u some

02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.030
recommendation is to introduce u u some front end bundle or theme bundle and put

02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040
front end bundle or theme bundle and put

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.669
front end bundle or theme bundle and put all your changes there while in this

02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679
all your changes there while in this

02:03:47.679 --> 02:03:51.430
all your changes there while in this certain case uh so some UI bundle as an

02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440
certain case uh so some UI bundle as an

02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.550
certain case uh so some UI bundle as an example in it introduces uh the changes

02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560
example in it introduces uh the changes

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:56.470
example in it introduces uh the changes for the default theme and they are

02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480
for the default theme and they are

02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.430
for the default theme and they are listed under resources view layout uh

02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440
listed under resources view layout uh

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.470
listed under resources view layout uh path. So following this pattern you will

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480
path. So following this pattern you will

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.310
path. So following this pattern you will have the changes for the default theme.

02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320
have the changes for the default theme.

02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.070
have the changes for the default theme. Yeah. And uh so we have u a page folder

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080
Yeah. And uh so we have u a page folder

02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.470
Yeah. And uh so we have u a page folder which means that uh these changes will

02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480
which means that uh these changes will

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:14.950
which means that uh these changes will be applied to all the pages of the

02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960
be applied to all the pages of the

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.790
be applied to all the pages of the default theme. And uh we have a layout

02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800
default theme. And uh we have a layout

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.950
default theme. And uh we have a layout YAML uh file and layout fi YAML file is

02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960
YAML uh file and layout fi YAML file is

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.070
YAML uh file and layout fi YAML file is actually responsible for uh defining

02:04:26.070 --> 02:04:26.080
actually responsible for uh defining

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:29.669
actually responsible for uh defining layouts uh layout of your theme. So this

02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679
layouts uh layout of your theme. So this

02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:33.189
layouts uh layout of your theme. So this uh particular uh and actually you can uh

02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199
uh particular uh and actually you can uh

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.669
uh particular uh and actually you can uh use any name in name here not only

02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679
use any name in name here not only

02:04:35.679 --> 02:04:40.629
use any name in name here not only layout but just uh uh header footer uh

02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639
layout but just uh uh header footer uh

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:43.270
layout but just uh uh header footer uh it doesn't actually matter the name uh

02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280
it doesn't actually matter the name uh

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.430
it doesn't actually matter the name uh the key point is to put under the

02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440
the key point is to put under the

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.990
the key point is to put under the correct folder. So putting under page

02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000
correct folder. So putting under page

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.189
correct folder. So putting under page folder it means that this uh YAML file

02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199
folder it means that this uh YAML file

02:04:51.199 --> 02:04:54.709
folder it means that this uh YAML file uh will be applied for the all pages of

02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719
uh will be applied for the all pages of

02:04:54.719 --> 02:04:58.629
uh will be applied for the all pages of the default theme. And here it lists

02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639
the default theme. And here it lists

02:04:58.639 --> 02:05:00.709
the default theme. And here it lists what kind of

02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719
what kind of

02:05:00.719 --> 02:05:03.430
what kind of uh it lists actually uh some uh

02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440
uh it lists actually uh some uh

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:05.669
uh it lists actually uh some uh operations which are some actions which

02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679
operations which are some actions which

02:05:05.679 --> 02:05:10.870
operations which are some actions which are performed uh over the uh

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880
are performed uh over the uh

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:13.830
are performed uh over the uh the the over the layout. Uh it

02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840
the the over the layout. Uh it

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:18.229
the the over the layout. Uh it introduces a tree uh with some uh root

02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239
introduces a tree uh with some uh root

02:05:18.239 --> 02:05:21.750
introduces a tree uh with some uh root node with some uh head which under the

02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760
node with some uh head which under the

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:26.229
node with some uh head which under the hood contain title uh matter um blocks

02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239
hood contain title uh matter um blocks

02:05:26.239 --> 02:05:29.510
hood contain title uh matter um blocks the body with some wrapper uh and other

02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520
the body with some wrapper uh and other

02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.030
the body with some wrapper uh and other content uh like that. So think about

02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040
content uh like that. So think about

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.790
content uh like that. So think about layout is uh about is that this is a

02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800
layout is uh about is that this is a

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.310
layout is uh about is that this is a some structure of some of some blocks

02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320
some structure of some of some blocks

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.229
some structure of some of some blocks and actually these blocks might be of

02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239
and actually these blocks might be of

02:05:42.239 --> 02:05:45.189
and actually these blocks might be of different types. Um here you see that uh

02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199
different types. Um here you see that uh

02:05:45.199 --> 02:05:48.550
different types. Um here you see that uh page sidebar this is of block time

02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560
page sidebar this is of block time

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:52.229
page sidebar this is of block time container simply a container. Uh while

02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239
container simply a container. Uh while

02:05:52.239 --> 02:05:57.270
container simply a container. Uh while uh this JS modules uh this is a block of

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280
uh this JS modules uh this is a block of

02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:01.830
uh this JS modules uh this is a block of uh another type JS models config uh

02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840
uh another type JS models config uh

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.709
uh another type JS models config uh while body is of another. So you may

02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719
while body is of another. So you may

02:06:04.719 --> 02:06:07.270
while body is of another. So you may have like pl

02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280
have like pl

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:10.790
have like pl so there are like out of the box some um

02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800
so there are like out of the box some um

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:13.109
so there are like out of the box some um block types u which could be used in

02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119
block types u which could be used in

02:06:13.119 --> 02:06:17.589
block types u which could be used in your layout uh containers uh uh blocks

02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599
your layout uh containers uh uh blocks

02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:21.750
your layout uh containers uh uh blocks some specific u u block types while you

02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760
some specific u u block types while you

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:26.070
some specific u u block types while you can introduce u your own if um those out

02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:26.080
can introduce u your own if um those out

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:27.830
can introduce u your own if um those out of the of the box are not working for

02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840
of the of the box are not working for

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.390
of the of the box are not working for you you can introduce your own uh block

02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400
you you can introduce your own uh block

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.750
you you can introduce your own uh block types uh as well and we have an examples

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760
types uh as well and we have an examples

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:36.149
types uh as well and we have an examples uh for that uh in documentation how to

02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159
uh for that uh in documentation how to

02:06:36.159 --> 02:06:38.229
uh for that uh in documentation how to do that.

02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239
do that.

02:06:38.239 --> 02:06:41.910
do that. Uh okay and uh so we have the structure

02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920
Uh okay and uh so we have the structure

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.149
Uh okay and uh so we have the structure and

02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159
and

02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:47.589
and uh then u we have uh as I mentioned some

02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599
uh then u we have uh as I mentioned some

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:50.550
uh then u we have uh as I mentioned some actions that could be performed. Um here

02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560
actions that could be performed. Um here

02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:55.589
actions that could be performed. Um here we are adding a tree uh of um of blocks

02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599
we are adding a tree uh of um of blocks

02:06:55.599 --> 02:06:59.669
we are adding a tree uh of um of blocks uh the definition of items um how those

02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679
uh the definition of items um how those

02:06:59.679 --> 02:07:03.270
uh the definition of items um how those items uh uh should look like how head

02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280
items uh uh should look like how head

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.430
items uh uh should look like how head should look like what kind of options it

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440
should look like what kind of options it

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.390
should look like what kind of options it could have um the title which are

02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400
could have um the title which are

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:11.589
could have um the title which are provided from some providers and uh the

02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599
provided from some providers and uh the

02:07:11.599 --> 02:07:15.189
provided from some providers and uh the action which actually uh so we have a

02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199
action which actually uh so we have a

02:07:15.199 --> 02:07:18.629
action which actually uh so we have a tree with items and they are added by

02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639
tree with items and they are added by

02:07:18.639 --> 02:07:21.430
tree with items and they are added by add tree action. So we are adding the

02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440
add tree action. So we are adding the

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:23.750
add tree action. So we are adding the whole tree. Another example we can

02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760
whole tree. Another example we can

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:26.870
whole tree. Another example we can simply let's go

02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880
simply let's go

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:31.350
simply let's go to one of the

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:34.149
uh let's pick up some of the other uh

02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159
uh let's pick up some of the other uh

02:07:34.159 --> 02:07:36.069
uh let's pick up some of the other uh another action that could be performed.

02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079
another action that could be performed.

02:07:36.079 --> 02:07:39.830
another action that could be performed. We can set some options. Uh this is

02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840
We can set some options. Uh this is

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.589
We can set some options. Uh this is using set option uh action. So for for

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599
using set option uh action. So for for

02:07:43.599 --> 02:07:47.510
using set option uh action. So for for instance for the mobile uh for the

02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520
instance for the mobile uh for the

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.270
instance for the mobile uh for the mobile layout we are uh changing um the

02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280
mobile layout we are uh changing um the

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:55.030
mobile layout we are uh changing um the content uh value for the uh meta

02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040
content uh value for the uh meta

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:59.990
content uh value for the uh meta viewport um block uh and we are changing

02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000
viewport um block uh and we are changing

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.550
viewport um block uh and we are changing the its value with the this uh width

02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560
the its value with the this uh width

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.069
the its value with the this uh width device

02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079
device

02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:10.229
device width settings and especially yeah um to

02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239
width settings and especially yeah um to

02:08:10.239 --> 02:08:13.109
width settings and especially yeah um to define that this is uh This uh layout

02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119
define that this is uh This uh layout

02:08:13.119 --> 02:08:15.189
define that this is uh This uh layout updates they should be used specifically

02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199
updates they should be used specifically

02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:19.270
updates they should be used specifically for the uh mobile and other context is u

02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280
for the uh mobile and other context is u

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:22.629
for the uh mobile and other context is u global uh publicly available uh context

02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639
global uh publicly available uh context

02:08:22.639 --> 02:08:24.629
global uh publicly available uh context uh is mobile is used for that purpose.

02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639
uh is mobile is used for that purpose.

02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:27.109
uh is mobile is used for that purpose. So in this way we can check either we

02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119
So in this way we can check either we

02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:30.550
So in this way we can check either we user is using mobile then uh change uh

02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:30.560
user is using mobile then uh change uh

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:34.950
user is using mobile then uh change uh set u this value uh and provide another

02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960
set u this value uh and provide another

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:38.550
set u this value uh and provide another one override the the default one. So we

02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560
one override the the default one. So we

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:42.470
one override the the default one. So we can set options. We can uh actually I

02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480
can set options. We can uh actually I

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.270
can set options. We can uh actually I guess it should be listed here.

02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280
guess it should be listed here.

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.669
guess it should be listed here. What kind of options do we have? Yeah.

02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679
What kind of options do we have? Yeah.

02:08:47.679 --> 02:08:50.149
What kind of options do we have? Yeah. Uh what kind of actions? We could add

02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159
Uh what kind of actions? We could add

02:08:50.159 --> 02:08:52.470
Uh what kind of actions? We could add some blocks. U so imagine we have a

02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480
some blocks. U so imagine we have a

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.950
some blocks. U so imagine we have a default theme with some layout but we

02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960
default theme with some layout but we

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.109
default theme with some layout but we would like to introduce uh additional uh

02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119
would like to introduce uh additional uh

02:08:59.119 --> 02:09:03.189
would like to introduce uh additional uh block to this default theme using add

02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199
block to this default theme using add

02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:05.350
block to this default theme using add and specifying uh what kind of block you

02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360
and specifying uh what kind of block you

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.870
and specifying uh what kind of block you would like to introduce. You will add

02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880
would like to introduce. You will add

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.270
would like to introduce. You will add additional block. Add tree will hold

02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280
additional block. Add tree will hold

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.910
additional block. Add tree will hold will add the whole tree like several uh

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920
will add the whole tree like several uh

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:15.189
will add the whole tree like several uh items with some hierarchy will be added.

02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199
items with some hierarchy will be added.

02:09:15.199 --> 02:09:18.470
items with some hierarchy will be added. Removing items moving uh item from

02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480
Removing items moving uh item from

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:21.990
Removing items moving uh item from moving block from one place to another

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000
moving block from one place to another

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.229
moving block from one place to another and so on. Changing the the options,

02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239
and so on. Changing the the options,

02:09:24.239 --> 02:09:28.550
and so on. Changing the the options, replacing and so on. Plenty of them.

02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560
replacing and so on. Plenty of them.

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:33.510
replacing and so on. Plenty of them. Uh we have uh possible uh block types

02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520
Uh we have uh possible uh block types

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.790
Uh we have uh possible uh block types that I mentioned. So uh here is a bunch

02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800
that I mentioned. So uh here is a bunch

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:38.709
that I mentioned. So uh here is a bunch of them. For the button you might have

02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719
of them. For the button you might have

02:09:38.719 --> 02:09:42.470
of them. For the button you might have like button uh type uh of the layout you

02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480
like button uh type uh of the layout you

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.750
like button uh type uh of the layout you will be using for the links uh but the

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760
will be using for the links uh but the

02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:49.910
will be using for the links uh but the main the the the mostly used is uh uh

02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920
main the the the mostly used is uh uh

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:59.350
main the the the mostly used is uh uh block types uh containers and blocks.

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:04.790
And uh finally uh like thinking about uh

02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800
And uh finally uh like thinking about uh

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:07.430
And uh finally uh like thinking about uh uh layouts you will have or you should

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440
uh layouts you will have or you should

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.990
uh layouts you will have or you should have uh this kind of structure. And this

02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000
have uh this kind of structure. And this

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.470
have uh this kind of structure. And this is a simple example. Uh with then uh

02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480
is a simple example. Uh with then uh

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:17.109
is a simple example. Uh with then uh some theme that you have for instance

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119
some theme that you have for instance

02:10:17.119 --> 02:10:19.270
some theme that you have for instance the default theme you will have the

02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280
the default theme you will have the

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.990
the default theme you will have the structure of your theme uh of your

02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000
structure of your theme uh of your

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.750
structure of your theme uh of your layout

02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760
layout

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.589
layout containing some uh main some root block

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599
containing some uh main some root block

02:10:27.599 --> 02:10:29.830
containing some uh main some root block which under the hood contains like three

02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840
which under the hood contains like three

02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:33.910
which under the hood contains like three blocks header footer and this uh main uh

02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920
blocks header footer and this uh main uh

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:36.470
blocks header footer and this uh main uh area some body for instance while body

02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480
area some body for instance while body

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.300
area some body for instance while body contains sidebar and main content.

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:41.310
contains sidebar and main content.

02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:43.910
contains sidebar and main content. [Music]

02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920
[Music]

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.629
[Music] Okay.

02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639
Okay.

02:10:46.639 --> 02:10:49.830
Okay. Yeah. And each block it renders u some

02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840
Yeah. And each block it renders u some

02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:55.270
Yeah. And each block it renders u some piece of u HTML uh in the in the layout

02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280
piece of u HTML uh in the in the layout

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.870
piece of u HTML uh in the in the layout structure.

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.550
Uh

02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560
Uh

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.310
Uh okay this is the example I went through

02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320
okay this is the example I went through

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.709
okay this is the example I went through the directory structure we also have

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719
the directory structure we also have

02:11:06.719 --> 02:11:10.470
the directory structure we also have checked. So we should have uh this u uh

02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480
checked. So we should have uh this u uh

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:13.990
checked. So we should have uh this u uh so all theme uh configuration uh is

02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000
so all theme uh configuration uh is

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.430
so all theme uh configuration uh is defined under uh this resources view

02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440
defined under uh this resources view

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.350
defined under uh this resources view layouts theme where we have

02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360
layouts theme where we have

02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.629
layouts theme where we have configuration uh for the assets and uh

02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639
configuration uh for the assets and uh

02:11:22.639 --> 02:11:25.669
configuration uh for the assets and uh JavaScript uh components.

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679
JavaScript uh components.

02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:30.950
JavaScript uh components. Um we have the ability to specify

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.069
um the folder with the imports and this

02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079
um the folder with the imports and this

02:11:34.079 --> 02:11:36.310
um the folder with the imports and this is um

02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320
is um

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.069
is um actually the place uh where you uh

02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079
actually the place uh where you uh

02:11:40.079 --> 02:11:43.109
actually the place uh where you uh define uh layout and blocks which you

02:11:43.109 --> 02:11:43.119
define uh layout and blocks which you

02:11:43.119 --> 02:11:45.189
define uh layout and blocks which you would like to reuse. For instance, you

02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199
would like to reuse. For instance, you

02:11:45.199 --> 02:11:48.870
would like to reuse. For instance, you have this u

02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880
have this u

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:52.149
have this u second uh oops

02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159
second uh oops

02:11:52.159 --> 02:11:55.430
second uh oops you have this uh

02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440
you have this uh

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.629
you have this uh uh this block uh oh let's pick up this

02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639
uh this block uh oh let's pick up this

02:11:58.639 --> 02:12:01.750
uh this block uh oh let's pick up this one uh this search for a product. So you

02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760
one uh this search for a product. So you

02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:05.669
one uh this search for a product. So you define uh in one um in the imports

02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679
define uh in one um in the imports

02:12:05.679 --> 02:12:08.550
define uh in one um in the imports folder how this uh block should look

02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560
folder how this uh block should look

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:11.750
folder how this uh block should look like what kind of options it can uh

02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760
like what kind of options it can uh

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:16.310
like what kind of options it can uh receive and then simply uh

02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320
receive and then simply uh

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.510
receive and then simply uh import and reuse uh this block on

02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520
import and reuse uh this block on

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.910
import and reuse uh this block on different uh pages like navigating here

02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920
different uh pages like navigating here

02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.910
different uh pages like navigating here to above. you still have have this uh uh

02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920
to above. you still have have this uh uh

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.310
to above. you still have have this uh uh search for a product uh block u and and

02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320
search for a product uh block u and and

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.870
search for a product uh block u and and other places. So you define an imports

02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880
other places. So you define an imports

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.350
other places. So you define an imports folder and then simply reuse it just not

02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360
folder and then simply reuse it just not

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.790
folder and then simply reuse it just not to copy paste across different u pages

02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800
to copy paste across different u pages

02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:41.589
to copy paste across different u pages but just define once and use in other

02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599
but just define once and use in other

02:12:41.599 --> 02:12:45.189
but just define once and use in other places.

02:12:45.199 --> 02:12:48.229
Okay, let me

02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239
Okay, let me

02:12:48.239 --> 02:12:52.069
Okay, let me uh return back to to the default themes.

02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079
uh return back to to the default themes.

02:12:52.079 --> 02:12:54.790
uh return back to to the default themes. So okay we have configuration the assets

02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800
So okay we have configuration the assets

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:59.350
So okay we have configuration the assets and we have imports where we have u uh

02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360
and we have imports where we have u uh

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.510
and we have imports where we have u uh some common uh commonly used uh blocks

02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520
some common uh commonly used uh blocks

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:05.589
some common uh commonly used uh blocks which are then we use. So here we have

02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599
which are then we use. So here we have

02:13:05.599 --> 02:13:08.790
which are then we use. So here we have defined how data grid should look like

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800
defined how data grid should look like

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:12.470
defined how data grid should look like um in the imports folder and then under

02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480
um in the imports folder and then under

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.589
um in the imports folder and then under different pages we may pick up this u

02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599
different pages we may pick up this u

02:13:15.599 --> 02:13:19.910
different pages we may pick up this u data grid uh layout definition and uh

02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920
data grid uh layout definition and uh

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.550
data grid uh layout definition and uh reuse it for the uh listing orders uh

02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560
reuse it for the uh listing orders uh

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:27.270
reuse it for the uh listing orders uh data grid for listing products data grid

02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280
data grid for listing products data grid

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:30.310
data grid for listing products data grid for listing uh some customer users data

02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320
for listing uh some customer users data

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:33.990
for listing uh some customer users data grid uh yeah but uh in general the

02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000
grid uh yeah but uh in general the

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.350
grid uh yeah but uh in general the definition and the how it should look

02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360
definition and the how it should look

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:39.430
definition and the how it should look like is defined in the imports folder

02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440
like is defined in the imports folder

02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:45.830
like is defined in the imports folder and reuse. Okay, let's switch back. Um

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:49.430
page folder it is related to uh to all

02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440
page folder it is related to uh to all

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.229
page folder it is related to uh to all the pages. So uh the definition that is

02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239
the pages. So uh the definition that is

02:13:52.239 --> 02:13:56.470
the pages. So uh the definition that is listed here icon some JS models uh all

02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480
listed here icon some JS models uh all

02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.629
listed here icon some JS models uh all that stuff will be applied to all pages

02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639
that stuff will be applied to all pages

02:13:58.639 --> 02:14:01.990
that stuff will be applied to all pages of the default theme. But if we if you

02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000
of the default theme. But if we if you

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.109
of the default theme. But if we if you would like to uh specify

02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119
would like to uh specify

02:14:07.119 --> 02:14:11.669
would like to uh specify uh to specify some uh some specific u uh

02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679
uh to specify some uh some specific u uh

02:14:11.679 --> 02:14:15.669
uh to specify some uh some specific u uh layout uh depending on a root uh on the

02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679
layout uh depending on a root uh on the

02:14:15.679 --> 02:14:21.270
layout uh depending on a root uh on the URL uh that is um that user will be

02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280
URL uh that is um that user will be

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:24.629
URL uh that is um that user will be landed to. Uh then we would need to use

02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639
landed to. Uh then we would need to use

02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:27.430
landed to. Uh then we would need to use uh the folder which is named by the root

02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440
uh the folder which is named by the root

02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:31.750
uh the folder which is named by the root name. uh for instance uh uh oro uh

02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760
name. uh for instance uh uh oro uh

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.950
name. uh for instance uh uh oro uh content workflow uh transition form.

02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960
content workflow uh transition form.

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.990
content workflow uh transition form. This is a root name and under this uh

02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000
This is a root name and under this uh

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.149
This is a root name and under this uh while user will be navigating to this

02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159
while user will be navigating to this

02:14:42.159 --> 02:14:47.589
while user will be navigating to this route. Uh the layout should be uh should

02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599
route. Uh the layout should be uh should

02:14:47.599 --> 02:14:49.910
route. Uh the layout should be uh should be changed. And here you may notice that

02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920
be changed. And here you may notice that

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.229
be changed. And here you may notice that we are introducing some additional

02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239
we are introducing some additional

02:14:52.239 --> 02:14:56.790
we are introducing some additional blocks uh some importing some uh reusing

02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800
blocks uh some importing some uh reusing

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:59.510
blocks uh some importing some uh reusing some of the existing blocks and moving

02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520
some of the existing blocks and moving

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.470
some of the existing blocks and moving some blocks from one place to another.

02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480
some blocks from one place to another.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:06.470
some blocks from one place to another. Uh so just to

02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480
Uh so just to

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.310
Uh so just to uh to recap page for all the pages and

02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320
uh to recap page for all the pages and

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:13.750
uh to recap page for all the pages and uh folders which are named by root name

02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760
uh folders which are named by root name

02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:22.310
uh folders which are named by root name they used for specific uh roots only.

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.470
Yeah, for specific roots only. Let's

02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480
Yeah, for specific roots only. Let's

02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.109
Yeah, for specific roots only. Let's pick up an example what we have here.

02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119
pick up an example what we have here.

02:15:27.119 --> 02:15:29.510
pick up an example what we have here. Yeah. And in this example, uh we have a

02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520
Yeah. And in this example, uh we have a

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:33.990
Yeah. And in this example, uh we have a custom theme. Okay. We have uh the page

02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000
custom theme. Okay. We have uh the page

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.310
custom theme. Okay. We have uh the page it will define the changes for all the

02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320
it will define the changes for all the

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.229
it will define the changes for all the pages and for checkout uh when user will

02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239
pages and for checkout uh when user will

02:15:40.239 --> 02:15:43.830
pages and for checkout uh when user will be on a uh or check out front end uh

02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840
be on a uh or check out front end uh

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:46.709
be on a uh or check out front end uh checkout route. Uh then uh for the

02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719
checkout route. Uh then uh for the

02:15:46.719 --> 02:15:51.189
checkout route. Uh then uh for the custom team it will introduce some

02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199
custom team it will introduce some

02:15:51.199 --> 02:15:56.069
custom team it will introduce some different uh uh some other updates uh

02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079
different uh uh some other updates uh

02:15:56.079 --> 02:15:59.350
different uh uh some other updates uh for this particular uh particular route

02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360
for this particular uh particular route

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.109

And demonstrate how the layout structure looks like.

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.150
Okay.

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.910
Now

02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.790
I will pick up

02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:59.990
uh the default website. Um I have

02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000
uh the default website. Um I have

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.509
uh the default website. Um I have enabled uh

02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519
enabled uh

02:17:03.519 --> 02:17:06.549
enabled uh uh dev mode. Within a dev mode we have

02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559
uh dev mode. Within a dev mode we have

02:17:06.559 --> 02:17:09.990
uh dev mode. Within a dev mode we have this uh symfony toolbar available at the

02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000
this uh symfony toolbar available at the

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.549
this uh symfony toolbar available at the bottom. So we could be expanded

02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559
bottom. So we could be expanded

02:17:12.559 --> 02:17:14.469
bottom. So we could be expanded collapsed.

02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479
collapsed.

02:17:14.479 --> 02:17:24.150
collapsed. Okay. And uh let's actually sign in.

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:35.509
Okay. So if I go to the

02:17:35.519 --> 02:17:37.990
to the checkout

02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000
to the checkout

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.950
to the checkout right here you see what kind of uh route

02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960
right here you see what kind of uh route

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.910
right here you see what kind of uh route is used for the uh for the checkout uh

02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920
is used for the uh for the checkout uh

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:46.790
is used for the uh for the checkout uh for this particular page and for it um

02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800
for this particular page and for it um

02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:50.070
for this particular page and for it um so I have navigated here uh we have a

02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080
so I have navigated here uh we have a

02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:53.270
so I have navigated here uh we have a root named called Oro checkout front end

02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280
root named called Oro checkout front end

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:54.389
root named called Oro checkout front end root

02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399
root

02:17:54.399 --> 02:17:56.629
root So whenever we would like to introduce

02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639
So whenever we would like to introduce

02:17:56.639 --> 02:17:59.910
So whenever we would like to introduce changes to the layout of this uh of this

02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920
changes to the layout of this uh of this

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:03.030
changes to the layout of this uh of this page, we would need to copy this root

02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040
page, we would need to copy this root

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:09.509
page, we would need to copy this root name and uh add under our custom theme

02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519
name and uh add under our custom theme

02:18:09.519 --> 02:18:13.750
name and uh add under our custom theme add a folder with the name of the root

02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760
add a folder with the name of the root

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:15.509
add a folder with the name of the root in this case or check out front end

02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519
in this case or check out front end

02:18:15.519 --> 02:18:19.270
in this case or check out front end checkout and introduce uh the changes uh

02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280
checkout and introduce uh the changes uh

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.950
checkout and introduce uh the changes uh to the layout. uh let's see what kind of

02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960
to the layout. uh let's see what kind of

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.589
to the layout. uh let's see what kind of changes uh are

02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599
changes uh are

02:18:25.599 --> 02:18:30.150
changes uh are introduced for instance multiple

02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160
introduced for instance multiple

02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.070
introduced for instance multiple uh multiple shipping methods.

02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080
uh multiple shipping methods.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:37.509
uh multiple shipping methods. Uh so this uh

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519
Uh so this uh

02:18:37.519 --> 02:18:41.830
Uh so this uh change is applied only when we have a

02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840
change is applied only when we have a

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:45.589
change is applied only when we have a workflow step enter shipping method and

02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599
workflow step enter shipping method and

02:18:45.599 --> 02:18:47.669
workflow step enter shipping method and multi shipping enabled. So whenever we

02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679
multi shipping enabled. So whenever we

02:18:47.679 --> 02:18:50.709
multi shipping enabled. So whenever we have uh we are

02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719
have uh we are

02:18:50.719 --> 02:18:54.389
have uh we are uh on this page and workflow

02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399
uh on this page and workflow

02:18:54.399 --> 02:18:56.309
uh on this page and workflow have several steps billing shipping

02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319
have several steps billing shipping

02:18:56.319 --> 02:18:58.150
have several steps billing shipping shipping method. So we should be on a

02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160
shipping method. So we should be on a

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.389
shipping method. So we should be on a shipping uh information step or shipping

02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399
shipping uh information step or shipping

02:19:00.399 --> 02:19:05.190
shipping uh information step or shipping address step. This is this one

02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200
address step. This is this one

02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.110
address step. This is this one this step um

02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120
this step um

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:11.589
this step um if you are on this uh step enter

02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599
if you are on this uh step enter

02:19:11.599 --> 02:19:13.669
if you are on this uh step enter shipping method. Oh actually shipping

02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679
shipping method. Oh actually shipping

02:19:13.679 --> 02:19:17.110
shipping method. Oh actually shipping method this is this one.

02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120
method this is this one.

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.190
method this is this one. So okay whenever we are on this shipping

02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200
So okay whenever we are on this shipping

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.990
So okay whenever we are on this shipping method uh step of the workflow plus we

02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000
method uh step of the workflow plus we

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.389
method uh step of the workflow plus we have uh like multi-shipping enabled.

02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399
have uh like multi-shipping enabled.

02:19:26.399 --> 02:19:28.950
have uh like multi-shipping enabled. This is in configuration then we would

02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960
This is in configuration then we would

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.389
This is in configuration then we would need to append additional option for

02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399
need to append additional option for

02:19:32.399 --> 02:19:37.190
need to append additional option for this uh for this uh block. Uh we have uh

02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200
this uh for this uh block. Uh we have uh

02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:40.790
this uh for this uh block. Uh we have uh uh this layout block just uh grid render

02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800
uh this layout block just uh grid render

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:43.830
uh this layout block just uh grid render parameters and some add some additional

02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840
parameters and some add some additional

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:46.389
parameters and some add some additional JavaScript model

02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399
JavaScript model

02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:48.070
JavaScript model uh

02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080
uh

02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.750
uh and let me demonstrate how

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760
and let me demonstrate how

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:54.630
and let me demonstrate how layout structure looks like. So if I go

02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640
layout structure looks like. So if I go

02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.469
layout structure looks like. So if I go to the

02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479
to the

02:19:56.479 --> 02:19:59.750
to the to the profiler of this toolbar and pick

02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760
to the profiler of this toolbar and pick

02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:02.790
to the profiler of this toolbar and pick up layouts. So for the layouts we have

02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800
up layouts. So for the layouts we have

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:05.110
up layouts. So for the layouts we have additional section and this is actually

02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120
additional section and this is actually

02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:08.389
additional section and this is actually available for the uh storefront uh only.

02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399
available for the uh storefront uh only.

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:11.990
available for the uh storefront uh only. So we have a layouts it responsible for

02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000
So we have a layouts it responsible for

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.150
So we have a layouts it responsible for um

02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160
um

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:16.790
um providing information what how layout is

02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800
providing information what how layout is

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:19.750
providing information what how layout is built of kind of what kind of blocks and

02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760
built of kind of what kind of blocks and

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:22.230
built of kind of what kind of blocks and how they could be customized. Okay we

02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240
how they could be customized. Okay we

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:25.270
how they could be customized. Okay we have a layout it works uh for the root

02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280
have a layout it works uh for the root

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:28.950
have a layout it works uh for the root or check out from 10 root. Okay. So, I

02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960
or check out from 10 root. Okay. So, I

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:32.630
or check out from 10 root. Okay. So, I can expand. Um, by the way, the updates

02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640
can expand. Um, by the way, the updates

02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:35.429
can expand. Um, by the way, the updates for the layout could be added here is

02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439
for the layout could be added here is

02:20:35.439 --> 02:20:42.150
for the layout could be added here is the hint uh either to the uh oro

02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160
the hint uh either to the uh oro

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.990
the hint uh either to the uh oro layouts default or a check out from 10

02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000
layouts default or a check out from 10

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.950
layouts default or a check out from 10 checkout page or to this one. uh or if

02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960
checkout page or to this one. uh or if

02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:51.110
checkout page or to this one. uh or if you would like to have uh to to have

02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120
you would like to have uh to to have

02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:52.790
you would like to have uh to to have these updates available for all the

02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800
these updates available for all the

02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.710
these updates available for all the pages then they would need to be added

02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720
pages then they would need to be added

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:58.150
pages then they would need to be added to the page folder or uh to the uh

02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160
to the page folder or uh to the uh

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:03.590
to the page folder or uh to the uh default uh uh folder of the of the field

02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600
default uh uh folder of the of the field

02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.550
default uh uh folder of the of the field of the default theme. Okay, I have

02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560
of the default theme. Okay, I have

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:10.070
of the default theme. Okay, I have expanded uh and now we may see uh the

02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080
expanded uh and now we may see uh the

02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:13.510
expanded uh and now we may see uh the structure of our layout uh uh layout

02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520
structure of our layout uh uh layout

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:16.389
structure of our layout uh uh layout tree. So it contains of the head which

02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399
tree. So it contains of the head which

02:21:16.399 --> 02:21:18.710
tree. So it contains of the head which under the hood contains title. Remember

02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720
under the hood contains title. Remember

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:21.190
under the hood contains title. Remember we were navigating uh in a default

02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200
we were navigating uh in a default

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:24.710
we were navigating uh in a default theme. We've seen this meta uh meta

02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720
theme. We've seen this meta uh meta

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:26.950
theme. We've seen this meta uh meta viewport

02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960
viewport

02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:28.870
viewport and so on. The body which has some

02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880
and so on. The body which has some

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:33.270
and so on. The body which has some wrapper. We also seen that uh in a

02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280
wrapper. We also seen that uh in a

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:36.150
wrapper. We also seen that uh in a default theme uh which has a page

02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160
default theme uh which has a page

02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:40.630
default theme uh which has a page container and the the whole tree uh of

02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640
container and the the whole tree uh of

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:42.309
container and the the whole tree uh of the

02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319
the

02:21:42.319 --> 02:21:44.950
the uh of the layout. If we pick up one of

02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960
uh of the layout. If we pick up one of

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.670
uh of the layout. If we pick up one of the uh

02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680
the uh

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:52.630
the uh uh one of the blocks which are listed,

02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640
uh one of the blocks which are listed,

02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:54.870
uh one of the blocks which are listed, let's pick up this logo, right? We can

02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880
let's pick up this logo, right? We can

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:59.270
let's pick up this logo, right? We can see the definition uh of the u of the

02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280
see the definition uh of the u of the

02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:03.270
see the definition uh of the u of the block. So we may find uh the template u

02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280
block. So we may find uh the template u

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:05.590
block. So we may find uh the template u by which this block is rendered. This is

02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600
by which this block is rendered. This is

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:09.270
by which this block is rendered. This is a tweak template uh block logo widget.

02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280
a tweak template uh block logo widget.

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:12.230
a tweak template uh block logo widget. Um let's actually

02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240
Um let's actually

02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:16.630
Um let's actually pick up here. I will try to search it

02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640
pick up here. I will try to search it

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:23.030
pick up here. I will try to search it here.

02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.790
Maybe not so good example.

02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800
Maybe not so good example.

02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:30.230
Maybe not so good example. Okay, let me pick up some other

02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240
Okay, let me pick up some other

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:37.190
Okay, let me pick up some other second

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:41.429
bar search.

02:22:41.439 --> 02:22:44.870
Um,

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:48.550
okay.

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.630
Okay. So we have a

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640
Okay. So we have a

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:55.510
Okay. So we have a uh template uh which is responsible for

02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520
uh template uh which is responsible for

02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.950
uh template uh which is responsible for this block and the plate is uh prepared

02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960
this block and the plate is uh prepared

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:03.270
this block and the plate is uh prepared using twe uh template and here is u you

02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280
using twe uh template and here is u you

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.110
using twe uh template and here is u you may find how it looks like. So if we

02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120
may find how it looks like. So if we

02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:07.830
may find how it looks like. So if we would like to override it then we would

02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840
would like to override it then we would

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.550
would like to override it then we would uh refer to the same block name and add

02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560
uh refer to the same block name and add

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:17.349
uh refer to the same block name and add changes u to the overwritten uh block.

02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359
changes u to the overwritten uh block.

02:23:17.359 --> 02:23:19.190
changes u to the overwritten uh block. Um

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200
Um

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:23.750
Um okay let's uh so uh there is an ability

02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760
okay let's uh so uh there is an ability

02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.389
okay let's uh so uh there is an ability within this uh profiler to define the

02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399
within this uh profiler to define the

02:23:26.399 --> 02:23:29.110
within this uh profiler to define the structure uh to check the structure uh

02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120
structure uh to check the structure uh

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:33.190
structure uh to check the structure uh of your layout uh to check uh what kind

02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200
of your layout uh to check uh what kind

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:35.510
of your layout uh to check uh what kind of template is used for the particular

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520
of template is used for the particular

02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.469
of template is used for the particular block. Uh this will give you the ability

02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479
block. Uh this will give you the ability

02:23:38.479 --> 02:23:42.870
block. Uh this will give you the ability to know um the ability yeah to know what

02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880
to know um the ability yeah to know what

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:45.910
to know um the ability yeah to know what by what ID you would like to you can uh

02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920
by what ID you would like to you can uh

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:48.710
by what ID you would like to you can uh override this uh uh this block this

02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720
override this uh uh this block this

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.990
override this uh uh this block this widget and it also uh contains some

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000
widget and it also uh contains some

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.349
widget and it also uh contains some useful information u of the block the

02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359
useful information u of the block the

02:23:55.359 --> 02:23:57.190
useful information u of the block the ID. So for instance, you would like to

02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200
ID. So for instance, you would like to

02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:59.429
ID. So for instance, you would like to introduce new options for this block,

02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439
introduce new options for this block,

02:23:59.439 --> 02:24:01.429
introduce new options for this block, then you will be referring to the ID of

02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439
then you will be referring to the ID of

02:24:01.439 --> 02:24:03.750
then you will be referring to the ID of the block and adding additional options,

02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760
the block and adding additional options,

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:07.030
the block and adding additional options, some unique identifiers. If options u if

02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040
some unique identifiers. If options u if

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.510
some unique identifiers. If options u if we have an options uh uh like here. So

02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520
we have an options uh uh like here. So

02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:14.710
we have an options uh uh like here. So uh items for the top navigation menu, it

02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720
uh items for the top navigation menu, it

02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:18.950
uh items for the top navigation menu, it is provided using data menu uh get menu

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960
is provided using data menu uh get menu

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:30.469
is provided using data menu uh get menu uh uh method. So let's pick up here.

02:24:30.479 --> 02:24:32.950
And actually here is the place where

02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960
And actually here is the place where

02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:37.590
And actually here is the place where this top navigation uh uh block uh was

02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600
this top navigation uh uh block uh was

02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:40.550
this top navigation uh uh block uh was uh was added. So under customer portal

02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560
uh was added. So under customer portal

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:45.030
uh was added. So under customer portal we have this uh default uh theme folder

02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040
we have this uh default uh theme folder

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.750
we have this uh default uh theme folder uh page means it will be applied for the

02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760
uh page means it will be applied for the

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.910
uh page means it will be applied for the uh for all the pages because we would

02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920
uh for all the pages because we would

02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.830
uh for all the pages because we would like to have top navigation to have on

02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840
like to have top navigation to have on

02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:55.270
like to have top navigation to have on all the pages. It contains uh the

02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280
all the pages. It contains uh the

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:59.349
all the pages. It contains uh the definition of this top navigation uh

02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359
definition of this top navigation uh

02:24:59.359 --> 02:25:03.030
definition of this top navigation uh uh block uh and the structure itself and

02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040
uh block uh and the structure itself and

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:06.230
uh block uh and the structure itself and contains uh how items are provided using

02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240
contains uh how items are provided using

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.429
contains uh how items are provided using this provider. And if you go to uh this

02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439
this provider. And if you go to uh this

02:25:09.439 --> 02:25:12.469
this provider. And if you go to uh this top navigation uh HTML tweak file, we

02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479
top navigation uh HTML tweak file, we

02:25:12.479 --> 02:25:15.510
top navigation uh HTML tweak file, we will find the uh templates which are

02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520
will find the uh templates which are

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:18.469
will find the uh templates which are used for these blocks.

02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479
used for these blocks.

02:25:18.479 --> 02:25:21.110
used for these blocks. And here are the templates for temp uh

02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120
And here are the templates for temp uh

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.990
And here are the templates for temp uh top navigation container, top navigation

02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000
top navigation container, top navigation

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.830
top navigation container, top navigation uh and top navigation menu container.

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.830
Okay, we have um

02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840
Okay, we have um

02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:35.990
Okay, we have um theme. Under the theme we are able to

02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000
theme. Under the theme we are able to

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.630
theme. Under the theme we are able to define u

02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640
define u

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:42.070
define u layout structure. We can um for the

02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080
layout structure. We can um for the

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:45.349
layout structure. We can um for the layout we can have different u actions

02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359
layout we can have different u actions

02:25:45.359 --> 02:25:48.070
layout we can have different u actions that could be performed moving blocks uh

02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080
that could be performed moving blocks uh

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.469
that could be performed moving blocks uh removing blocks changing options of the

02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479
removing blocks changing options of the

02:25:50.479 --> 02:25:52.550
removing blocks changing options of the blocks depending on different

02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560
blocks depending on different

02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:55.190
blocks depending on different conditions. For one customer we are just

02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200
conditions. For one customer we are just

02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:57.190
conditions. For one customer we are just for instance we are removing some block

02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200
for instance we are removing some block

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:00.070
for instance we are removing some block for another we are just uh viewing that

02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080
for another we are just uh viewing that

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:05.110
for another we are just uh viewing that uh that block on the uh layout

02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120
uh that block on the uh layout

02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.550
uh that block on the uh layout uh yeah and using proper uh path to put

02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560
uh yeah and using proper uh path to put

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:14.710
uh yeah and using proper uh path to put the files uh to under uh resources view

02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720
the files uh to under uh resources view

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:17.990
the files uh to under uh resources view layout theme.

02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000
layout theme.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.270
layout theme. uh having um

02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280
uh having um

02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:24.070
uh having um a layout uh you have defined for

02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080
a layout uh you have defined for

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:28.469
a layout uh you have defined for particular team uh sometimes uh it might

02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479
particular team uh sometimes uh it might

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:31.830
particular team uh sometimes uh it might be useful. So whenever you have like uh

02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840
be useful. So whenever you have like uh

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:34.870
be useful. So whenever you have like uh content which is not used too often for

02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880
content which is not used too often for

02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:37.270
content which is not used too often for instance navigation you have a

02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280
instance navigation you have a

02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.070
instance navigation you have a navigation menu which is uh quite uh

02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080
navigation menu which is uh quite uh

02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.870
navigation menu which is uh quite uh complex u with uh some

02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880
complex u with uh some

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.070
complex u with uh some plenty of items uh uh of this navigation

02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080
plenty of items uh uh of this navigation

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:51.429
plenty of items uh uh of this navigation menu and u for it uh for the navigation

02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439
menu and u for it uh for the navigation

02:26:51.439 --> 02:26:56.469
menu and u for it uh for the navigation menu uh to be built uh much quicker um

02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479
menu uh to be built uh much quicker um

02:26:56.479 --> 02:26:59.510
menu uh to be built uh much quicker um you do not change it frequently.

02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520
you do not change it frequently.

02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:03.910
you do not change it frequently. um and to be provided for the end user

02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920
um and to be provided for the end user

02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:06.550
um and to be provided for the end user uh more quickly you may introduce

02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560
uh more quickly you may introduce

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:09.270
uh more quickly you may introduce so-called layout cache it will means

02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280
so-called layout cache it will means

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.830
so-called layout cache it will means that the block which is responsible for

02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840
that the block which is responsible for

02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:15.190
that the block which is responsible for the uh top navigation uh let me pick up

02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200
the uh top navigation uh let me pick up

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:18.550
the uh top navigation uh let me pick up here for instance top navigation menu uh

02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560
here for instance top navigation menu uh

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:21.830
here for instance top navigation menu uh you would like to cache it uh for the

02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840
you would like to cache it uh for the

02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:26.150
you would like to cache it uh for the items uh so and actually the block with

02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160
items uh so and actually the block with

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.190
items uh so and actually the block with the with the items

02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200
the with the items

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.590
the with the items It will be cached uh with all the

02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600
It will be cached uh with all the

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:33.990
It will be cached uh with all the structure with all the

02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000
structure with all the

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.590
structure with all the uh items. Yeah, it will be cached and uh

02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600
uh items. Yeah, it will be cached and uh

02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.230
uh items. Yeah, it will be cached and uh whenever user will be navigating between

02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240
whenever user will be navigating between

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.590
whenever user will be navigating between PE pages, it will not uh so the server

02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600
PE pages, it will not uh so the server

02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.230
PE pages, it will not uh so the server will not uh each time uh process the

02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240
will not uh each time uh process the

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.070
will not uh each time uh process the layout structure, build uh fetch items

02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080
layout structure, build uh fetch items

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.389
layout structure, build uh fetch items and based on fetched items build the

02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399
and based on fetched items build the

02:27:54.399 --> 02:27:56.309
and based on fetched items build the navigation menu. But simply it will be

02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319
navigation menu. But simply it will be

02:27:56.319 --> 02:27:59.590
navigation menu. But simply it will be provided the whole um layout will be

02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600
provided the whole um layout will be

02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:01.750
provided the whole um layout will be provided from uh from cache and with

02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760
provided from uh from cache and with

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.110
provided from uh from cache and with that you can save u time for rendering

02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120
that you can save u time for rendering

02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.190
that you can save u time for rendering the page and provide better uh user

02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200
the page and provide better uh user

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:12.150
the page and provide better uh user experience. You can enable it for some

02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160
experience. You can enable it for some

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.270
experience. You can enable it for some specific layout blocks. U for instance

02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280
specific layout blocks. U for instance

02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:18.870
specific layout blocks. U for instance for top navigation menu container only.

02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880
for top navigation menu container only.

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:23.349
for top navigation menu container only. Uh and u you can define it for what

02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359
Uh and u you can define it for what

02:28:23.359 --> 02:28:26.389
Uh and u you can define it for what particular time um this block should be

02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399
particular time um this block should be

02:28:26.399 --> 02:28:29.670
particular time um this block should be cached and uh if there is a change was

02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680
cached and uh if there is a change was

02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:33.429
cached and uh if there is a change was performed. Uh for instance uh

02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439
performed. Uh for instance uh

02:28:33.439 --> 02:28:38.150
performed. Uh for instance uh uh you have added uh some uh

02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160
uh you have added uh some uh

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:41.110
uh you have added uh some uh some items to the uh navigation menu.

02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120
some items to the uh navigation menu.

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:42.950
some items to the uh navigation menu. You would like to invalidate cache for

02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960
You would like to invalidate cache for

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.710
You would like to invalidate cache for the end user to uh provide accurate um

02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720
the end user to uh provide accurate um

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:49.590
the end user to uh provide accurate um and proper results. Yeah. And there is

02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600
and proper results. Yeah. And there is

02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:53.190
and proper results. Yeah. And there is an options how to invalidate u cache.

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200
an options how to invalidate u cache.

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.630
an options how to invalidate u cache. Let's pick up documentation quickly go

02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640
Let's pick up documentation quickly go

02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:58.950
Let's pick up documentation quickly go how it is defined.

02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960
how it is defined.

02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.230
how it is defined. Uh so for that you would need to uh have

02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240
Uh so for that you would need to uh have

02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:05.349
Uh so for that you would need to uh have this uh for the block uh to define uh

02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359
this uh for the block uh to define uh

02:29:05.359 --> 02:29:09.990
this uh for the block uh to define uh either cache u enabled or disabled uh

02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000
either cache u enabled or disabled uh

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.150
either cache u enabled or disabled uh for particular. So if we are talking

02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160
for particular. So if we are talking

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:15.110
for particular. So if we are talking about uh top navigation menu container.

02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120
about uh top navigation menu container.

02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:17.590
about uh top navigation menu container. So you would pick up this ID top

02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600
So you would pick up this ID top

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.309
So you would pick up this ID top navigation menu container and in your

02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319
navigation menu container and in your

02:29:20.319 --> 02:29:24.550
navigation menu container and in your layout definition would need to sorry uh

02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560
layout definition would need to sorry uh

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:29.590
layout definition would need to sorry uh where I was u to define this uh settings

02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600
where I was u to define this uh settings

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.389
where I was u to define this uh settings set option top navigation container

02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399
set option top navigation container

02:29:32.399 --> 02:29:35.510
set option top navigation container option name cache and equal to true.

02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520
option name cache and equal to true.

02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.790
option name cache and equal to true. Whenever you have uh the requirements to

02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800
Whenever you have uh the requirements to

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:42.950
Whenever you have uh the requirements to have this cache valid only for specific

02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960
have this cache valid only for specific

02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:47.110
have this cache valid only for specific amount of time, you can add max h u and

02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120
amount of time, you can add max h u and

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:51.990
amount of time, you can add max h u and the value in uh in seconds.

02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000
the value in uh in seconds.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.950
the value in uh in seconds. Uh then uh imagine you have you are

02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960
Uh then uh imagine you have you are

02:29:54.960 --> 02:30:00.070
Uh then uh imagine you have you are listing a products um in the

02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080
listing a products um in the

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:03.030
listing a products um in the in the data grid and you would like to

to cache this data grid. Uh while uh

02:30:06.399 --> 02:30:08.950
to cache this data grid. Uh while uh caching the data grid uh you would like

02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960
caching the data grid uh you would like

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:13.110
caching the data grid uh you would like to hash cache the data grid but uh uh

02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120
to hash cache the data grid but uh uh

02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.670
to hash cache the data grid but uh uh have it uh vary um depending on the

02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680
have it uh vary um depending on the

02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:20.790
have it uh vary um depending on the product that is uh listed in this data

for this uh for this caching then based

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:46.309
for this uh for this caching then based on this uh uh tax we can refer to the c

02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319
on this uh uh tax we can refer to the c

02:30:46.319 --> 02:30:50.469
on this uh uh tax we can refer to the c pool and invalidate uh invalidate uh the

02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479
pool and invalidate uh invalidate uh the

02:30:50.479 --> 02:30:53.510
pool and invalidate uh invalidate uh the cache layout has for the particular uh

02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520
cache layout has for the particular uh

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.750
cache layout has for the particular uh particular block.

02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760
particular block.

02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:58.309
particular block. Yeah. And other examples how this uh

02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319
Yeah. And other examples how this uh

02:30:58.319 --> 02:31:00.469
Yeah. And other examples how this uh this should work. There are clients

02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479
this should work. There are clients

02:31:00.479 --> 02:31:05.030
this should work. There are clients which are using that and it saves u it

02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040
which are using that and it saves u it

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:06.950
which are using that and it saves u it brings like additional performance and

02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960
brings like additional performance and

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:10.950
brings like additional performance and saves some time uh while uh providing uh

02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:10.960
saves some time uh while uh providing uh

02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:16.070
saves some time uh while uh providing uh storefront uh pages for the end users.

02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080
storefront uh pages for the end users.

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:18.950
storefront uh pages for the end users. Uh so in some cases this is uh relevant

02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960
Uh so in some cases this is uh relevant

02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:21.030
Uh so in some cases this is uh relevant to be used.

02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040
to be used.

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:24.469
to be used. Okay. And some best practices. Uh yeah,

02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479
Okay. And some best practices. Uh yeah,

02:31:24.479 --> 02:31:26.710
Okay. And some best practices. Uh yeah, I mentioned that before that um we

02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720
I mentioned that before that um we

02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:30.309
I mentioned that before that um we recommend to put theme related uh stuff

02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319
recommend to put theme related uh stuff

02:31:30.319 --> 02:31:33.670
recommend to put theme related uh stuff in a separate bundle. Uh usually some

02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680
in a separate bundle. Uh usually some

02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:35.830
in a separate bundle. Uh usually some front- end developer could be working on

02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840
front- end developer could be working on

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:39.990
front- end developer could be working on that. Uh so that is hold in one uh theme

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000
that. Uh so that is hold in one uh theme

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.830
that. Uh so that is hold in one uh theme bundle

02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840
bundle

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:45.270
bundle just for better organizing u the work

02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280
just for better organizing u the work

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:48.389
just for better organizing u the work and yeah if you face with the issues

02:31:48.389 --> 02:31:48.399
and yeah if you face with the issues

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:51.910
and yeah if you face with the issues that some blocks are making are too

02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920
that some blocks are making are too

02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:54.309
that some blocks are making are too complex uh and

02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319
complex uh and

02:31:54.319 --> 02:31:59.110
complex uh and blocking um for the page uh response

02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120
blocking um for the page uh response

02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:01.910
blocking um for the page uh response then you may introduce layout cache and

02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920
then you may introduce layout cache and

02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:06.389
then you may introduce layout cache and have better performance uh for

02:32:06.399 --> 02:32:10.469
Uh okay that's it what I wanted to um

02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479
Uh okay that's it what I wanted to um

02:32:10.479 --> 02:32:14.150
Uh okay that's it what I wanted to um present related to themes and layouts.

02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160
present related to themes and layouts.

02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:17.110
present related to themes and layouts. Just to recap uh briefly, we have a

02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120
Just to recap uh briefly, we have a

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:20.790
Just to recap uh briefly, we have a theme. Theme is a skin. Uh skin could be

02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800
theme. Theme is a skin. Uh skin could be

02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:23.830
theme. Theme is a skin. Uh skin could be assigned uh either globally either on a

02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840
assigned uh either globally either on a

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:27.990
assigned uh either globally either on a website uh configuration having a skin

02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000
website uh configuration having a skin

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.309
website uh configuration having a skin you uh may have uh a different layout uh

02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319
you uh may have uh a different layout uh

02:32:34.319 --> 02:32:37.270
you uh may have uh a different layout uh layout for that scheme. And for managing

02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280
layout for that scheme. And for managing

02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:39.830
layout for that scheme. And for managing layout for the skin. Uh here we have

02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840
layout for the skin. Uh here we have

02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:45.830
layout for the skin. Uh here we have this u layout definition. Uh and um

02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840
this u layout definition. Uh and um

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:47.910
this u layout definition. Uh and um some actions which could be performed on

02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920
some actions which could be performed on

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:50.389
some actions which could be performed on a on a layout and also checking the

02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399
a on a layout and also checking the

02:32:50.399 --> 02:32:54.389
a on a layout and also checking the conditions uh for what uh types of users

02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399
conditions uh for what uh types of users

02:32:54.399 --> 02:32:58.389
conditions uh for what uh types of users for what application behavior to display

02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399
for what application behavior to display

02:32:58.399 --> 02:33:02.070
for what application behavior to display uh or move uh this or that layout

02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080
uh or move uh this or that layout

02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:07.830
uh or move uh this or that layout blocks. Plus uh each layout u might have

02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840
blocks. Plus uh each layout u might have

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:11.670
blocks. Plus uh each layout u might have uh their own styles uh JavaScript u some

02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680
uh their own styles uh JavaScript u some

02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:15.030
uh their own styles uh JavaScript u some behavior and it is also attached on the

02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040
behavior and it is also attached on the

02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:18.389
behavior and it is also attached on the for the themes uh uh for the theme you

02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399
for the themes uh uh for the theme you

02:33:18.399 --> 02:33:20.710
for the themes uh uh for the theme you are introducing.

02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720
are introducing.

02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:23.349
are introducing. Uh now let's switch to questions and

02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359
Uh now let's switch to questions and

02:33:23.359 --> 02:33:26.389
Uh now let's switch to questions and answers and I will check what we have

02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399
answers and I will check what we have

02:33:26.399 --> 02:33:29.429
answers and I will check what we have here.

02:33:29.439 --> 02:33:32.950
Okay, the first question is do you mean

02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960
Okay, the first question is do you mean

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:36.070
Okay, the first question is do you mean we have to import search bar uh part on

not need to copy paste uh uh the same

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:22.070
not need to copy paste uh uh the same grid definition uh but just simply

02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080
grid definition uh but just simply

02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:25.670
grid definition uh but just simply import u in one place and then reuse uh

02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680
import u in one place and then reuse uh

02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:27.670
import u in one place and then reuse uh in others.

02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680
in others.

02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:29.510
in others. Yeah, understood. We can derive the any

02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520
Yeah, understood. We can derive the any

02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:31.349
Yeah, understood. We can derive the any existing layout in other pages just

02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359
existing layout in other pages just

02:38:31.359 --> 02:38:33.750
existing layout in other pages just using the import functionality. You mean

02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760
using the import functionality. You mean

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:34.630
using the import functionality. You mean directly?

02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640
directly?

02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:37.910
directly? Uh sorry, could you repeat? You mean we

02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920
Uh sorry, could you repeat? You mean we

02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:39.830
Uh sorry, could you repeat? You mean we can derive any functionality which is

02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840
can derive any functionality which is

02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:41.510
can derive any functionality which is already to exist like product grid

02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520
already to exist like product grid

02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:43.349
already to exist like product grid functionality rather than copying whole

02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359
functionality rather than copying whole

02:38:43.359 --> 02:38:45.670
functionality rather than copying whole code again into that customer section

02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680
code again into that customer section

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:48.309
code again into that customer section area we can just use that grid.

02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319
area we can just use that grid.

02:38:48.319 --> 02:38:48.710
area we can just use that grid. Yes.

02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720
Yes.

02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.349
Yes. And plug that and as the import that ID

02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359
And plug that and as the import that ID

02:38:51.359 --> 02:38:53.510
And plug that and as the import that ID so it will automatically

02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520
so it will automatically

02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:55.830
so it will automatically derive that. Okay. Understood. Thanks.

02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840
derive that. Okay. Understood. Thanks.

02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:58.950
derive that. Okay. Understood. Thanks. And usually actually this is the u the

02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960
And usually actually this is the u the

02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:01.590
And usually actually this is the u the flow it is used. We have a grid and we

02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600
flow it is used. We have a grid and we

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:04.710
flow it is used. We have a grid and we have it already defined you

02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:04.720
have it already defined you

02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:06.790
have it already defined you it suits to you. So it satisfies your

02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800
it suits to you. So it satisfies your

02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.790
it suits to you. So it satisfies your requirements how yeah how it looks like

02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800
requirements how yeah how it looks like

02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:11.349
requirements how yeah how it looks like and then you can simply reuse this grid

02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359
and then you can simply reuse this grid

02:39:11.359 --> 02:39:15.190
and then you can simply reuse this grid uh on uh introduce your other um grid

02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200
uh on uh introduce your other um grid

02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.750
uh on uh introduce your other um grid you would like but simply for the grid

02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760
you would like but simply for the grid

02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:20.469
you would like but simply for the grid you would like uh just uh you will have

02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479
you would like uh just uh you will have

02:39:20.479 --> 02:39:22.469
you would like uh just uh you will have the template what will be missing for

02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479
the template what will be missing for

02:39:22.479 --> 02:39:25.349
the template what will be missing for the grid is what kind of uh source of

02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359
the grid is what kind of uh source of

02:39:25.359 --> 02:39:29.670
the grid is what kind of uh source of the grid uh to to to be provided. you

02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:29.680
the grid uh to to to be provided. you

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.389
the grid uh to to to be provided. you would need to specify data grid name and

02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399
would need to specify data grid name and

02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:34.309
would need to specify data grid name and data grid name will pick up what kind of

02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319
data grid name will pick up what kind of

02:39:34.319 --> 02:39:37.830
data grid name will pick up what kind of entity u you would like to present uh

02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840
entity u you would like to present uh

02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:39.990
entity u you would like to present uh and that's it. So you have the layout

02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000
and that's it. So you have the layout

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.070
and that's it. So you have the layout structure and you are simply you are

02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080
structure and you are simply you are

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:45.270
structure and you are simply you are reusing it but simply providing the grid

02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280
reusing it but simply providing the grid

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.070
reusing it but simply providing the grid name you would like to render and data

02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080
name you would like to render and data

02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.030
name you would like to render and data goes to the layout and you have the uh

02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040
goes to the layout and you have the uh

02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:59.270
goes to the layout and you have the uh grid uh displayed u on your page.

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:01.830
Got it. Thank

02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840
Got it. Thank

02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:04.790
Got it. Thank the next question. Are blocks cached or

02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800
the next question. Are blocks cached or

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:06.630
the next question. Are blocks cached or not cached by default? By default, they

02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640
not cached by default? By default, they

02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:09.190
not cached by default? By default, they are not cached.

02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200
are not cached.

02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:17.190
are not cached. Uh, yep, that's it.

02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.750
Kind of on the on the caching side.

02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760
Kind of on the on the caching side.

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:22.230
Kind of on the on the caching side. Um,

02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240
Um,

02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:26.230
Um, what is the

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:27.910
out of the box like the stuff that's on

02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920
out of the box like the stuff that's on

02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:29.910
out of the box like the stuff that's on the page by default. So the main

02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920
the page by default. So the main

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:32.469
the page by default. So the main navigation, some of the other sort of

02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479
navigation, some of the other sort of

02:40:32.479 --> 02:40:34.150
navigation, some of the other sort of static components, are those all cached

02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160
static components, are those all cached

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:36.550
static components, are those all cached and invalidated out of the box? We you

02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560
and invalidated out of the box? We you

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.750
and invalidated out of the box? We you don't have to go in and try and

02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760
don't have to go in and try and

02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:39.990
don't have to go in and try and performance optimize the out of the box

02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000
performance optimize the out of the box

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.990
performance optimize the out of the box experience.

02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000
experience.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.670
experience. Yeah. So out of the box they are not

02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680
Yeah. So out of the box they are not

02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:45.830
Yeah. So out of the box they are not cached. So if you would like to cache,

02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840
cached. So if you would like to cache,

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:48.710
cached. So if you would like to cache, you would need to to enable cache for

02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720
you would need to to enable cache for

02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:51.910
you would need to to enable cache for the block you would like to cache uh and

02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920
the block you would like to cache uh and

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:55.429
the block you would like to cache uh and invalidate and like track uh in what

02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439
invalidate and like track uh in what

02:40:55.439 --> 02:40:58.710
invalidate and like track uh in what cases you would like to invalidate uh uh

02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720
cases you would like to invalidate uh uh

02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:01.750
cases you would like to invalidate uh uh the cache for the layout uh layout

02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760
the cache for the layout uh layout

02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:02.469
the cache for the layout uh layout block.

02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479
block.

02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:04.950
block. Okay, so the default theme does zero

02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960
Okay, so the default theme does zero

02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.870
Okay, so the default theme does zero caching out of the box.

02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880
caching out of the box.

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:11.510
caching out of the box. There is no like uh

02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520
There is no like uh

02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:17.590
There is no like uh what kind of caching you uh so

02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:19.429
I was just thinking you were talking

02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439
I was just thinking you were talking

02:41:19.439 --> 02:41:22.230
I was just thinking you were talking about oh if I add a new custom thing you

02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240
about oh if I add a new custom thing you

02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:24.070
about oh if I add a new custom thing you know a new block or whatever I can

02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080
know a new block or whatever I can

02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:25.670
know a new block or whatever I can specify that to cache

02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680
specify that to cache

02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.190
specify that to cache right now I'm looking at a navigation

02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200
right now I'm looking at a navigation

02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.670
right now I'm looking at a navigation bar that comes with Oro out of the box I

02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680
bar that comes with Oro out of the box I

02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:31.590
bar that comes with Oro out of the box I haven't customized anything is that

02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600
haven't customized anything is that

02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:34.790
haven't customized anything is that navigation block cached

02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800
navigation block cached

02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:37.510
navigation block cached right now or is that uncashed until we

02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520
right now or is that uncashed until we

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.790
right now or is that uncashed until we add customization to make it cache.

02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800
add customization to make it cache.

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:44.070
add customization to make it cache. Uh out of the box it is not cached. Uh

02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080
Uh out of the box it is not cached. Uh

02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:46.550
Uh out of the box it is not cached. Uh okay.

02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560
okay.

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:47.750
okay. All right. That's all I want to know. I

02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760
All right. That's all I want to know. I

02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:49.750
All right. That's all I want to know. I just was trying to figure out from a

02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760
just was trying to figure out from a

02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.510
just was trying to figure out from a performance perspective if day one when

02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520
performance perspective if day one when

02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:53.030
performance perspective if day one when we install Aura we have to go through

02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040
we install Aura we have to go through

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.830
we install Aura we have to go through and add a bundle just to optimize it out

02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840
and add a bundle just to optimize it out

02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:57.429
and add a bundle just to optimize it out of the box. And it sounds like we may

02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439
of the box. And it sounds like we may

02:41:57.439 --> 02:41:59.510
of the box. And it sounds like we may have to do that. Mhm. Yeah. I would

02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520
have to do that. Mhm. Yeah. I would

02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:02.469
have to do that. Mhm. Yeah. I would start optimizing if you really face with

02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479
start optimizing if you really face with

02:42:02.479 --> 02:42:05.349
start optimizing if you really face with the uh with the issue that you see that

02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359
the uh with the issue that you see that

02:42:05.359 --> 02:42:09.190
the uh with the issue that you see that u page load stacks uh and uh the reason

02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200
u page load stacks uh and uh the reason

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:12.309
u page load stacks uh and uh the reason for that you have like some complex data

02:42:12.309 --> 02:42:12.319
for that you have like some complex data

02:42:12.319 --> 02:42:16.389
for that you have like some complex data uh it is fetched anytime you are uh like

02:42:16.389 --> 02:42:16.399
uh it is fetched anytime you are uh like

02:42:16.399 --> 02:42:18.389
uh it is fetched anytime you are uh like navigating the website and you would

02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399
navigating the website and you would

02:42:18.399 --> 02:42:21.910
navigating the website and you would like to uh make it optimal just cache

02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920
like to uh make it optimal just cache

02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:24.469
like to uh make it optimal just cache and just bring the the whole layout from

02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479
and just bring the the whole layout from

02:42:24.479 --> 02:42:27.190
and just bring the the whole layout from the cache. That's it. At this moment you

02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200
the cache. That's it. At this moment you

02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.750
the cache. That's it. At this moment you are just uh investigating checking that

02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760
are just uh investigating checking that

02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:31.910
are just uh investigating checking that the reason for that is this navigation

02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920
the reason for that is this navigation

02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:34.550
the reason for that is this navigation menu for instance uh and specifically

02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560
menu for instance uh and specifically

02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:36.389
menu for instance uh and specifically for the navigation menu which is the

02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399
for the navigation menu which is the

02:42:36.399 --> 02:42:38.630
for the navigation menu which is the bottleneck uh you are adding cache for

02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640
bottleneck uh you are adding cache for

02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:41.990
bottleneck uh you are adding cache for this uh for the ID of this uh of this

02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000
this uh for the ID of this uh of this

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.670
this uh for the ID of this uh of this block.

02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680
block.

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:45.429
block. Okay. Yeah. I just was trying to figure

02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439
Okay. Yeah. I just was trying to figure

02:42:45.439 --> 02:42:47.510
Okay. Yeah. I just was trying to figure out sort of the out of the box

02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520
out sort of the out of the box

02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.750
out sort of the out of the box considerations for caching. It sounds

02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760
considerations for caching. It sounds

02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:52.710
considerations for caching. It sounds like you kind of it should be performant

02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720
like you kind of it should be performant

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:55.670
like you kind of it should be performant enough without it is the is the idea.

02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680
enough without it is the is the idea.

02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.389
enough without it is the is the idea. Yes. Mhm. It should be performed. Yeah.

02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399
Yes. Mhm. It should be performed. Yeah.

02:42:58.399 --> 02:43:01.910
Yes. Mhm. It should be performed. Yeah. This um starts to be actual when you

02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920
This um starts to be actual when you

02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.030
This um starts to be actual when you have like some complex data maybe some

02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040
have like some complex data maybe some

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.790
have like some complex data maybe some conditions which rely I don't know on

02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:08.800
conditions which rely I don't know on

02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:10.790
conditions which rely I don't know on some

02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800
some

02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:15.110
some uh complex logic. Um yeah and to avoid

02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120
uh complex logic. Um yeah and to avoid

02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:19.910
uh complex logic. Um yeah and to avoid this uh you simply have this uh uh data

02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920
this uh you simply have this uh uh data

02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.309
this uh you simply have this uh uh data just cached and provided. No interaction

02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319
just cached and provided. No interaction

02:43:22.319 --> 02:43:24.870
just cached and provided. No interaction with the database, no complex

02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880
with the database, no complex

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:28.230
with the database, no complex computations, just provided the the

02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240
computations, just provided the the

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.389
computations, just provided the the layout with the uh with the templates

02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399
layout with the uh with the templates

to show to scroll what is the for each

02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.469
to show to scroll what is the for each individual slide we adding slides uh

02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479
individual slide we adding slides uh

02:49:26.479 --> 02:49:29.349
individual slide we adding slides uh images uh for those slides this is for

02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359
images uh for those slides this is for

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:31.670
images uh for those slides this is for slide number one with some description

like yeah five types of uh this content widgets. But uh there is quite rich

02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160
widgets. But uh there is quite rich

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:16.950
widgets. But uh there is quite rich documentation how you can uh add new

02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960
documentation how you can uh add new

02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:18.150
documentation how you can uh add new content widget. You would need to

02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160
content widget. You would need to

02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:21.110
content widget. You would need to introduce some service, tag it properly.

02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120
introduce some service, tag it properly.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.750
introduce some service, tag it properly. U then you will have it listed here and

02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760
U then you will have it listed here and

02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:26.150
U then you will have it listed here and also define the options uh for the

02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160
also define the options uh for the

02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:28.230
also define the options uh for the content widget. Uh like here we have

02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:28.240
content widget. Uh like here we have

02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:31.190
content widget. Uh like here we have selected uh tab content. You have one

02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200
selected uh tab content. You have one

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:35.349
selected uh tab content. You have one options uh product segment and other

options uh product segment and other

02:52:35.359 --> 02:52:37.830
options uh product segment and other options. So you have service responsible

02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:37.840
options. So you have service responsible

02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:39.830
options. So you have service responsible for the widget, you have options and

02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840
for the widget, you have options and

02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:42.150
for the widget, you have options and then you would need to have a template

02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160
then you would need to have a template

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:44.550
then you would need to have a template uh how to render this content widgets

02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560
uh how to render this content widgets

02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:48.550
uh how to render this content widgets and just use that's it.

02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:41.120
Uh let's uh switch back to question and

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:42.790
Uh let's uh switch back to question and answers. We do not have any other

02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800
answers. We do not have any other

02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:45.750
answers. We do not have any other questions related to themes and layouts.

02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760
questions related to themes and layouts.

02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:50.469
questions related to themes and layouts. Uh I would say so just to understand it

02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:50.479
Uh I would say so just to understand it

02:53:50.479 --> 02:53:54.710
Uh I would say so just to understand it uh properly uh I would recommend to

02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720
uh properly uh I would recommend to

02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:57.590
uh properly uh I would recommend to uh to check it uh using codebase. So you

02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600
uh to check it uh using codebase. So you

02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:00.790
uh to check it uh using codebase. So you have a theme you go to this theme you

02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800
have a theme you go to this theme you

02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:03.190
have a theme you go to this theme you add some block remove some block and see

02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200
add some block remove some block and see

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.750
add some block remove some block and see the changes how it works. you add some

02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760
the changes how it works. you add some

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:09.830
the changes how it works. you add some styles without that uh yeah

02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840
styles without that uh yeah

02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:12.630
styles without that uh yeah it will be much easier to understand

02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640
it will be much easier to understand

02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:15.190
it will be much easier to understand using code and performing changes from

02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200
using code and performing changes from

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.429
using code and performing changes from there and seeing the results. Yeah. And

02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439
there and seeing the results. Yeah. And

02:54:17.439 --> 02:54:20.150
there and seeing the results. Yeah. And always keep in mind this this Symfony

02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:20.160
always keep in mind this this Symfony

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:23.510
always keep in mind this this Symfony toolbar u helps a lot to understand the

02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520
toolbar u helps a lot to understand the

02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:27.910
toolbar u helps a lot to understand the structure and um understand um what kind

02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920
structure and um understand um what kind

02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:30.469
structure and um understand um what kind of block you would like you would like

02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479
of block you would like you would like

02:54:30.479 --> 02:54:33.429
of block you would like you would like uh to change where it is located what

02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439
uh to change where it is located what

02:54:33.439 --> 02:54:36.230
uh to change where it is located what kind of options it has.

02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240
kind of options it has.

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:40.550

website to have different skin. Now

02:57:00.319 --> 02:57:03.110
website to have different skin. Now let's uh check it from an angle. who

02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120
let's uh check it from an angle. who

02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:06.070
let's uh check it from an angle. who actually goes to the uh to the website

02:57:06.070 --> 02:57:06.080
actually goes to the uh to the website

02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:09.269
actually goes to the uh to the website and purchases products. What of what

02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279
and purchases products. What of what

02:57:09.279 --> 02:57:13.349
and purchases products. What of what kind of entities uh it contains

02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359
kind of entities uh it contains

02:57:13.359 --> 02:57:16.550
kind of entities uh it contains and it contains of the customer entity

02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560
and it contains of the customer entity

02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:19.510
and it contains of the customer entity which is actually uh a company. Think

02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520
which is actually uh a company. Think

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:22.790
which is actually uh a company. Think about customer as a company uh with

02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800
about customer as a company uh with

02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:25.110
about customer as a company uh with which you are doing business business

02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120
which you are doing business business

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:29.110
which you are doing business business with. uh customers could be uh combined

02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120
with. uh customers could be uh combined

02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:32.150
with. uh customers could be uh combined into groups and this is a customer group

02:57:32.150 --> 02:57:32.160
into groups and this is a customer group

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:34.710
into groups and this is a customer group which is responsible for that for

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720
which is responsible for that for

02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:36.870
which is responsible for that for managing

02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880
managing

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:39.830
managing uh grouping those customers. Uh each

02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840
uh grouping those customers. Uh each

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:43.269
uh grouping those customers. Uh each customer or company uh might have uh

02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279
customer or company uh might have uh

02:57:43.279 --> 02:57:45.990
customer or company uh might have uh users uh which are called customer users

02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000
users uh which are called customer users

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.269
users uh which are called customer users which actually goes to the websites and

02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279
which actually goes to the websites and

02:57:49.279 --> 02:57:51.670
which actually goes to the websites and interacts with the websites. These are

02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680
interacts with the websites. These are

02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:54.150
interacts with the websites. These are registered users which belong to the

02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160
registered users which belong to the

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.590
registered users which belong to the company customer user roles. So each

02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600
company customer user roles. So each

02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:02.790
company customer user roles. So each user may have some role uh and um the

user may have some role uh and um the

02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:05.349
user may have some role uh and um the role has some permissions and this is

02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359
role has some permissions and this is

02:58:05.359 --> 02:58:09.190
role has some permissions and this is how we can limit what is allowed for the

02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200
how we can limit what is allowed for the

02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:12.309
how we can limit what is allowed for the customer user what is not. And another

02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319
customer user what is not. And another

02:58:12.319 --> 02:58:14.550
customer user what is not. And another entity this is a customer visitor which

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560
entity this is a customer visitor which

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:16.150
entity this is a customer visitor which is

02:58:16.150 --> 02:58:16.160
is

02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:19.030
is uh responsible for

02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040
uh responsible for

02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:23.110
uh responsible for tracking u uh user interaction before

02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120
tracking u uh user interaction before

02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:27.190
tracking u uh user interaction before user is uh become becomes a registered

02:58:27.190 --> 02:58:27.200
user is uh become becomes a registered

02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:30.950
user is uh become becomes a registered user. So this is for guest users entity

02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960
user. So this is for guest users entity

02:58:30.960 --> 02:58:34.309
user. So this is for guest users entity and let's go over them one by one and

02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:34.319
and let's go over them one by one and

02:58:34.319 --> 02:58:37.510
and let's go over them one by one and check how it works. So customers they

02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520
check how it works. So customers they

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:39.990
check how it works. So customers they represent a company. You might have one

02:58:39.990 --> 02:58:40.000
represent a company. You might have one

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:43.190
represent a company. You might have one company and actually company or division

02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200
company and actually company or division

02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:45.990
company and actually company or division of the company which buys product using

02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000
of the company which buys product using

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:49.510
of the company which buys product using orcommerce website. Uh you might have uh

02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520
orcommerce website. Uh you might have uh

02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:51.349
orcommerce website. Uh you might have uh this

02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359
this

02:58:51.359 --> 02:58:53.670
this companies whom you are doing business

02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680

they also should be listed here. That's

03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:23.670
they also should be listed here. That's how we aggregate the data uh related to

03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680
how we aggregate the data uh related to

03:05:23.680 --> 03:05:27.429
how we aggregate the data uh related to the to the company. And this is one of

03:05:27.429 --> 03:05:27.439
the to the company. And this is one of

03:05:27.439 --> 03:05:29.670
the to the company. And this is one of the benefits of using uh parent child

03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680
the benefits of using uh parent child

03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:31.750
the benefits of using uh parent child relation rather than introducing

03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760
relation rather than introducing

03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:37.030
relation rather than introducing separate uh company a uh east division

03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040
separate uh company a uh east division

03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:40.309
separate uh company a uh east division without assigning to the company a as a

03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319
without assigning to the company a as a

03:05:40.319 --> 03:05:44.309
without assigning to the company a as a child one price list request for code.

03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319
child one price list request for code.

03:05:44.319 --> 03:05:46.710
child one price list request for code. So you see that entities those which are

03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720
So you see that entities those which are

03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:50.230
So you see that entities those which are related to the purchase process of the

03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240
related to the purchase process of the

03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:54.550
related to the purchase process of the of users they are aggregated under the

03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:54.560
of users they are aggregated under the

03:05:54.560 --> 03:05:56.790
of users they are aggregated under the main customer

03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800
main customer

03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:01.750
main customer orders and and other stuff.

03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760
orders and and other stuff.

03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:06.469
orders and and other stuff. Uh as we were talking about u websites

03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479
Uh as we were talking about u websites

03:06:06.479 --> 03:06:09.349
Uh as we were talking about u websites website can have their own configuration

03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359
website can have their own configuration

03:06:09.359 --> 03:06:12.870
website can have their own configuration same is applicable for the uh customers.

03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880
same is applicable for the uh customers.

03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:15.750
same is applicable for the uh customers. So customer may have its own

03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:15.760
So customer may have its own

03:06:15.760 --> 03:06:17.590
So customer may have its own configuration which overrides the

03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600
configuration which overrides the

03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:20.630
configuration which overrides the website configuration and overrides the

03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640
website configuration and overrides the

03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:22.950
website configuration and overrides the uh global configuration. So if I click

03:06:22.950 --> 03:06:22.960
uh global configuration. So if I click

03:06:22.960 --> 03:06:24.469
uh global configuration. So if I click configuration

03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479
configuration

03:06:24.479 --> 03:06:26.790
configuration uh it opens uh a page with the

03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800
uh it opens uh a page with the

03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:30.550
uh it opens uh a page with the configuration but uh the difference is

03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560
configuration but uh the difference is

03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:33.349
configuration but uh the difference is that number of options is uh not quite

03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359
that number of options is uh not quite

03:06:33.359 --> 03:06:36.230
that number of options is uh not quite big. So just uh changing the main

03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240
big. So just uh changing the main

03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:39.269
big. So just uh changing the main navigation menu for the we we are

03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279
navigation menu for the we we are

03:06:39.279 --> 03:06:41.510
navigation menu for the we we are allowed out of the box I mean for the

03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520
allowed out of the box I mean for the

03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:44.870
allowed out of the box I mean for the company A um so instead of using this

03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880
company A um so instead of using this

03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:46.550
company A um so instead of using this commerce main menu we can introduce

03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560
commerce main menu we can introduce

03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:49.510
commerce main menu we can introduce another menu specific uh relevant for

03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520
another menu specific uh relevant for

03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:53.190
another menu specific uh relevant for this company A and assign it here and we

03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200
this company A and assign it here and we

03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:56.870
this company A and assign it here and we have some uh product uh

03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880

have some uh product uh uh specific either we allow to export

03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200
uh specific either we allow to export

03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:04.309
uh specific either we allow to export grids uh products or Not uh there were

03:07:04.309 --> 03:07:04.319
grids uh products or Not uh there were

03:07:04.319 --> 03:07:08.790
grids uh products or Not uh there were cases which I faced with when for the

03:07:08.790 --> 03:07:08.800
cases which I faced with when for the

03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:11.910
cases which I faced with when for the number of options uh were change were

03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920
number of options uh were change were

03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:14.950
number of options uh were change were extended for the uh for the c uh for the

03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960
extended for the uh for the c uh for the

03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:18.710

customer that are available uh and uh yeah and then used in application u

03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960
yeah and then used in application u

03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:26.230
yeah and then used in application u uh to uh provide some specific behavior

03:07:26.230 --> 03:07:26.240

be enabled for the whole group. uh for those u uh

03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560
those u uh

03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:16.950
those u uh functionality that I was just uh uh

03:10:16.950 --> 03:10:16.960
functionality that I was just uh uh

03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:19.750
functionality that I was just uh uh referring to is meant some payment

03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760
referring to is meant some payment

03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:23.670
referring to is meant some payment settings, some shipping methods, u some

03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680
settings, some shipping methods, u some

03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:26.469
settings, some shipping methods, u some uh tax uh rates which may be common for

03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479
uh tax uh rates which may be common for

03:10:26.479 --> 03:10:30.230
uh tax uh rates which may be common for customer groups. Uh specifically the

03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:30.240
customer groups. Uh specifically the

03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:32.870
customer groups. Uh specifically the most actually use cases is whenever we

03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880
most actually use cases is whenever we

03:10:32.880 --> 03:10:34.710
most actually use cases is whenever we have some prices which should be common

03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720
have some prices which should be common

03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:38.070
have some prices which should be common for the uh for the whole group. Yeah.

03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080
for the uh for the whole group. Yeah.

03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:40.389
for the uh for the whole group. Yeah. And in this case,

03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399
And in this case,

03:10:40.399 --> 03:10:43.510
And in this case, this is good to combine customers into

03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520
this is good to combine customers into

03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:46.150
this is good to combine customers into groups.

03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160
groups.

03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:50.389
groups. Uh let's uh go to

03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399
Uh let's uh go to

03:10:50.399 --> 03:10:54.710
Uh let's uh go to uh customers and um select pick up uh

03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720
uh customers and um select pick up uh

03:10:54.720 --> 03:10:56.710
uh customers and um select pick up uh customer groups.

03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720
customer groups.

03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:01.429
customer groups. So uh we have uh four with demo

03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439
So uh we have uh four with demo

03:11:01.439 --> 03:11:04.870
So uh we have uh four with demo demonstration data. The

03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880
demonstration data. The

03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:07.110
demonstration data. The uh there are regular ones like this all

03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:07.120
uh there are regular ones like this all

03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:10.150
uh there are regular ones like this all customers, partners, wholesale customers

03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160
customers, partners, wholesale customers

03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:13.190
customers, partners, wholesale customers and uh this is the one uh nonificated

03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200
and uh this is the one uh nonificated

03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:16.070
and uh this is the one uh nonificated visitors. This is the

03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080
visitors. This is the

03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:19.510
visitors. This is the uh group uh which is uh used for guest

03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520
uh group uh which is uh used for guest

03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:22.710
uh group uh which is uh used for guest users. Uh so uh whenever we have a guest

03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720
users. Uh so uh whenever we have a guest

03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:24.309
users. Uh so uh whenever we have a guest user

03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319
user

03:11:24.319 --> 03:11:28.389
user like here we have some uh

03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399
like here we have some uh

03:11:28.399 --> 03:11:32.469
like here we have some uh u anonymous guest guest customer user.

03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479
u anonymous guest guest customer user.

03:11:32.479 --> 03:11:37.269
u anonymous guest guest customer user. It was uh assigned this uh to this group

03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279
It was uh assigned this uh to this group

03:11:37.279 --> 03:11:41.990
It was uh assigned this uh to this group uh just to have like some common uh

03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000
uh just to have like some common uh

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:45.030
uh just to have like some common uh functionality uh shared uh not

03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040
functionality uh shared uh not

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:47.990
functionality uh shared uh not functionality maybe restrictions uh or

03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000
functionality maybe restrictions uh or

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.630
functionality maybe restrictions uh or permissions shared uh between the all

03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640
permissions shared uh between the all

03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:54.950
permissions shared uh between the all the guests. So that's the the reason of

03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960
the guests. So that's the the reason of

03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:57.590
the guests. So that's the the reason of combining them onto the separate

03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600
combining them onto the separate

03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:00.950
combining them onto the separate non-authenticated visitors group. Okay,

03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960
non-authenticated visitors group. Okay,

03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:03.429
non-authenticated visitors group. Okay, let me pick up uh let me go to

03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439
let me pick up uh let me go to

03:12:03.439 --> 03:12:05.349
let me pick up uh let me go to customers. While creating the customer

03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359
customers. While creating the customer

03:12:05.359 --> 03:12:09.110
customers. While creating the customer group uh specifying the owner which is a

03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120
group uh specifying the owner which is a

03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:12.630
group uh specifying the owner which is a um back office user

03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640
um back office user

uh the name of the uh

03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:20.070
uh the name of the uh okay test customer group text code let's

03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080
okay test customer group text code let's

03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:23.349
okay test customer group text code let's keep it and uh while creating we the

03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359
keep it and uh while creating we the

03:12:23.359 --> 03:12:27.269
keep it and uh while creating we the group we can pick up uh the

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:27.279
group we can pick up uh the

03:12:27.279 --> 03:12:29.830
group we can pick up uh the customers which should belong to the uh

03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840
customers which should belong to the uh

03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:32.870
customers which should belong to the uh to the group uh by uh clicking these uh

03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880
to the group uh by uh clicking these uh

03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:34.230
to the group uh by uh clicking these uh check boxes.

03:12:34.230 --> 03:12:34.240
check boxes.

03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:36.790
check boxes. priceless. Let's skip it. Yeah, that

03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800
priceless. Let's skip it. Yeah, that

03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:40.070
priceless. Let's skip it. Yeah, that that's that's actually it regarding

03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080
that's that's actually it regarding

03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:44.469
that's that's actually it regarding customer groups. Uh while uh so whenever

03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479
customer groups. Uh while uh so whenever

03:12:44.479 --> 03:12:47.269
customer groups. Uh while uh so whenever we have a customer um it could be

03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279
we have a customer um it could be

03:12:47.279 --> 03:12:49.910
we have a customer um it could be assigned only to single uh customer

03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920
assigned only to single uh customer

03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:52.070
assigned only to single uh customer group. So there is no out of the box

03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080
group. So there is no out of the box

03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.510
group. So there is no out of the box ability to assign uh different uh to to

03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520
ability to assign uh different uh to to

03:12:55.520 --> 03:12:58.150
ability to assign uh different uh to to assign the same customer to different

03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160
assign the same customer to different

03:12:58.160 --> 03:12:59.670
assign the same customer to different groups

03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680
groups

03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:02.070
groups depending on your needs. It could be

03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080
depending on your needs. It could be

03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:05.269
depending on your needs. It could be like this combining into into groups. It

03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279
like this combining into into groups. It

03:13:05.279 --> 03:13:07.269
like this combining into into groups. It could be handled by separate uh

03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279
could be handled by separate uh

03:13:07.279 --> 03:13:10.710
could be handled by separate uh functionality. Usually segments are used

03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720
functionality. Usually segments are used

03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:14.070
functionality. Usually segments are used for that purpose. So when it comes to to

03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080
for that purpose. So when it comes to to

03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:17.910
for that purpose. So when it comes to to the question how one of the options how

03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920
the question how one of the options how

03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:21.349
the question how one of the options how to organize u uh this many to many

03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359
to organize u uh this many to many

03:13:21.359 --> 03:13:23.590
to organize u uh this many to many relation between customer and groups it

03:13:23.590 --> 03:13:23.600
relation between customer and groups it

03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:27.349
relation between customer and groups it could be organized we using u segments

03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359
could be organized we using u segments

03:13:27.359 --> 03:13:31.429
could be organized we using u segments creating a segment which will contain u

03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439
creating a segment which will contain u

03:13:31.439 --> 03:13:35.670
creating a segment which will contain u a segment for the uh for the customer

03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680
a segment for the uh for the customer

03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:41.670
a segment for the uh for the customer like specifying here customer

03:13:41.680 --> 03:13:43.590
It actually doesn't matter and having a

03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600
It actually doesn't matter and having a

03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:46.150
It actually doesn't matter and having a segment then we can u and segment will

03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160
segment then we can u and segment will

03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:51.429
segment then we can u and segment will combine uh customers uh like have like a

03:13:51.429 --> 03:13:51.439
combine uh customers uh like have like a

03:13:51.439 --> 03:13:54.469
combine uh customers uh like have like a combination of customers um aggregated

03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479
combination of customers um aggregated

03:13:54.479 --> 03:13:57.269
combination of customers um aggregated under uh specific segment and then the

03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279
under uh specific segment and then the

03:13:57.279 --> 03:13:59.990
under uh specific segment and then the segment could be used for

03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000
segment could be used for

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.150
segment could be used for um

03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160
um

03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:04.550
um uh for limiting access for providing

03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560
uh for limiting access for providing

03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:07.110
uh for limiting access for providing specific settings but this is something

03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120
specific settings but this is something

03:14:07.120 --> 03:14:10.150
specific settings but this is something that is used as a customization I using

03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160
that is used as a customization I using

03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:13.590
that is used as a customization I using the segments uh for combining uh

03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600
the segments uh for combining uh

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:17.429
the segments uh for combining uh customers into groups. Okay.

03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439
customers into groups. Okay.

03:14:17.439 --> 03:14:24.950
customers into groups. Okay. Uh okay, then let's continue.

03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:26.630
Uh

03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640
Uh

03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:29.429
Uh yeah. And uh

03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439
yeah. And uh

03:14:29.439 --> 03:14:32.710
yeah. And uh we have a customer group. We can assign

03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720
we have a customer group. We can assign

03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:37.510
we have a customer group. We can assign uh some specific uh uh prices to the

03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520
uh some specific uh uh prices to the

03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:39.910
uh some specific uh uh prices to the whole group. And then those prices will

03:14:39.910 --> 03:14:39.920
whole group. And then those prices will

03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:43.269
whole group. And then those prices will be shared and uh displayed uh for all

03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279
be shared and uh displayed uh for all

03:14:43.279 --> 03:14:45.510
be shared and uh displayed uh for all customers of the group. And here is a

03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:45.520
customers of the group. And here is a

03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:49.190
customers of the group. And here is a listed alternative approach of u using

03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200
listed alternative approach of u using

03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:51.110
listed alternative approach of u using groups

03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120
groups

03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:53.910
groups specifically customer segments.

03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920
specifically customer segments.

03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:57.670
specifically customer segments. Yeah. And as I mentioned one uh customer

03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680
Yeah. And as I mentioned one uh customer

03:14:57.680 --> 03:14:59.830
Yeah. And as I mentioned one uh customer uh single customer could be assigned to

03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840
uh single customer could be assigned to

03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:05.190
uh single customer could be assigned to single uh customer group.

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:07.110
Okay. We have a customer which is a

03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120
Okay. We have a customer which is a

03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:10.630
Okay. We have a customer which is a company. Uh we have a customer groups

company. Uh we have a customer groups which groups companies with similar

03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520
which groups companies with similar

03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:16.870
which groups companies with similar behavior. Now we have users which are

03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880
behavior. Now we have users which are

03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:20.710
behavior. Now we have users which are actually uh real persons which actual

03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:20.720
actually uh real persons which actual

03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:23.429
actually uh real persons which actual persons which act on behalf of the

03:15:23.429 --> 03:15:23.439
persons which act on behalf of the

uh uh users sorry to the uh to the customers we have the ability to do it

03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160
customers we have the ability to do it

03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:53.670
customers we have the ability to do it while creating a customer user or while

03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:53.680
while creating a customer user or while

03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:55.910
while creating a customer user or while creating a customer. Let's I will

03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920
creating a customer. Let's I will

03:15:55.920 --> 03:15:59.349
creating a customer. Let's I will demonstrate it in a moment. Uh each

03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359
demonstrate it in a moment. Uh each

03:15:59.359 --> 03:16:01.910
demonstrate it in a moment. Uh each individual customer user may have some

03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920
individual customer user may have some

03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:04.309
individual customer user may have some uh actually it should have some

03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319
uh actually it should have some

03:16:04.319 --> 03:16:07.750
uh actually it should have some permissions. So imagine you have like uh

03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760
permissions. So imagine you have like uh

03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:09.990
permissions. So imagine you have like uh several employees of the C of the

03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000
several employees of the C of the

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:14.710
several employees of the C of the company, right? And one of them is

03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720
company, right? And one of them is

03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:21.269
company, right? And one of them is uh has uh more u u permissions u to

03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279
uh has uh more u u permissions u to

products. while another buyer has

03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:29.750
products. while another buyer has limited permissions and is not allowed

03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760
limited permissions and is not allowed

03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:32.550
limited permissions and is not allowed to purchase for instance some u products

03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560

additional approval from the from the

03:16:38.479 --> 03:16:41.990
additional approval from the from the manager. That's where uh the roles for

03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000
manager. That's where uh the roles for

is u the email and we can uh while configuring

03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040
configuring

03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:16.150
configuring our application we can specify uh

our application we can specify uh

03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:17.990
our application we can specify uh whether we would like to use case

03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000
whether we would like to use case

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.790
whether we would like to use case sensitive or case insensitive uh user

03:17:20.790 --> 03:17:20.800
sensitive or case insensitive uh user

03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:22.550
sensitive or case insensitive uh user emails. I will demonstrate in a moment

03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560
emails. I will demonstrate in a moment

03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:24.550
emails. I will demonstrate in a moment where to configure it. Let's switch back

03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560
where to configure it. Let's switch back

03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:28.070
where to configure it. Let's switch back to the menu uh to the back office.

03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080
to the menu uh to the back office.

03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:30.309
to the menu uh to the back office. Okay, we have a customer

03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319
Okay, we have a customer

03:17:30.319 --> 03:17:32.710
Okay, we have a customer uh customer users. But uh one second

03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720
uh customer users. But uh one second

03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:35.110
uh customer users. But uh one second before we go to customer users, I have

03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120
before we go to customer users, I have

03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:38.229
before we go to customer users, I have not uh mentioned about customer groups

03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:38.239
not uh mentioned about customer groups

03:17:38.239 --> 03:17:41.990
not uh mentioned about customer groups that on a customer group we have u like

03:17:41.990 --> 03:17:42.000
that on a customer group we have u like

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.670
that on a customer group we have u like this is the the third the fourth level

03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680
this is the the third the fourth level

03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:49.190
this is the the third the fourth level where uh

03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:49.200
where uh

03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:52.389
where uh settings could be configured. Um so

03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399
settings could be configured. Um so

03:17:52.399 --> 03:17:55.269
settings could be configured. Um so imagine I go to partners

03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279
imagine I go to partners

03:17:55.279 --> 03:17:59.510
imagine I go to partners uh customer group and here I am able to

03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520
uh customer group and here I am able to

03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:02.950
uh customer group and here I am able to specify uh like similar options uh for

03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960
specify uh like similar options uh for

03:18:02.960 --> 03:18:06.309
specify uh like similar options uh for the partners uh for the partners

03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319
the partners uh for the partners

03:18:06.319 --> 03:18:09.269
the partners uh for the partners customer group using a some different

03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279
customer group using a some different

03:18:09.279 --> 03:18:11.269
customer group using a some different navigation. So each time we have this

03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279
navigation. So each time we have this

03:18:11.279 --> 03:18:17.349
navigation. So each time we have this configuration. Uh so first um customer

03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359
configuration. Uh so first um customer

03:18:17.359 --> 03:18:19.830
configuration. Uh so first um customer settings are taken into account then as

03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840
settings are taken into account then as

03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:24.150
settings are taken into account then as a fallback u uh customer groups. If on

03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160
a fallback u uh customer groups. If on

03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:27.030
a fallback u uh customer groups. If on customer group nothing is specified no

03:18:27.030 --> 03:18:27.040
customer group nothing is specified no

03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:29.670
customer group nothing is specified no settings is specified then as a fallback

03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680
settings is specified then as a fallback

03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:33.030
settings is specified then as a fallback uh website uh configuration uh level is

03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040
uh website uh configuration uh level is

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:36.630
uh website uh configuration uh level is used. And uh the the last uh fallback uh

03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640
used. And uh the the last uh fallback uh

03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:40.309
used. And uh the the last uh fallback uh in this chain uh for settings is used u

03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319
in this chain uh for settings is used u

03:18:40.319 --> 03:18:42.309
in this chain uh for settings is used u uh global configuration level like four

03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319
uh global configuration level like four

03:18:42.319 --> 03:18:45.750
uh global configuration level like four levels customer group website and

03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760
levels customer group website and

checkout or shipping address and so on to use u the ability to use quick order

03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600
to use u the ability to use quick order

03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:14.070
to use u the ability to use quick order Chrome like that and some permissions

03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080
Chrome like that and some permissions

03:40:14.080 --> 03:40:16.710
Chrome like that and some permissions related to the workflows. If we click

03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:16.720
related to the workflows. If we click

03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:18.790
related to the workflows. If we click edit

03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800
edit

03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:22.070
edit and check

03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080
and check

03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:25.510
and check uh what kind of levels the permission

03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520
uh what kind of levels the permission

03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:34.150
uh what kind of levels the permission could have. Uh

03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:38.070
um so now I am demonstrating an order an

03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080
um so now I am demonstrating an order an

03:40:38.080 --> 03:40:41.830
um so now I am demonstrating an order an order entity for the administrator.

03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840
order entity for the administrator.

03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:46.150
order entity for the administrator. and uh permission to view orders. Uh so

03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160
and uh permission to view orders. Uh so

03:40:46.160 --> 03:40:50.710
and uh permission to view orders. Uh so with that um we have like four uh four

03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720
with that um we have like four uh four

03:40:50.720 --> 03:40:53.349
with that um we have like four uh four different levels. So level none will

03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359
different levels. So level none will

03:40:53.359 --> 03:40:55.429
different levels. So level none will which which will mean that we are not

03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439
which which will mean that we are not

03:40:55.439 --> 03:40:59.110
which which will mean that we are not allowing to view orders uh at all for

03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120
allowing to view orders uh at all for

03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:02.309
allowing to view orders uh at all for administrator with the level uh with the

03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319
administrator with the level uh with the

03:41:02.319 --> 03:41:06.229
administrator with the level uh with the level user. I will be only to see uh

03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239
level user. I will be only to see uh

03:41:06.239 --> 03:41:08.870
level user. I will be only to see uh those uh

03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880
those uh

03:41:08.880 --> 03:41:13.030
those uh uh orders uh which are owned by me which

03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040
uh orders uh which are owned by me which

were just created or placed uh by me u

03:41:16.640 --> 03:41:22.710
were just created or placed uh by me u Amanda Cole. If I set up as a u

03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720
Amanda Cole. If I set up as a u

03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:25.269
Amanda Cole. If I set up as a u type of this permission department, I

03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279
type of this permission department, I

03:41:25.279 --> 03:41:28.550
type of this permission department, I will see not only my own uh orders

03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560
will see not only my own uh orders

03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:32.150
will see not only my own uh orders created by me but also by other users of

created by me but also by other users of my uh of my department of my

03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720
my uh of my department of my

03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:39.990
my uh of my department of my subsidiary. And the last level is just

03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000
subsidiary. And the last level is just

03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:42.950
subsidiary. And the last level is just the the the higher the higher

03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960
the the the higher the higher

03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:45.269
the the the higher the higher permissions the higher the wider

03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279
permissions the higher the wider

03:41:45.279 --> 03:41:48.870
permissions the higher the wider permissions is to corporate level. It it

03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880
permissions is to corporate level. It it

03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:50.950
permissions is to corporate level. It it will means that I will be able to see

03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960
will means that I will be able to see

03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:54.150
will means that I will be able to see all orders created not only by uh

assigned to. Okay, this is the the difference between

03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920
Okay, this is the the difference between

03:42:11.920 --> 03:42:14.309
Okay, this is the the difference between different levels

03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319
different levels

03:42:14.319 --> 03:42:18.870
different levels and for

03:42:18.880 --> 03:42:22.150
difference with the uh with the buyer

03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:22.160
difference with the uh with the buyer

difference with the uh with the buyer role. Uh we may check that. Okay, I will

03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560
role. Uh we may check that. Okay, I will

03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:31.670
role. Uh we may check that. Okay, I will better view

03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680
better view

03:42:31.680 --> 03:42:33.830
better view and here I will go to the view page. It

03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840
and here I will go to the view page. It

03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:39.190
and here I will go to the view page. It will be more

03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:41.190
Um

03:42:41.190 --> 03:42:41.200
Um

03:42:41.200 --> 03:42:43.990
Um so you may see what kind of entities are

03:42:43.990 --> 03:42:44.000
so you may see what kind of entities are

03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:46.070
so you may see what kind of entities are and permissions over them are enabled

03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080
and permissions over them are enabled

03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:49.830

session ID at what time well yeah this

03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:37.990
session ID at what time well yeah this one this is the entity actually let's

03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000
one this is the entity actually let's

03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:39.990
one this is the entity actually let's check here

03:47:39.990 --> 03:47:40.000
check here

03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:43.110
check here um so this is the table where the entity

03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120
um so this is the table where the entity

03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:46.469
um so this is the table where the entity is uh the records of the visitors is

03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479
is uh the records of the visitors is

stored. It has some uh last visit, some

03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:53.429
stored. It has some uh last visit, some session ID just to to have a reference

03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439
session ID just to to have a reference

03:47:53.439 --> 03:47:57.030
session ID just to to have a reference and to to pick up

03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040
and to to pick up

03:47:57.040 --> 03:48:00.469
and to to pick up uh

03:48:00.479 --> 03:48:03.830
the data which was um which was created

03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840
the data which was um which was created

03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:07.429
the data which was um which was created within the same session. Um if uh

03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439
within the same session. Um if uh

03:48:07.439 --> 03:48:09.910
within the same session. Um if uh visitor is then transferred to the

03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920
visitor is then transferred to the

03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:12.389
visitor is then transferred to the customer user uh and becomes a

03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399
customer user uh and becomes a

03:48:12.399 --> 03:48:14.870
customer user uh and becomes a registered um visitor will also contain

03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880
registered um visitor will also contain

03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:18.389
registered um visitor will also contain a reference to the through this uh field

03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399
a reference to the through this uh field

03:48:18.399 --> 03:48:20.790
a reference to the through this uh field to the customer user

03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800
to the customer user

03:48:20.800 --> 03:48:24.630
to the customer user and I guess that's it u related to this

03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640
and I guess that's it u related to this

03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:27.269
and I guess that's it u related to this uh visitor.

03:48:27.269 --> 03:48:27.279
uh visitor.

03:48:27.279 --> 03:48:29.030
uh visitor. So actually this is like a starting

03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040
So actually this is like a starting

03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:32.870
So actually this is like a starting point for the guest users. Uh whenever

03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880
point for the guest users. Uh whenever

03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:34.630
point for the guest users. Uh whenever they are navigating to the website they

03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640
they are navigating to the website they

03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:37.990
they are navigating to the website they are recorded to this table with the

03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000
are recorded to this table with the

03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:41.750
are recorded to this table with the visit session ID. Then

03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760
visit session ID. Then

03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:45.590
visit session ID. Then if user is converted to the registered I

03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600
if user is converted to the registered I

03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:47.510
if user is converted to the registered I mean visitor sorry is converted to the

03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520
mean visitor sorry is converted to the

03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:50.229
mean visitor sorry is converted to the registered uh user then we will have

03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239
registered uh user then we will have

03:48:50.239 --> 03:48:54.309
registered uh user then we will have this reference and it will appear as a

03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319

Okay. And yeah, it's mostly useful for

03:49:07.279 --> 03:49:10.950
Okay. And yeah, it's mostly useful for for starting a checkout. U so in this

03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960
for starting a checkout. U so in this

03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:12.950
for starting a checkout. U so in this case, we would need to have as I

03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960
case, we would need to have as I

03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:15.189
case, we would need to have as I mentioned before. So check out this is

03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199
mentioned before. So check out this is

03:49:15.199 --> 03:49:18.150
mentioned before. So check out this is an entity which requires to have a

03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160
an entity which requires to have a

03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:23.269

requires then we would need to have this uh customer user entity created and for

03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000
uh customer user entity created and for

03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:33.110
uh customer user entity created and for particular visitor uh we will have this

03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120
particular visitor uh we will have this

03:49:33.120 --> 03:49:36.950
particular visitor uh we will have this uh user created but with the guest uh uh

03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960
uh user created but with the guest uh uh

03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:41.429
uh user created but with the guest uh uh cl uh set to yes uh so it will it will

03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439
cl uh set to yes uh so it will it will

03:49:41.439 --> 03:49:45.110
cl uh set to yes uh so it will it will have like limited uh permissions but on

03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120
have like limited uh permissions but on

03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:48.550
have like limited uh permissions but on the mint side will

03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560
the mint side will

03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:53.030
the mint side will meanwhile we will have this

03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040
meanwhile we will have this

03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:55.750
meanwhile we will have this data in place uh I mean the check out

03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760
data in place uh I mean the check out

03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:58.070
data in place uh I mean the check out created and we will be able to to track

03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080
created and we will be able to to track

03:49:58.080 --> 03:50:02.070
created and we will be able to to track this process from the back office.

03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080
this process from the back office.

03:50:02.080 --> 03:50:05.750
this process from the back office. Okay. And a couple of best practices.

03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760
Okay. And a couple of best practices.

03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:08.630
Okay. And a couple of best practices. Uh so both uh customer and customer

03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640
Uh so both uh customer and customer

03:50:08.640 --> 03:50:11.189
Uh so both uh customer and customer groups they uh can be used for repres to

03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199
groups they uh can be used for repres to

03:50:11.199 --> 03:50:15.990
groups they uh can be used for repres to represent the hierarchy uh in the

03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000
represent the hierarchy uh in the

03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:19.830
represent the hierarchy uh in the in the some sort of hierarchy. Uh so

03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840
in the some sort of hierarchy. Uh so

03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:21.990
in the some sort of hierarchy. Uh so remember customers can have like parent

03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000
remember customers can have like parent

03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:24.870
remember customers can have like parent child relation and with that we have we

03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880
child relation and with that we have we

03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:27.750
child relation and with that we have we can have like a subsidiary and some top

03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:27.760
can have like a subsidiary and some top

03:50:27.760 --> 03:50:30.309
can have like a subsidiary and some top level companies. Uh on the other hand

03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319
level companies. Uh on the other hand

03:50:30.319 --> 03:50:32.710
level companies. Uh on the other hand side the hierarchy could be organized

03:50:32.710 --> 03:50:32.720
side the hierarchy could be organized

03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:35.510
side the hierarchy could be organized using uh groups. We combine some

03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520
using uh groups. We combine some

03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:38.710
using uh groups. We combine some customers uh under certain group and

03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720
customers uh under certain group and

03:50:38.720 --> 03:50:42.870
customers uh under certain group and assign this uh yeah assign assign single

03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880
assign this uh yeah assign assign single

03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:45.189
assign this uh yeah assign assign single group to all the customers we would like

03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199
group to all the customers we would like

03:50:45.199 --> 03:50:51.110
group to all the customers we would like to have it to own it. And uh mostly

03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120
to have it to own it. And uh mostly

03:50:51.120 --> 03:50:52.950
to have it to own it. And uh mostly these groups which we are talking about

03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960
these groups which we are talking about

03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:56.950
these groups which we are talking about they were they used to um to separate

03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960
they were they used to um to separate

03:50:56.960 --> 03:50:59.830
they were they used to um to separate between um

03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840
between um

03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:02.870
between um those customers which has some kind of

03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880
those customers which has some kind of

03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:05.349
those customers which has some kind of statuses like this one is listed here.

providing one uh prices um for other

03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:24.950
providing one uh prices um for other status u u a bit higher prices will be

03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960
status u u a bit higher prices will be

03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:27.030
status u u a bit higher prices will be listed

03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040
listed

03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:30.150
listed uh and customer can be used to represent

03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:30.160
uh and customer can be used to represent

03:51:30.160 --> 03:51:33.830
uh and customer can be used to represent specific scope of rock. Um

03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840
specific scope of rock. Um

03:51:33.840 --> 03:51:37.269
specific scope of rock. Um yeah so they

03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279
yeah so they

03:51:37.279 --> 03:51:40.150
yeah so they and uh customer hierarchy yeah as I

03:51:40.150 --> 03:51:40.160
and uh customer hierarchy yeah as I

03:51:40.160 --> 03:51:44.950
and uh customer hierarchy yeah as I mentioned it is um usually represent the

03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960
mentioned it is um usually represent the

03:51:44.960 --> 03:51:48.070
mentioned it is um usually represent the hierarchy which is kind of reflects the

03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080
hierarchy which is kind of reflects the

03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:51.750
hierarchy which is kind of reflects the same hierarchy it is in organization

03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760
same hierarchy it is in organization

03:51:51.760 --> 03:51:53.910
same hierarchy it is in organization u

03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920
u

03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:56.790
u I guess that's it

03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800
I guess that's it

03:51:56.800 --> 03:52:01.189
I guess that's it um so before we go to questions and

03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199
um so before we go to questions and

03:52:01.199 --> 03:52:05.110
um so before we go to questions and answers was just brief uh recap, brief

03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120
answers was just brief uh recap, brief

03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:09.269
answers was just brief uh recap, brief summary. Uh

03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279
summary. Uh

03:52:09.279 --> 03:52:12.070
summary. Uh now we have started to talk about those

03:52:12.070 --> 03:52:12.080
now we have started to talk about those

03:52:12.080 --> 03:52:16.469
now we have started to talk about those u entities which are actually performing

03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479
u entities which are actually performing

03:52:16.479 --> 03:52:20.790
u entities which are actually performing uh purchases in a storefront and to them

03:52:20.790 --> 03:52:20.800
uh purchases in a storefront and to them

03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:24.150
uh purchases in a storefront and to them uh belongs customers which represent an

03:52:24.150 --> 03:52:24.160
uh belongs customers which represent an

03:52:24.160 --> 03:52:28.150
uh belongs customers which represent an organization. Then onto the customers we

03:52:28.150 --> 03:52:28.160
organization. Then onto the customers we

03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:32.710
organization. Then onto the customers we uh have real uh persons who are logging

03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720
uh have real uh persons who are logging

03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:34.630
uh have real uh persons who are logging in and purchasing these are customer

03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640
in and purchasing these are customer

03:52:34.640 --> 03:52:37.990
in and purchasing these are customer users. Uh customers could be organized

03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000
users. Uh customers could be organized

03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:40.950
users. Uh customers could be organized into groups when they own the same

03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960
into groups when they own the same

03:52:40.960 --> 03:52:43.269
into groups when they own the same behavior, should own the same behavior,

customer groups. And uh users uh while uh performing

03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359
uh performing

03:52:53.359 --> 03:52:57.429
uh performing uh some actions in a in a storefront,

03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439
uh some actions in a in a storefront,

03:52:57.439 --> 03:53:01.269
uh some actions in a in a storefront, they might have some limited access or

03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279
they might have some limited access or

03:53:01.279 --> 03:53:04.070
they might have some limited access or the other has granted more permissions.

03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080
the other has granted more permissions.

03:53:04.080 --> 03:53:06.950
the other has granted more permissions. Um yeah and it depends on your needs

03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960
Um yeah and it depends on your needs

03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:12.710
Um yeah and it depends on your needs what uh user uh permission to grant um

03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720
what uh user uh permission to grant um

03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:15.990
what uh user uh permission to grant um or limit access.

03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000
or limit access.

03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:18.550
or limit access. Okay, that's it. And now let's switch to

03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560
Okay, that's it. And now let's switch to

03:53:18.560 --> 03:53:21.590
Okay, that's it. And now let's switch to questions and answers.

03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600
questions and answers.

03:53:21.600 --> 03:53:23.910
questions and answers. Um

03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920
Um

03:53:23.920 --> 03:53:26.070
Um do we have a possibility to import

03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080
do we have a possibility to import

03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:31.269
do we have a possibility to import export data by chrome? Um so both import

03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279
export data by chrome? Um so both import

03:53:31.279 --> 03:53:34.790
export data by chrome? Um so both import uh and export data they are handled by

03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800
uh and export data they are handled by

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:39.349
uh and export data they are handled by uh so-called uh processors which um

03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359
uh so-called uh processors which um

03:53:39.359 --> 03:53:42.950
uh so-called uh processors which um includes like several steps. Uh let's

03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960
includes like several steps. Uh let's

03:53:42.960 --> 03:53:45.830
includes like several steps. Uh let's pick up u so we are talking it actually

03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840
pick up u so we are talking it actually

03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:47.189
pick up u so we are talking it actually doesn't matter about what we are

03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199
doesn't matter about what we are

03:53:47.199 --> 03:53:51.510
doesn't matter about what we are talking. Here we have an import uh uh

03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520
talking. Here we have an import uh uh

03:53:51.520 --> 03:53:55.990
talking. Here we have an import uh uh form uh and we are specifying the

03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000
form uh and we are specifying the

03:53:56.000 --> 03:53:58.630
form uh and we are specifying the uh we are specifying the file to use uh

03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640
uh we are specifying the file to use uh

03:53:58.640 --> 03:54:01.429
uh we are specifying the file to use uh for the import. Once we uh click import

03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439
for the import. Once we uh click import

03:54:01.439 --> 03:54:04.630
for the import. Once we uh click import file, we are providing the file to the

03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:04.640
file, we are providing the file to the

03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:08.790
file, we are providing the file to the processor and this uh processor runs

03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800
processor and this uh processor runs

03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:11.590
processor and this uh processor runs performs uh three steps. reads the file,

03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600
performs uh three steps. reads the file,

03:54:11.600 --> 03:54:15.269
performs uh three steps. reads the file, processes the file and writes uh the

03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279
processes the file and writes uh the

03:54:15.279 --> 03:54:18.950
processes the file and writes uh the outcome out the final results to the

03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960
outcome out the final results to the

03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:22.870
outcome out the final results to the database. Uh with that uh we can reuse

03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880
database. Uh with that uh we can reuse

03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:26.950
database. Uh with that uh we can reuse uh uh the same functionality like I'm

03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960
uh uh the same functionality like I'm

03:54:26.960 --> 03:54:31.510
uh uh the same functionality like I'm demonstrating right now. Reuse and uh

03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520
demonstrating right now. Reuse and uh

03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:34.710
demonstrating right now. Reuse and uh add u

03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720
add u

03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:37.110
add u scheduled job

uh and uh having this uh comment you can

03:55:13.279 --> 03:55:16.790
uh and uh having this uh comment you can reuse the processor u import process one

03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800
reuse the processor u import process one

03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:18.870
reuse the processor u import process one of the existing import processors if you

03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880
of the existing import processors if you

03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:20.550
of the existing import processors if you are talking about customer customer

03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560
are talking about customer customer

03:55:20.560 --> 03:55:23.990
are talking about customer customer users just reuse uh uh the same service

03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000
users just reuse uh uh the same service

03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:26.630
users just reuse uh uh the same service uh but simply provide for this service

03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640
uh but simply provide for this service

03:55:26.640 --> 03:55:29.030
uh but simply provide for this service the the source of the file and it will

03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040
the the source of the file and it will

03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:31.510
the the source of the file and it will handle uh

03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520
handle uh

03:55:31.520 --> 03:55:34.150
handle uh uh by

03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160
uh by

03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:36.630
uh by out ofthe-box logic.

out ofthe-box logic.

03:55:36.640 --> 03:55:40.710
out ofthe-box logic. So short answer uh yes it could be uh

03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720
So short answer uh yes it could be uh

03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:43.670
So short answer uh yes it could be uh used but for that you need first uh have

03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680
used but for that you need first uh have

03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:50.550
used but for that you need first uh have this uh uh chrome job uh chrome task um

03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560
this uh uh chrome job uh chrome task um

03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:53.910
this uh uh chrome job uh chrome task um defined uh and second decide what will

03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920
defined uh and second decide what will

03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:57.269
defined uh and second decide what will be the source of the uh of your data

03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279
be the source of the uh of your data

03:55:57.279 --> 03:56:01.189
be the source of the uh of your data where it should be located um to be

03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199
where it should be located um to be

03:56:01.199 --> 03:56:05.510

03:58:30.309 --> 03:58:30.319
otherwise we will we definitely we'll

03:58:30.319 --> 03:58:34.469
otherwise we will we definitely we'll focus on it in uh day four to change a

03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479

has to be done manually. Yeah to change

03:58:40.399 --> 03:58:43.110
has to be done manually. Yeah to change uh or can be uh can be moved

03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120
uh or can be uh can be moved

03:58:43.120 --> 03:58:45.030
uh or can be uh can be moved automatically dependent on certain

03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040
automatically dependent on certain

03:58:45.040 --> 03:58:49.269
automatically dependent on certain rules. Example, if purchases more than X

03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279
rules. Example, if purchases more than X

03:58:49.279 --> 03:58:52.630
rules. Example, if purchases more than X amount in one month, I got you.

03:58:52.630 --> 03:58:52.640
amount in one month, I got you.

03:58:52.640 --> 03:58:55.910
amount in one month, I got you. Yep. Out of the box, this should be done

03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920
Yep. Out of the box, this should be done

03:58:55.920 --> 03:58:58.790
Yep. Out of the box, this should be done manually. But uh such type of

03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800
manually. But uh such type of

03:58:58.800 --> 03:59:01.269
manually. But uh such type of customization that you've listed. Uh so

03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279
customization that you've listed. Uh so

03:59:01.279 --> 03:59:06.309
customization that you've listed. Uh so we then would have for instance uh this

03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319
we then would have for instance uh this

03:59:06.319 --> 03:59:09.750
we then would have for instance uh this uh some of the sorry schedule tasks

03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760
uh some of the sorry schedule tasks

03:59:09.760 --> 03:59:13.750
uh some of the sorry schedule tasks which will be performed uh uh on some uh

03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760
which will be performed uh uh on some uh

03:59:13.760 --> 03:59:17.590
which will be performed uh uh on some uh schedule once per day once per month and

03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600
schedule once per day once per month and

03:59:17.600 --> 03:59:20.710
schedule once per day once per month and we'll pick up customers check uh number

03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720
we'll pick up customers check uh number

03:59:20.720 --> 03:59:24.309
we'll pick up customers check uh number of uh purchases and then simply uh

03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319
of uh purchases and then simply uh

03:59:24.319 --> 03:59:28.870
of uh purchases and then simply uh change the group uh from one to another

03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880
change the group uh from one to another

03:59:28.880 --> 03:59:31.510
change the group uh from one to another out of the box. So manually it should be

03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520
out of the box. So manually it should be

03:59:31.520 --> 03:59:33.269
out of the box. So manually it should be short qu short answer it should be

03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279
short qu short answer it should be

03:59:33.279 --> 03:59:38.229
short qu short answer it should be performed manually for automatic um

03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239
performed manually for automatic um

03:59:38.239 --> 03:59:42.469
performed manually for automatic um changes scheduled tasks could be used

03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479
changes scheduled tasks could be used

03:59:42.479 --> 03:59:44.790
changes scheduled tasks could be used but this is customization.

03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800
but this is customization.

03:59:44.800 --> 03:59:47.349
but this is customization. Excellent. Thank you.

03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359
Excellent. Thank you.

03:59:47.359 --> 03:59:50.150
Excellent. Thank you. If we are migrating customers from other

03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160
If we are migrating customers from other

03:59:50.160 --> 03:59:52.710
If we are migrating customers from other platform then can we set the same

03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720
platform then can we set the same

03:59:52.720 --> 03:59:56.710
platform then can we set the same password to the Oro platform? uh if not

03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720
password to the Oro platform? uh if not

03:59:56.720 --> 03:59:59.670
password to the Oro platform? uh if not then how Oro can notify those customers

03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680
then how Oro can notify those customers

03:59:59.680 --> 04:00:02.389
then how Oro can notify those customers with reset password link. Okay. So

04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399
with reset password link. Okay. So

04:00:02.399 --> 04:00:07.110
with reset password link. Okay. So password uh uh there is um the for

04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120
password uh uh there is um the for

04:00:07.120 --> 04:00:09.990
password uh uh there is um the for security reasons uh it will not be uh

04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000
security reasons uh it will not be uh

04:00:10.000 --> 04:00:13.030
security reasons uh it will not be uh allowed to do the passwords are uh

04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040
allowed to do the passwords are uh

04:00:13.040 --> 04:00:16.389
allowed to do the passwords are uh hashed uh encoded and uh you would not

04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399
hashed uh encoded and uh you would not

04:00:16.399 --> 04:00:21.349
hashed uh encoded and uh you would not be able to do this. Uh but what was uh

04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359
be able to do this. Uh but what was uh

04:00:21.359 --> 04:00:24.309
be able to do this. Uh but what was uh one second I will check.

04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319
one second I will check.

04:00:24.319 --> 04:00:27.349
one second I will check. Do we have it?

04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359
Do we have it?

04:00:27.359 --> 04:00:30.389
Do we have it? Uh yeah, we have a customization uh for

04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399
Uh yeah, we have a customization uh for

04:00:30.399 --> 04:00:34.070
Uh yeah, we have a customization uh for this part. Uh so selecting u like

04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080
this part. Uh so selecting u like

04:00:34.080 --> 04:00:38.469
this part. Uh so selecting u like introducing uh mass action uh reset

04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479
introducing uh mass action uh reset

04:00:38.479 --> 04:00:39.990
introducing uh mass action uh reset password.

04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000
password.

04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:44.389
password. Okay, one second. And I will

04:00:44.399 --> 04:00:46.469
demonstrate

04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479
demonstrate

04:00:46.479 --> 04:00:52.389
demonstrate very quickly

04:00:52.399 --> 04:00:59.590
how it could be achieved

04:00:59.600 --> 04:01:06.070
us.

04:01:06.080 --> 04:01:08.790
Okay. One of the examples.

04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800
Okay. One of the examples.

04:01:08.800 --> 04:01:14.150
Okay. One of the examples. Uh so this is a demi data u don't pay

04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160
Uh so this is a demi data u don't pay

04:01:14.160 --> 04:01:16.950
Uh so this is a demi data u don't pay attention on it too much too much so um

04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960
attention on it too much too much so um

04:01:16.960 --> 04:01:19.269
attention on it too much too much so um introducing mass action for the customer

04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279
introducing mass action for the customer

04:01:19.279 --> 04:01:21.590
introducing mass action for the customer user so now I have selected like several

04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600
user so now I have selected like several

04:01:21.600 --> 04:01:23.990
user so now I have selected like several customer users going to the mass action

04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000
customer users going to the mass action

04:01:24.000 --> 04:01:28.229
customer users going to the mass action selection I can um click send reset

04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239
selection I can um click send reset

04:01:28.239 --> 04:01:30.790
selection I can um click send reset email and with that it will send uh

04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800
email and with that it will send uh

04:01:30.800 --> 04:01:33.429
email and with that it will send uh reset email for this uh for all this can

04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439
reset email for this uh for all this can

04:01:33.439 --> 04:01:37.349
reset email for this uh for all this can select all visible all or all all or all

04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359
select all visible all or all all or all

04:01:37.359 --> 04:01:41.670
select all visible all or all all or all all visible and u we sent email. This is

04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680
all visible and u we sent email. This is

04:01:41.680 --> 04:01:44.070
all visible and u we sent email. This is actually not a complex thing just

04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080
actually not a complex thing just

04:01:44.080 --> 04:01:45.990
actually not a complex thing just introducing mass action and assigning

04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000
introducing mass action and assigning

04:01:46.000 --> 04:01:49.030
introducing mass action and assigning this mass action to uh to the customer

04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040
this mass action to uh to the customer

04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:53.269
this mass action to uh to the customer user uh data grid.

04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279
user uh data grid.

04:01:53.279 --> 04:01:56.389
user uh data grid. So one more question so sending this

04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399
So one more question so sending this

04:01:56.399 --> 04:02:00.309
So one more question so sending this mass email through the platform is it

04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319
mass email through the platform is it

04:02:00.319 --> 04:02:02.630
mass email through the platform is it allowing are they blocking if there are

04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640
allowing are they blocking if there are

04:02:02.640 --> 04:02:05.110
allowing are they blocking if there are thousands of customer then how it is

04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120
thousands of customer then how it is

04:02:05.120 --> 04:02:06.229
thousands of customer then how it is managing?

04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239
managing?

04:02:06.239 --> 04:02:09.670
managing? Mhm. First of all, um the extension that

04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680
Mhm. First of all, um the extension that

04:02:09.680 --> 04:02:13.510
Mhm. First of all, um the extension that I was uh demonstrating uh it do has uh

04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520
I was uh demonstrating uh it do has uh

04:02:13.520 --> 04:02:16.950
I was uh demonstrating uh it do has uh some limitations u related to the batch

04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960
some limitations u related to the batch

04:02:16.960 --> 04:02:21.349
some limitations u related to the batch size and uh maximum number of u emails

04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359
size and uh maximum number of u emails

04:02:21.359 --> 04:02:25.670
size and uh maximum number of u emails to be sent in one like iteration. Uh on

04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680
to be sent in one like iteration. Uh on

04:02:25.680 --> 04:02:27.510
to be sent in one like iteration. Uh on the other hand side we do have some

04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520
the other hand side we do have some

04:02:27.520 --> 04:02:31.269
the other hand side we do have some limitations uh uh so again if you are

04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279
limitations uh uh so again if you are

04:02:31.279 --> 04:02:35.510
limitations uh uh so again if you are using or cloud uh for hosting your uh or

04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520
using or cloud uh for hosting your uh or

04:02:35.520 --> 04:02:38.229
using or cloud uh for hosting your uh or commerce application uh or cloud has

04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239
commerce application uh or cloud has

04:02:38.239 --> 04:02:41.189
commerce application uh or cloud has some limitations uh to the number of

04:02:41.189 --> 04:02:41.199
some limitations uh to the number of

04:02:41.199 --> 04:02:44.790
some limitations uh to the number of emails to be sent and but that should be

04:02:44.790 --> 04:02:44.800
emails to be sent and but that should be

04:02:44.800 --> 04:02:46.790
emails to be sent and but that should be checked uh like separately. What are the

04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800
checked uh like separately. What are the

04:02:46.800 --> 04:02:48.630
checked uh like separately. What are the limitations? They could be like

04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640
limitations? They could be like

04:02:48.640 --> 04:02:51.269
limitations? They could be like increased for uh for certain amount of

04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279
increased for uh for certain amount of

04:02:51.279 --> 04:02:55.110
increased for uh for certain amount of time. So if you would like to uh perform

04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120
time. So if you would like to uh perform

04:02:55.120 --> 04:02:58.070
time. So if you would like to uh perform u this uh sendings in in a short period

04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080
u this uh sendings in in a short period

04:02:58.080 --> 04:03:00.790
u this uh sendings in in a short period of time. So this could be negotiated. In

04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800
of time. So this could be negotiated. In

04:03:00.800 --> 04:03:03.750
of time. So this could be negotiated. In short, the extension I was demonstrated

04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760
short, the extension I was demonstrated

04:03:03.760 --> 04:03:06.710
short, the extension I was demonstrated it it already has some limitations and

04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720
it it already has some limitations and

04:03:06.720 --> 04:03:09.990
it it already has some limitations and on top we also do have limitations on or

04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000
on top we also do have limitations on or

04:03:10.000 --> 04:03:12.550
on top we also do have limitations on or cloud but that should be I don't really

04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560
cloud but that should be I don't really

04:03:12.560 --> 04:03:14.710
cloud but that should be I don't really remember what are the the numbers and

04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720
remember what are the the numbers and

04:03:14.720 --> 04:03:17.750
remember what are the the numbers and actually they might be negotiated uh

04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760
actually they might be negotiated uh

04:03:17.760 --> 04:03:20.150
actually they might be negotiated uh depending on the

04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160
depending on the

04:03:20.160 --> 04:03:24.229
depending on the um on the license or the contract you

04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640
So we have just speeded up a bit. Uh uh

04:03:44.640 --> 04:03:46.630
So we have just speeded up a bit. Uh uh with the customers

uh I was trying to

04:03:50.640 --> 04:03:53.830
uh I was trying to to save some time. Previous topics took

04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840
to save some time. Previous topics took

04:03:53.840 --> 04:03:57.110
to save some time. Previous topics took a bit more. But now we are more or less

04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120
a bit more. But now we are more or less

04:03:57.120 --> 04:04:00.070
a bit more. But now we are more or less in a in a schedule.

product to a brand

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:05.830
product to a brand uh unit of quantity. So we may sell uh

04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840
uh unit of quantity. So we may sell uh

04:13:05.840 --> 04:13:09.590
uh unit of quantity. So we may sell uh products out of the box in um units like

unit of quantity and uh additional unit.

04:13:45.439 --> 04:13:50.550
unit of quantity and uh additional unit. So imagine uh I will admit

04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560
So imagine uh I will admit

04:13:50.560 --> 04:13:52.950
So imagine uh I will admit imagine I would like to have a set which

04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960
imagine I would like to have a set which

04:13:52.960 --> 04:13:57.750
imagine I would like to have a set which contains of 10 items and depending uh

04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760
contains of 10 items and depending uh

04:13:57.760 --> 04:14:01.830
contains of 10 items and depending uh either this unit should be u visible in

04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840
either this unit should be u visible in

04:14:01.840 --> 04:14:06.070
either this unit should be u visible in a uh front storefront for picking up

04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080
a uh front storefront for picking up

04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:09.590
a uh front storefront for picking up sets of uh test one product. uh this

04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600
sets of uh test one product. uh this

04:14:09.600 --> 04:14:13.110
sets of uh test one product. uh this flag is used for. So if we enable it uh

04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120
flag is used for. So if we enable it uh

04:14:13.120 --> 04:14:15.830
flag is used for. So if we enable it uh the uh unit of measure will also be

04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840
the uh unit of measure will also be

04:14:15.840 --> 04:14:17.830
the uh unit of measure will also be available in the storefront. So it means

04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840
available in the storefront. So it means

04:14:17.840 --> 04:14:20.710
available in the storefront. So it means that this is a sellable unit. Then user

04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720
that this is a sellable unit. Then user

04:14:20.720 --> 04:14:23.590
that this is a sellable unit. Then user will be able to pick up uh this product

in not only item unit of quantity but also in sets text code. Let's keep it

04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720
also in sets text code. Let's keep it

04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:33.910
also in sets text code. Let's keep it for now. Uh short description uh pretty

04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920
for now. Uh short description uh pretty

you get kind of field. Uh plus it is a

04:14:41.040 --> 04:14:45.110
you get kind of field. Uh plus it is a localizable. So you can uh specify

04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120
localizable. So you can uh specify

04:14:45.120 --> 04:14:47.349

different localizations uh and either

04:14:50.720 --> 04:14:53.830
different localizations uh and either inherit from the uh default one which is

04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840
inherit from the uh default one which is

04:14:53.840 --> 04:14:57.670

um

04:19:28.880 --> 04:19:31.510
um u this is something that could be u done

04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520
u this is something that could be u done

04:19:31.520 --> 04:19:33.670
u this is something that could be u done by you using customization. So

04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680
by you using customization. So

04:19:33.680 --> 04:19:35.590
by you using customization. So introducing another template and just

04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600
introducing another template and just

04:19:35.600 --> 04:19:39.510
introducing another template and just using it across uh across uh all

04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520
using it across uh across uh all

04:19:39.520 --> 04:19:41.830
using it across uh across uh all products you have in a system or for

04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840
products you have in a system or for

04:19:41.840 --> 04:19:44.710
products you have in a system or for some specific products only using this

04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720
some specific products only using this

04:19:44.720 --> 04:19:47.830
some specific products only using this design uh design template uh design

04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840
design uh design template uh design

04:19:47.840 --> 04:19:50.710
design uh design template uh design settings. But usually it is enough to

04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720
settings. But usually it is enough to

04:19:50.720 --> 04:19:53.830
settings. But usually it is enough to have uh those the one which goes out of

04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840
have uh those the one which goes out of

04:19:53.840 --> 04:19:58.469
have uh those the one which goes out of the box. And um for the product um this

04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479
the box. And um for the product um this

04:19:58.479 --> 04:20:02.149
the box. And um for the product um this is the entity uh product entity we

04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159
is the entity uh product entity we

04:20:02.159 --> 04:20:04.309
is the entity uh product entity we always refer to it to check what kind of

04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319
always refer to it to check what kind of

04:20:04.319 --> 04:20:09.189
always refer to it to check what kind of option uh fields it owns.

04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199
option uh fields it owns.

04:20:09.199 --> 04:20:11.429
option uh fields it owns. Uh yeah but for sure this could be

04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439
Uh yeah but for sure this could be

04:20:11.439 --> 04:20:16.070
Uh yeah but for sure this could be extended. We will check it uh later.

04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080
extended. We will check it uh later.

04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:20.870
extended. We will check it uh later. Okay. Uh product entity and

04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880
Okay. Uh product entity and

04:20:20.880 --> 04:20:25.030
Okay. Uh product entity and let's uh continue.

04:20:25.040 --> 04:20:27.750
Uh so

04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760
Uh so

04:20:27.760 --> 04:20:34.149
Uh so when when we were checking uh product u

04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159
when when we were checking uh product u

04:20:34.159 --> 04:20:39.510
when when we were checking uh product u uh product u fields we have

04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520
uh product u fields we have

04:20:39.520 --> 04:20:41.590
uh product u fields we have stopped that u short description and

04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600
stopped that u short description and

04:20:41.600 --> 04:20:43.590
stopped that u short description and long description and I mentioned uh that

04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600
long description and I mentioned uh that

04:20:43.600 --> 04:20:46.790
long description and I mentioned uh that they are localizable fields. Uh so

04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800
they are localizable fields. Uh so

04:20:46.800 --> 04:20:49.110
they are localizable fields. Uh so having this localizable fields is

04:20:49.110 --> 04:20:49.120
having this localizable fields is

04:20:49.120 --> 04:20:51.670
having this localizable fields is organized using and by the way product

04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680
organized using and by the way product

04:20:51.680 --> 04:20:55.670
organized using and by the way product name is also a localizable field. Uh but

04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680
name is also a localizable field. Uh but

04:20:55.680 --> 04:21:00.790
name is also a localizable field. Uh but as this is of type u string uh it is

04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800
as this is of type u string uh it is

04:21:00.800 --> 04:21:05.110
as this is of type u string uh it is this is text rich text uh that's why

04:21:05.110 --> 04:21:05.120
this is text rich text uh that's why

04:21:05.120 --> 04:21:07.910
this is text rich text uh that's why this form is uh

04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920
this form is uh

04:21:07.920 --> 04:21:10.469
this form is uh represented in this way but uh for

04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479
represented in this way but uh for

04:21:10.479 --> 04:21:14.389
represented in this way but uh for simple values uh localizable fields are

04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399
simple values uh localizable fields are

04:21:14.399 --> 04:21:17.349
simple values uh localizable fields are presented using this icon clicking on it

04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359
presented using this icon clicking on it

04:21:17.359 --> 04:21:20.870
presented using this icon clicking on it I can uh specify uh the values for

different localizations I have in a

04:21:23.040 --> 04:21:25.830
different localizations I have in a system remember we like all these ones

04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840
system remember we like all these ones

04:21:25.840 --> 04:21:29.830

all uh localizable values extend from

04:22:12.399 --> 04:22:15.510
all uh localizable values extend from and it simply uh contains the uh

04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520
and it simply uh contains the uh

04:22:15.520 --> 04:22:18.950
and it simply uh contains the uh reference to the string

Nothing really special. um one of the default entities um which

04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399
um one of the default entities um which

04:22:52.399 --> 04:22:57.990
um one of the default entities um which use this localizable fallback um entity.

04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000
use this localizable fallback um entity.

04:22:58.000 --> 04:23:00.229
use this localizable fallback um entity. This is the

04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239
This is the

04:23:00.239 --> 04:23:03.590
This is the oops one second let me refresh what's

04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600
oops one second let me refresh what's

04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:05.510
oops one second let me refresh what's that

04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520
that

04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:07.510
that yeah this is the main entity for all

04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520
yeah this is the main entity for all

04:23:07.520 --> 04:23:10.710
yeah this is the main entity for all localizable fallback values and actually

04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720
localizable fallback values and actually

04:23:10.720 --> 04:23:13.990
localizable fallback values and actually a short description long description is

04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000
a short description long description is

04:23:14.000 --> 04:23:18.469
a short description long description is recorded uh using this entity

04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479
recorded uh using this entity

04:23:18.479 --> 04:23:22.550
recorded uh using this entity uh uh using this entity

04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560
uh uh using this entity

04:23:22.560 --> 04:23:25.349
uh uh using this entity we have some uh localization helper uh

04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359
we have some uh localization helper uh

04:23:25.359 --> 04:23:32.229
we have some uh localization helper uh to get values for the uh for the

04:23:32.239 --> 04:23:34.790
for the enabled localization I think uh

04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800
for the enabled localization I think uh

04:23:34.800 --> 04:23:36.710
for the enabled localization I think uh we have already checked it in

04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720
we have already checked it in

04:23:36.720 --> 04:23:38.309
we have already checked it in localization while talking about

04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319
localization while talking about

04:23:38.319 --> 04:23:41.429
localization while talking about localization per different websites but

04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439
localization per different websites but

04:23:41.439 --> 04:23:44.469
localization per different websites but let's pick up so this is ah yeah I was

04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479
let's pick up so this is ah yeah I was

04:23:44.479 --> 04:23:46.389
let's pick up so this is ah yeah I was demonstrating the service localization

04:23:46.389 --> 04:23:46.399
demonstrating the service localization

04:23:46.399 --> 04:23:51.429
demonstrating the service localization help helper um

04:23:51.439 --> 04:23:55.110
yeah it provides what kind of uh current

04:23:55.110 --> 04:23:55.120
yeah it provides what kind of uh current

04:23:55.120 --> 04:23:58.790
yeah it provides what kind of uh current localization is enabled all localization

04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800
localization is enabled all localization

04:23:58.800 --> 04:24:03.990
localization is enabled all localization and getting u localized value. Uh so um

04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000
and getting u localized value. Uh so um

04:24:04.000 --> 04:24:06.149
and getting u localized value. Uh so um so if we are talking about for instance

04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159
so if we are talking about for instance

04:24:06.159 --> 04:24:09.990
so if we are talking about for instance uh product description so um the

04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000
uh product description so um the

04:24:10.000 --> 04:24:13.750
uh product description so um the collection of all u localizable uh

04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760
collection of all u localizable uh

04:24:13.760 --> 04:24:15.990
collection of all u localizable uh product description are passed here and

04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000
product description are passed here and

04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:19.110
product description are passed here and based on either specific uh localization

04:24:19.110 --> 04:24:19.120
based on either specific uh localization

04:24:19.120 --> 04:24:22.070
based on either specific uh localization that is passed the value is uh is

04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080
that is passed the value is uh is

04:24:22.080 --> 04:24:23.590
that is passed the value is uh is provided

04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600
provided

04:24:23.600 --> 04:24:27.110
provided and uh get fullback value. This is in

04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120
and uh get fullback value. This is in

04:24:27.120 --> 04:24:29.990
and uh get fullback value. This is in the fallback trade.

04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000
the fallback trade.

04:24:30.000 --> 04:24:32.950
the fallback trade. Okay.

04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960
Okay.

04:24:32.960 --> 04:24:35.830
Okay. Uh product images, three types of

04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840
Uh product images, three types of

04:24:35.840 --> 04:24:40.950
Uh product images, three types of images. Main, listing, and additional

04:24:40.960 --> 04:24:43.510
main. This is the one listing. This is

04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520
main. This is the one listing. This is

04:24:43.520 --> 04:24:49.510
main. This is the one listing. This is the one.

04:24:49.520 --> 04:24:56.790
Oops.

04:24:56.800 --> 04:24:58.469
Yeah, you see that they are different

04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479
Yeah, you see that they are different

04:24:58.479 --> 04:25:00.870
Yeah, you see that they are different because we specified them differently in

04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880
because we specified them differently in

04:25:00.880 --> 04:25:04.630
because we specified them differently in a in a back office.

04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640
a in a back office.

04:25:04.640 --> 04:25:06.630
a in a back office. Um

04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640
Um

04:25:06.640 --> 04:25:10.309
Um those images which are uh stored uh per

04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319
those images which are uh stored uh per

04:25:10.319 --> 04:25:14.070
those images which are uh stored uh per the uh products uh they are handled by

04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080
the uh products uh they are handled by

04:25:14.080 --> 04:25:16.950
the uh products uh they are handled by the separate bundle which is uh

04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960
the separate bundle which is uh

04:25:16.960 --> 04:25:19.510
the separate bundle which is uh responsible for all uh attachments we

04:25:19.510 --> 04:25:19.520
responsible for all uh attachments we

04:25:19.520 --> 04:25:22.710
responsible for all uh attachments we have uh in the system. This is u

04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720
have uh in the system. This is u

04:25:22.720 --> 04:25:25.110
have uh in the system. This is u attachment bundle which is built on top

04:25:25.110 --> 04:25:25.120
attachment bundle which is built on top

04:25:25.120 --> 04:25:28.790
attachment bundle which is built on top of u this one li image bundle. We can

04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800
of u this one li image bundle. We can

04:25:28.800 --> 04:25:31.590
of u this one li image bundle. We can have uh we can specify

04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600
have uh we can specify

04:25:31.600 --> 04:25:35.830
have uh we can specify watermarks for the uh for the images and

04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840
watermarks for the uh for the images and

04:25:35.840 --> 04:25:39.030
watermarks for the uh for the images and they are available under system

04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040
they are available under system

04:25:39.040 --> 04:25:41.670
they are available under system configuration product images. By the way

04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680
configuration product images. By the way

04:25:41.680 --> 04:25:44.950
configuration product images. By the way there are not only watermarks uh options

04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960
there are not only watermarks uh options

04:25:44.960 --> 04:25:48.229
there are not only watermarks uh options u the settings. So here we can choose a

04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239
u the settings. So here we can choose a

04:25:48.239 --> 04:25:51.110
u the settings. So here we can choose a file to be as a watermark for all the

04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120
file to be as a watermark for all the

04:25:51.120 --> 04:25:54.630
file to be as a watermark for all the villages. Uh specify the size of it and

04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640
villages. Uh specify the size of it and

04:25:54.640 --> 04:25:58.469
villages. Uh specify the size of it and the position where to uh to present it.

04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479
the position where to uh to present it.

04:25:58.479 --> 04:26:01.030
the position where to uh to present it. Uh by u

04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040
Uh by u

04:26:01.040 --> 04:26:04.389
Uh by u by the way whenever we are introducing

04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399
by the way whenever we are introducing

04:26:04.399 --> 04:26:06.389
by the way whenever we are introducing u product

04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399
u product

04:26:06.399 --> 04:26:10.630
u product some product image changes the

04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640
some product image changes the

04:26:10.640 --> 04:26:12.950
some product image changes the especially this one introducing a

04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960
especially this one introducing a

04:26:12.960 --> 04:26:16.630
especially this one introducing a watermark for the images. the images uh

04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640
watermark for the images. the images uh

04:26:16.640 --> 04:26:19.990
watermark for the images. the images uh then for the products will be like

04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000
then for the products will be like

04:26:20.000 --> 04:26:23.189
then for the products will be like recalculated or repreprepared uh based

04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199
recalculated or repreprepared uh based

04:26:23.199 --> 04:26:26.229
recalculated or repreprepared uh based on this uh watermark. So if you have

04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239
on this uh watermark. So if you have

04:26:26.239 --> 04:26:29.590
on this uh watermark. So if you have like plenty of images in the system, so

04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600
like plenty of images in the system, so

04:26:29.600 --> 04:26:32.790
like plenty of images in the system, so it might take some time but it will be

04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800
it might take some time but it will be

04:26:32.800 --> 04:26:35.910
it might take some time but it will be handled in a as a background job uh to

04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920
handled in a as a background job uh to

04:26:35.920 --> 04:26:39.269
handled in a as a background job uh to to prepare this u this images with the

04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279
to prepare this u this images with the

04:26:39.279 --> 04:26:42.630
to prepare this u this images with the watermarks and we have the ability to uh

04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640
watermarks and we have the ability to uh

04:26:42.640 --> 04:26:46.070
watermarks and we have the ability to uh enable image preview on a product

04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080
enable image preview on a product

04:26:46.080 --> 04:26:49.830
enable image preview on a product listing page and specify either to use

04:26:49.830 --> 04:26:49.840
listing page and specify either to use

04:26:49.840 --> 04:26:52.550
listing page and specify either to use pop-up gallery uh on product preview or

04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560
pop-up gallery uh on product preview or

04:26:52.560 --> 04:26:55.110
pop-up gallery uh on product preview or not. So if I disable

04:26:55.110 --> 04:26:55.120
not. So if I disable

04:26:55.120 --> 04:26:58.070
not. So if I disable uh pop-up gallery on product view. So if

04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080
uh pop-up gallery on product view. So if

04:26:58.080 --> 04:27:01.750
uh pop-up gallery on product view. So if I go to the product view,

04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760
I go to the product view,

04:27:01.760 --> 04:27:05.349
I go to the product view, we do not have this popup uh anymore

04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359
we do not have this popup uh anymore

04:27:05.359 --> 04:27:07.990
we do not have this popup uh anymore which we've seen before.

04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000
which we've seen before.

04:27:08.000 --> 04:27:12.149
which we've seen before. And similar

04:27:12.159 --> 04:27:15.030
we can enable some preview on the

04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040
we can enable some preview on the

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:17.750
we can enable some preview on the listing page.

04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760
listing page.

04:27:17.760 --> 04:27:20.149
listing page. I have reverted my changes and let's

04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159
I have reverted my changes and let's

04:27:20.159 --> 04:27:22.469
I have reverted my changes and let's continue.

04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479
continue.

04:27:22.479 --> 04:27:24.229
continue. Okay, this is a configuration for

04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239
Okay, this is a configuration for

04:27:24.239 --> 04:27:29.030
Okay, this is a configuration for images. Uh so we have u like u having

04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040
images. Uh so we have u like u having

04:27:29.040 --> 04:27:32.389
images. Uh so we have u like u having different types of images also uh means

04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399
different types of images also uh means

04:27:32.399 --> 04:27:34.790
different types of images also uh means that uh these images like they are

04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800
that uh these images like they are

04:27:34.800 --> 04:27:36.950
that uh these images like they are stored in a database. On the other hand

04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960
stored in a database. On the other hand

04:27:36.960 --> 04:27:39.269
stored in a database. On the other hand side, they should be like prepared with

04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279
side, they should be like prepared with

04:27:39.279 --> 04:27:44.149
side, they should be like prepared with the proper uh dimensions uh uh for using

04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159
the proper uh dimensions uh uh for using

04:27:44.159 --> 04:27:47.590
the proper uh dimensions uh uh for using on different application pages. And

04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600
on different application pages. And

04:27:47.600 --> 04:27:50.070
on different application pages. And actually this configuration for the uh

04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080
actually this configuration for the uh

04:27:50.080 --> 04:27:53.429
actually this configuration for the uh default theme it lists uh the types of

04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439
default theme it lists uh the types of

04:27:53.439 --> 04:27:56.469
default theme it lists uh the types of images we have uh in a system like main

04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479
images we have uh in a system like main

04:27:56.479 --> 04:27:59.590
images we have uh in a system like main listing and additional uh the label for

listing and additional uh the label for those uh for those types and uh in what

04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199
those uh for those types and uh in what

04:28:03.199 --> 04:28:06.870
those uh for those types and uh in what uh dimensions it could be uh this uh

04:28:06.870 --> 04:28:06.880
uh dimensions it could be uh this uh

04:28:06.880 --> 04:28:11.189

the dimensions are listed uh here for instance for the product gallery uh

04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640
instance for the product gallery uh

04:28:16.640 --> 04:28:19.269
instance for the product gallery uh popup up. We should have the image width

04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279
popup up. We should have the image width

04:28:19.279 --> 04:28:23.990
popup up. We should have the image width and height equal to 710.

04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000
and height equal to 710.

04:28:24.000 --> 04:28:28.070
and height equal to 710. And uh whether we are able to we whether

04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080
And uh whether we are able to we whether

04:28:28.080 --> 04:28:31.590
And uh whether we are able to we whether we allow to apply product uh watermarks

04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600
we allow to apply product uh watermarks

04:28:31.600 --> 04:28:33.349
we allow to apply product uh watermarks the one we've seen in the configuration

04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359
the one we've seen in the configuration

04:28:33.359 --> 04:28:38.469
the one we've seen in the configuration or not. Uh so having uh this dimensions

04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479
or not. Uh so having uh this dimensions

04:28:38.479 --> 04:28:42.550
or not. Uh so having uh this dimensions and having uh types then uh the images

04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040
u this uh new type of image should be

04:29:11.040 --> 04:29:13.590
u this uh new type of image should be then use it in your uh in your

04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600
then use it in your uh in your

04:29:13.600 --> 04:29:16.070
then use it in your uh in your application

04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080
application

04:29:16.080 --> 04:29:18.070
application and two things are responsible for

04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080
and two things are responsible for

04:29:18.080 --> 04:29:20.229
and two things are responsible for product images uh not two things two

04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239
product images uh not two things two

04:29:20.239 --> 04:29:23.910
product images uh not two things two entities this is product image U entity

04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920
entities this is product image U entity

04:29:23.920 --> 04:29:27.910
entities this is product image U entity which is pretty easy one. Uh

04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920
which is pretty easy one. Uh

04:29:27.920 --> 04:29:30.070
which is pretty easy one. Uh uh it has a reference to the product to

04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080
uh it has a reference to the product to

04:29:30.080 --> 04:29:33.670
uh it has a reference to the product to the type uh even a collection of types

04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680
the type uh even a collection of types

04:29:33.680 --> 04:29:37.910
the type uh even a collection of types and and that's it updated. This is and

04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920
and and that's it updated. This is and

04:29:37.920 --> 04:29:40.870
and and that's it updated. This is and the type.

04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880
the type.

04:29:40.880 --> 04:29:42.229
the type. So this is something you would need to

04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239
So this is something you would need to

04:29:42.239 --> 04:29:43.990
So this is something you would need to refer if you would like to introduce new

04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000
refer if you would like to introduce new

04:29:44.000 --> 04:29:47.670
refer if you would like to introduce new type uh not only list and main and

04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680
type uh not only list and main and

04:29:47.680 --> 04:29:50.550
type uh not only list and main and additional just added additional record

04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560
additional just added additional record

04:29:50.560 --> 04:29:58.070
additional just added additional record for the uh product image type entity

04:29:58.080 --> 04:30:02.070
let's continue

04:30:02.080 --> 04:30:04.229
uh product units

04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239
uh product units

04:30:04.239 --> 04:30:06.790
uh product units okay product units I was demonstrating

04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800
okay product units I was demonstrating

04:30:06.800 --> 04:30:10.309
okay product units I was demonstrating here uh this is the section for product

04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319
here uh this is the section for product

04:30:10.319 --> 04:30:11.670
here uh this is the section for product units

04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680
units

04:30:11.680 --> 04:30:13.670
units uh remember I have specified that this

04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680
uh remember I have specified that this

04:30:13.680 --> 04:30:17.510
uh remember I have specified that this product is is the main unit is item and

04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520
product is is the main unit is item and

04:30:17.520 --> 04:30:21.429
product is is the main unit is item and also I am able to sell this unit in um

04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439
also I am able to sell this unit in um

04:30:21.439 --> 04:30:27.750
also I am able to sell this unit in um in sets. So and having uh this setup I

04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760
in sets. So and having uh this setup I

04:30:27.760 --> 04:30:31.429
in sets. So and having uh this setup I have both unit of u quantity available

04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439
have both unit of u quantity available

04:30:31.439 --> 04:30:36.149
have both unit of u quantity available here. So now if I disable uh cell uh

04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159
here. So now if I disable uh cell uh

04:30:36.159 --> 04:30:39.670
here. So now if I disable uh cell uh make it not sellable uh sets save the

04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680
make it not sellable uh sets save the

04:30:39.680 --> 04:30:41.910
make it not sellable uh sets save the changes

04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920
changes

04:30:41.920 --> 04:30:45.269
changes it will mean that I am not allowing to

04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279
it will mean that I am not allowing to

04:30:45.279 --> 04:30:49.670
it will mean that I am not allowing to uh to sell in sets and this uh set uh

04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680
uh to sell in sets and this uh set uh

04:30:49.680 --> 04:30:51.429
uh to sell in sets and this uh set uh unit will be simply used for some

04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439
unit will be simply used for some

04:30:51.439 --> 04:30:55.189
unit will be simply used for some internal purposes in some back office uh

04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199
internal purposes in some back office uh

04:30:55.199 --> 04:30:58.309
internal purposes in some back office uh logic maybe perform some computations.

04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319
logic maybe perform some computations.

04:30:58.319 --> 04:31:04.710
logic maybe perform some computations. It depends on your on your needs.

04:31:04.720 --> 04:31:07.349
Um

04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359
Um

04:31:07.359 --> 04:31:11.510
Um in some cases uh uh websites are running

04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520
in some cases uh uh websites are running

04:31:11.520 --> 04:31:16.070
in some cases uh uh websites are running uh products uh using single uh unit of

04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080
uh products uh using single uh unit of

04:31:16.080 --> 04:31:20.309
uh products uh using single uh unit of quantity and um just for instance in in

04:31:20.309 --> 04:31:20.319
quantity and um just for instance in in

04:31:20.319 --> 04:31:23.269
quantity and um just for instance in in items only right. Uh for that uh we

04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279
items only right. Uh for that uh we

04:31:23.279 --> 04:31:28.950
items only right. Uh for that uh we should have uh single no product unit

04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960
should have uh single no product unit

04:31:28.960 --> 04:31:32.149
should have uh single no product unit product unit for that we can enable uh

04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159
product unit for that we can enable uh

04:31:32.159 --> 04:31:36.309
product unit for that we can enable uh this mode uh uh single unit mode and you

04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319
this mode uh uh single unit mode and you

04:31:36.319 --> 04:31:40.070
this mode uh uh single unit mode and you will have uh just one single use just to

04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080
will have uh just one single use just to

04:31:40.080 --> 04:31:42.469
will have uh just one single use just to to make it uh

04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479
to make it uh

04:31:42.479 --> 04:31:45.269
to make it uh simple

04:31:45.269 --> 04:31:45.279
simple

04:31:45.279 --> 04:31:48.149
simple and for representation for instance no

04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159
and for representation for instance no

04:31:48.159 --> 04:31:51.269
and for representation for instance no then this item will not be listed here.

04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279
then this item will not be listed here.

04:31:51.279 --> 04:31:53.830
then this item will not be listed here. uh because all of them are sell in in

04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840
uh because all of them are sell in in

04:31:53.840 --> 04:31:56.790
uh because all of them are sell in in items. So it depends. So in some cases

04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800
items. So it depends. So in some cases

04:31:56.800 --> 04:32:00.950
items. So it depends. So in some cases this option is u enabled and

04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960
this option is u enabled and

04:32:00.960 --> 04:32:04.790
this option is u enabled and uh website is not loaded with additional

04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800
uh website is not loaded with additional

04:32:04.800 --> 04:32:08.229
uh website is not loaded with additional units.

04:32:08.239 --> 04:32:11.910
Okay. And these are product units. Let's

04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920
Okay. And these are product units. Let's

04:32:11.920 --> 04:32:13.910
Okay. And these are product units. Let's check what we have here. product unit

04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920
check what we have here. product unit

04:32:13.920 --> 04:32:15.990
check what we have here. product unit entity

04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000
entity

04:32:16.000 --> 04:32:17.590
entity which

04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600
which

04:32:17.600 --> 04:32:21.269
which um saves the code and some uh default uh

04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279
um saves the code and some uh default uh

04:32:21.279 --> 04:32:24.070
um saves the code and some uh default uh precision. So number of digits after

04:32:24.070 --> 04:32:24.080
precision. So number of digits after

04:32:24.080 --> 04:32:25.910
precision. So number of digits after after comma

04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920
after comma

04:32:25.920 --> 04:32:28.710
after comma and product unit precision. Yeah, that's

04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720
and product unit precision. Yeah, that's

04:32:28.720 --> 04:32:30.229
and product unit precision. Yeah, that's clear.

04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239
clear.

04:32:30.239 --> 04:32:33.189
clear. Okay, let's switch to more interesting

04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199
Okay, let's switch to more interesting

04:32:33.199 --> 04:32:35.910
Okay, let's switch to more interesting topic is product families.

04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920
topic is product families.

04:32:35.920 --> 04:32:39.030
topic is product families. Uh so product families uh they uh kind

04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040
Uh so product families uh they uh kind

04:32:39.040 --> 04:32:44.070
Uh so product families uh they uh kind of uh group uh uh products uh which has

04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080
of uh group uh uh products uh which has

04:32:44.080 --> 04:32:47.189
of uh group uh uh products uh which has some common uh attributes.

04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199
some common uh attributes.

04:32:47.199 --> 04:32:51.670
some common uh attributes. Uh so we imagine um here is

04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680
Uh so we imagine um here is

04:32:51.680 --> 04:32:54.070
Uh so we imagine um here is a good example. So imagine we are

04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080
a good example. So imagine we are

04:32:54.080 --> 04:32:58.870
a good example. So imagine we are selling TVs and selling t-shirts. Uh so

04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880
selling TVs and selling t-shirts. Uh so

04:32:58.880 --> 04:33:02.469
selling TVs and selling t-shirts. Uh so on one uh from one hand side both of

04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479
on one uh from one hand side both of

04:33:02.479 --> 04:33:05.429
on one uh from one hand side both of them has like name and vendor common

04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439
them has like name and vendor common

04:33:05.439 --> 04:33:08.230
them has like name and vendor common attributes while resolution and matrix

04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240
attributes while resolution and matrix

04:33:08.240 --> 04:33:10.070
attributes while resolution and matrix they are

04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080
they are

04:33:10.080 --> 04:33:11.590
they are they

04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600
they

04:33:11.600 --> 04:33:13.429
they should be available only for the TVs

04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439
should be available only for the TVs

04:33:13.439 --> 04:33:15.990
should be available only for the TVs while for the t-shirts uh t-shirts

04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000
while for the t-shirts uh t-shirts

04:33:16.000 --> 04:33:19.510
while for the t-shirts uh t-shirts should have size and color

04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520
should have size and color

04:33:19.520 --> 04:33:24.070
should have size and color uh and uh so then we should like group u

04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080
uh and uh so then we should like group u

04:33:24.080 --> 04:33:26.869
uh and uh so then we should like group u attributes uh for the t-shirts under

04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879
attributes uh for the t-shirts under

04:33:26.879 --> 04:33:29.670
attributes uh for the t-shirts under let's say t-shirt shirts uh attributes

04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680
let's say t-shirt shirts uh attributes

04:33:29.680 --> 04:33:32.390
let's say t-shirt shirts uh attributes have this set of attributes

04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400
have this set of attributes

04:33:32.400 --> 04:33:35.750
have this set of attributes uh while TVs will be grouped under

04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760
uh while TVs will be grouped under

04:33:35.760 --> 04:33:39.349
uh while TVs will be grouped under another family uh TVs.

04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359
another family uh TVs.

04:33:39.359 --> 04:33:41.750
another family uh TVs. Uh let's check what we have in a back

04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760
Uh let's check what we have in a back

04:33:41.760 --> 04:33:43.990
Uh let's check what we have in a back office related to this part. So we have

04:33:43.990 --> 04:33:44.000
office related to this part. So we have

04:39:00.959 --> 04:39:04.709
product attributes. Here is the list of them. And yeah, by the way, um here we

04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719
them. And yeah, by the way, um here we

04:39:04.719 --> 04:39:07.990
them. And yeah, by the way, um here we have a reference to what uh product

04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000
have a reference to what uh product

04:39:08.000 --> 04:39:10.390
have a reference to what uh product family it belongs. Um so imagine we have

04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400
family it belongs. Um so imagine we have

04:39:10.400 --> 04:39:12.310
family it belongs. Um so imagine we have a brand which should belong belong to

04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320
a brand which should belong belong to

04:39:12.320 --> 04:39:16.070
a brand which should belong belong to all uh product families. We have it will

04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080
all uh product families. We have it will

04:39:16.080 --> 04:39:18.869
all uh product families. We have it will they will be listed here while color for

04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879
they will be listed here while color for

04:39:18.879 --> 04:39:20.949
they will be listed here while color for instance should belong only to the

04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959
instance should belong only to the

04:39:20.959 --> 04:39:25.109
instance should belong only to the t-shirts. It will be listed here.

04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119
t-shirts. It will be listed here.

04:39:25.119 --> 04:39:34.789
t-shirts. It will be listed here. And

04:39:34.799 --> 04:39:38.150
and now let's um switch to configurable

04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160
and now let's um switch to configurable

04:39:38.160 --> 04:39:41.510
and now let's um switch to configurable products and I will uh actually

04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520
products and I will uh actually

04:39:41.520 --> 04:39:44.868
products and I will uh actually demonstrate uh how they should be

04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878
demonstrate uh how they should be

04:39:44.878 --> 04:39:47.910
demonstrate uh how they should be created um how they could be created and

04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920
created um how they could be created and

04:39:47.920 --> 04:39:52.310
created um how they could be created and how they uh look u in a storefront.

04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320
how they uh look u in a storefront.

04:39:52.320 --> 04:39:55.350
how they uh look u in a storefront. Uh so we have a simple product which is

04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360
Uh so we have a simple product which is

04:39:55.360 --> 04:39:59.270
Uh so we have a simple product which is uh uh product of single variant

04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280
uh uh product of single variant

04:39:59.280 --> 04:40:02.230
uh uh product of single variant uh while configurable it could be in

04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240
uh while configurable it could be in

04:40:02.240 --> 04:40:06.150
uh while configurable it could be in different variations. Uh

04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160
different variations. Uh

04:40:06.160 --> 04:40:11.350
different variations. Uh let me uh let's go quickly.

04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360
let me uh let's go quickly.

04:40:11.360 --> 04:40:14.150
let me uh let's go quickly. There are no uh configurable products uh

04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160
There are no uh configurable products uh

04:40:14.160 --> 04:40:17.750
There are no uh configurable products uh in within a demo data. We will create

04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760
in within a demo data. We will create

04:40:17.760 --> 04:40:21.030
in within a demo data. We will create them quickly. Okay. So use one of the

04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040
them quickly. Okay. So use one of the

04:40:21.040 --> 04:40:23.510
them quickly. Okay. So use one of the those that we've just created. Okay, we

04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520
those that we've just created. Okay, we

04:40:23.520 --> 04:40:25.990
those that we've just created. Okay, we have this test product

04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000
have this test product

04:40:26.000 --> 04:40:29.110
have this test product edit.

04:40:29.120 --> 04:40:33.510
Okay, I will specify it um

04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520
Okay, I will specify it um

04:40:33.520 --> 04:40:40.868
Okay, I will specify it um let's name it um okay be uh white. Okay.

04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878
let's name it um okay be uh white. Okay.

04:40:40.878 --> 04:40:48.070
let's name it um okay be uh white. Okay. And I will save the changes

04:40:48.080 --> 04:40:54.070
and I will duplicate uh the product

04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080
and I will duplicate uh the product

04:40:54.080 --> 04:40:57.430
and I will duplicate uh the product just for to speed up. So I have I have

just for to speed up. So I have I have duplicated let it be test

04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958
duplicated let it be test

04:41:00.958 --> 04:41:05.590
duplicated let it be test uh test two

04:41:05.600 --> 04:41:08.708
but it will be not white but black uh

04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718
but it will be not white but black uh

04:41:08.718 --> 04:41:14.868
but it will be not white but black uh product

04:41:14.878 --> 04:41:17.670
and I will add uh some other images for

04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680
and I will add uh some other images for

04:41:17.680 --> 04:41:21.030
and I will add uh some other images for this product this one

04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040
this product this one

this product this one and

04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360
and

04:41:23.360 --> 04:41:28.470
and let's just single

04:41:28.480 --> 04:41:30.788
Okay. So I have created and I will

04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798
Okay. So I have created and I will

04:41:30.798 --> 04:41:35.510
Okay. So I have created and I will enable it. Uh save and change. So we

04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520
enable it. Uh save and change. So we

04:41:35.520 --> 04:41:38.550
enable it. Uh save and change. So we have two simple products of different

04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560
have two simple products of different

04:41:38.560 --> 04:41:45.750
have two simple products of different variants. U one variant is uh

04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760
variants. U one variant is uh

04:41:45.760 --> 04:41:48.868
variants. U one variant is uh of color black.

04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878
of color black.

04:41:48.878 --> 04:41:50.868
of color black. another one

04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878
another one

04:41:50.878 --> 04:41:52.788
another one 65

65

04:41:52.798 --> 04:41:55.910
65 of color white and they have like

04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920
of color white and they have like

04:41:55.920 --> 04:41:58.708
of color white and they have like different SKUs um

04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718
different SKUs um

04:41:58.718 --> 04:42:01.350
different SKUs um as unique identifiers.

04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360
as unique identifiers.

04:42:01.360 --> 04:42:06.230
as unique identifiers. Um

04:42:06.240 --> 04:42:08.310
let's check whether they available both

04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320
let's check whether they available both

04:42:08.320 --> 04:42:13.430
let's check whether they available both of them in a storefront

04:42:13.440 --> 04:42:15.190
test.

04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200
test.

04:42:15.200 --> 04:42:17.430
test. Yeah, both of them are available. This

04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440
Yeah, both of them are available. This

04:42:17.440 --> 04:42:19.670
Yeah, both of them are available. This one and this one. Okay, we have two

04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680
one and this one. Okay, we have two

04:42:19.680 --> 04:42:22.150
one and this one. Okay, we have two simple products. Now, let's create a

04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160
simple products. Now, let's create a

04:42:22.160 --> 04:42:24.708
simple products. Now, let's create a configurable product which will be based

04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718
configurable product which will be based

04:42:24.718 --> 04:42:26.788
configurable product which will be based on these two products we have just

04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798
on these two products we have just

04:42:26.798 --> 04:42:28.390
on these two products we have just created.

04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400
created.

04:42:28.400 --> 04:42:34.390
created. Uh I will go to products, create product

04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400
Uh I will go to products, create product

04:42:34.400 --> 04:42:37.110
Uh I will go to products, create product and choose the type not uh simple but

04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120
and choose the type not uh simple but

04:42:37.120 --> 04:42:43.030
and choose the type not uh simple but configurable. I will pick up the sim.

04:42:43.040 --> 04:42:46.708
Continue.

04:42:46.718 --> 04:42:50.150
Okay. Now as I am created uh creating a

04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160
Okay. Now as I am created uh creating a

04:42:50.160 --> 04:42:52.150
Okay. Now as I am created uh creating a configurable product, I am able to

04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160
configurable product, I am able to

04:42:52.160 --> 04:42:54.310
configurable product, I am able to specify what kind of configurable

04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320
specify what kind of configurable

04:42:54.320 --> 04:42:55.830
specify what kind of configurable attributes

04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840
attributes

04:42:55.840 --> 04:42:59.510
attributes uh I should uh uh I should have for this

04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520
uh I should uh uh I should have for this

04:42:59.520 --> 04:43:01.030
uh I should uh uh I should have for this uh for this product for this

04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040
uh for this product for this

04:43:01.040 --> 04:43:03.910
uh for this product for this configurable product and uh uh

04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920
configurable product and uh uh

04:43:03.920 --> 04:43:06.628
configurable product and uh uh configurable attributes

04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638
configurable attributes

04:43:06.638 --> 04:43:09.750
configurable attributes uh which I which will be listed here. uh

04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760
uh which I which will be listed here. uh

04:43:09.760 --> 04:43:12.628
uh which I which will be listed here. uh you need first of all to have them

04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638
you need first of all to have them

04:43:12.638 --> 04:43:15.750
you need first of all to have them created to have them uh uh in a back

04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760
created to have them uh uh in a back

04:43:15.760 --> 04:43:18.628
created to have them uh uh in a back office created beforehand. Uh I've just

04:43:18.628 --> 04:43:18.638
office created beforehand. Uh I've just

04:43:18.638 --> 04:43:21.510
office created beforehand. Uh I've just created beforehand a color configurable

04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520
created beforehand a color configurable

04:43:21.520 --> 04:43:23.670
created beforehand a color configurable attribute. So it could be configured it

04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680
attribute. So it could be configured it

04:43:23.680 --> 04:43:26.788
attribute. So it could be configured it could be like u as it is a select field.

04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798
could be like u as it is a select field.

04:43:26.798 --> 04:43:30.230
could be like u as it is a select field. U we can then specify different options

04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240
U we can then specify different options

04:43:30.240 --> 04:43:33.670
U we can then specify different options per uh different values for this u for

04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680
per uh different values for this u for

04:43:33.680 --> 04:43:35.670
per uh different values for this u for this attribute. Another configurable

04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680
this attribute. Another configurable

04:43:35.680 --> 04:43:39.030
this attribute. Another configurable attribute could be multi select or uh

04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040
attribute could be multi select or uh

04:43:39.040 --> 04:43:43.990
attribute could be multi select or uh boolean uh field or integer field.

04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000
boolean uh field or integer field.

04:43:44.000 --> 04:43:46.628
boolean uh field or integer field. Yeah. And uh so I will pick up this one.

04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638
Yeah. And uh so I will pick up this one.

04:43:46.638 --> 04:43:49.270
Yeah. And uh so I will pick up this one. So if you had more and by the way u

04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280
So if you had more and by the way u

04:43:49.280 --> 04:43:51.510
So if you had more and by the way u those uh configurable attributes they

04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520
those uh configurable attributes they

04:43:51.520 --> 04:43:55.910
those uh configurable attributes they should be uh then added to the uh same

04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920
should be uh then added to the uh same

04:43:55.920 --> 04:43:58.948
should be uh then added to the uh same uh product family I am creating uh

04:43:58.948 --> 04:43:58.958
uh product family I am creating uh

04:43:58.958 --> 04:44:01.430

created and I have achieved this. I have

04:44:49.840 --> 04:44:53.670
created and I have achieved this. I have created uh uh sorry two variants uh

04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680
created uh uh sorry two variants uh

04:44:53.680 --> 04:44:57.510
created uh uh sorry two variants uh which are using u configurable attribute

04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520
which are using u configurable attribute

04:44:57.520 --> 04:45:00.230
which are using u configurable attribute created. So I have created test product

04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240
created. So I have created test product

04:45:00.240 --> 04:45:03.190
created. So I have created test product one with a color white and test product

04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200
one with a color white and test product

04:45:03.200 --> 04:45:06.470
one with a color white and test product two with a color black. Now I am

04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480
two with a color black. Now I am

04:45:06.480 --> 04:45:08.628
two with a color black. Now I am creating a configurable product. I am

04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638
creating a configurable product. I am

04:45:08.638 --> 04:45:10.470
creating a configurable product. I am specifying what kind of configurable

04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480
specifying what kind of configurable

04:45:10.480 --> 04:45:13.590
specifying what kind of configurable attribute I would like to use. color and

04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600
attribute I would like to use. color and

04:45:13.600 --> 04:45:15.750
attribute I would like to use. color and with that

04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760
with that

04:45:15.760 --> 04:45:18.390
with that it gives me an ability to specify

04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400
it gives me an ability to specify

04:45:18.400 --> 04:45:21.990
it gives me an ability to specify product varants uh which has color uh

04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000
product varants uh which has color uh

04:45:22.000 --> 04:45:25.030
product varants uh which has color uh attribute and I will pick up both of

04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040
attribute and I will pick up both of

04:45:25.040 --> 04:45:28.470
attribute and I will pick up both of them. I will save the changes. Uh one

04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480
them. I will save the changes. Uh one

04:45:28.480 --> 04:45:36.230
them. I will save the changes. Uh one second I will put it just simply test

04:45:36.240 --> 04:45:41.590
and make it enabled.

04:45:41.600 --> 04:45:45.510
So now I have two variants test one and

04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520
So now I have two variants test one and

04:45:45.520 --> 04:45:48.788
So now I have two variants test one and test two which are using one common uh

04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798
test two which are using one common uh

04:45:48.798 --> 04:45:52.470
test two which are using one common uh attribute color. Uh in one case this is

04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480
attribute color. Uh in one case this is

04:45:52.480 --> 04:45:55.990
attribute color. Uh in one case this is of color uh white and another color uh

04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000
of color uh white and another color uh

04:45:56.000 --> 04:45:59.270
of color uh white and another color uh black and all of them they are uh

04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280
black and all of them they are uh

04:45:59.280 --> 04:46:02.948
black and all of them they are uh aggregated or combined under one uh

04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958
aggregated or combined under one uh

04:46:02.958 --> 04:46:05.670
aggregated or combined under one uh configurable product. Let's check u how

04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680
configurable product. Let's check u how

04:46:05.680 --> 04:46:08.310
configurable product. Let's check u how it looks in a back office sorry in a

04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320
it looks in a back office sorry in a

04:46:08.320 --> 04:46:11.590
it looks in a back office sorry in a storefront.

04:46:11.600 --> 04:46:15.830
Okay, I will search for the

04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840
Okay, I will search for the

04:46:15.840 --> 04:46:18.390
Okay, I will search for the uh for the test again and see the

04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400
uh for the test again and see the

04:46:18.400 --> 04:46:20.310
uh for the test again and see the results. And now you see the difference.

04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320
results. And now you see the difference.

04:46:20.320 --> 04:46:24.070
results. And now you see the difference. So before that we have listed uh both um

04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080
So before that we have listed uh both um

04:46:24.080 --> 04:46:27.110
So before that we have listed uh both um two uh simple products test one and test

04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120
two uh simple products test one and test

04:46:27.120 --> 04:46:29.110
two uh simple products test one and test two. Now we have one configurable

04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120
two. Now we have one configurable

04:46:29.120 --> 04:46:34.310
two. Now we have one configurable product which u uh which simply uh has

04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320
product which u uh which simply uh has

04:46:34.320 --> 04:46:37.670
product which u uh which simply uh has variations uh of simple products. Let's

04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680
variations uh of simple products. Let's

04:46:37.680 --> 04:46:40.550
variations uh of simple products. Let's see the details. So, and here is the

04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560
see the details. So, and here is the

04:46:40.560 --> 04:46:43.910
see the details. So, and here is the configurable product uh test the one we

04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920
configurable product uh test the one we

04:46:43.920 --> 04:46:46.470
configurable product uh test the one we just created. And here I am able to

04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480
just created. And here I am able to

04:46:46.480 --> 04:46:49.510
just created. And here I am able to specify of what kind of variation uh I

04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520
specify of what kind of variation uh I

04:46:49.520 --> 04:46:51.430
specify of what kind of variation uh I would like this product to purchase.

04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440
would like this product to purchase.

04:46:51.440 --> 04:46:54.788
would like this product to purchase. Either I would like to purchase black or

04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798
Either I would like to purchase black or

04:46:54.798 --> 04:46:57.990
Either I would like to purchase black or white and depending on selected this

04:46:57.990 --> 04:46:58.000
white and depending on selected this

04:46:58.000 --> 04:47:02.390
white and depending on selected this form is refreshed to represent uh actual

04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400
form is refreshed to represent uh actual

04:47:02.400 --> 04:47:05.030
form is refreshed to represent uh actual prices because we are not uh not using

04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040
prices because we are not uh not using

04:47:05.040 --> 04:47:07.750
prices because we are not uh not using prices here.

04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760
prices here.

04:47:07.760 --> 04:47:11.590
prices here. um it doesn't change anything. Okay. So,

04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600
um it doesn't change anything. Okay. So,

04:47:11.600 --> 04:47:13.590
um it doesn't change anything. Okay. So, we have

04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600
we have

04:47:13.600 --> 04:47:17.910
we have this black uh and white uh

04:47:17.910 --> 04:47:17.920
this black uh and white uh

04:47:17.920 --> 04:47:21.110
this black uh and white uh variations of the configurable products.

04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120
variations of the configurable products.

04:47:21.120 --> 04:47:24.310
variations of the configurable products. And now let's uh let me switch back to

04:47:24.310 --> 04:47:24.320
And now let's uh let me switch back to

04:47:24.320 --> 04:47:28.310
And now let's uh let me switch back to the slides.

04:47:28.320 --> 04:47:31.990
And uh so what do we have? Uh we should

04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000
And uh so what do we have? Uh we should

04:47:32.000 --> 04:47:34.390
And uh so what do we have? Uh we should have uh products with multiple custom

04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400
have uh products with multiple custom

04:47:34.400 --> 04:47:36.550
have uh products with multiple custom variations. That's what we achieved. We

04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560
variations. That's what we achieved. We

04:47:36.560 --> 04:47:38.788
variations. That's what we achieved. We have u we have products of different

04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798
have u we have products of different

04:47:38.798 --> 04:47:42.390
have u we have products of different colors. Uh

04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400
colors. Uh

04:47:42.400 --> 04:47:43.830
colors. Uh yeah and they are grouped under

04:47:43.830 --> 04:47:43.840
yeah and they are grouped under

04:47:43.840 --> 04:47:49.350
yeah and they are grouped under configurable uh product and we have uh

04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360
configurable uh product and we have uh

04:47:49.360 --> 04:47:52.470
configurable uh product and we have uh followed the prerequisites.

04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480
followed the prerequisites.

04:47:52.480 --> 04:47:54.708
followed the prerequisites. uh we have created an attribute assigned

04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718
uh we have created an attribute assigned

04:47:54.718 --> 04:47:56.948
uh we have created an attribute assigned it to the product family and then we

04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958
it to the product family and then we

04:47:56.958 --> 04:48:00.150
it to the product family and then we were able to pick up product varants for

04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160
were able to pick up product varants for

04:48:00.160 --> 04:48:01.990
were able to pick up product varants for the configurable.

04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000
the configurable.

04:48:02.000 --> 04:48:03.910
the configurable. And in the system configuration we have

04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920
And in the system configuration we have

04:48:03.920 --> 04:48:06.948
And in the system configuration we have a couple of uh settings by which we can

04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958
a couple of uh settings by which we can

04:48:06.958 --> 04:48:10.150
a couple of uh settings by which we can configure how the configurable product

04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160
configure how the configurable product

04:48:10.160 --> 04:48:14.868
configure how the configurable product should look like in a storefront

04:48:14.878 --> 04:48:22.310
configuration.

04:48:22.320 --> 04:48:24.788
Okay. So under commerce product

04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798
Okay. So under commerce product

04:48:24.798 --> 04:48:26.948
Okay. So under commerce product configurable products

04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958
configurable products

04:48:26.958 --> 04:48:29.750
configurable products uh there is a couple of them especially

04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760
uh there is a couple of them especially

04:48:29.760 --> 04:48:35.350
uh there is a couple of them especially they uh uh define uh how we should uh

04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360
they uh uh define uh how we should uh

04:48:35.360 --> 04:48:39.510
they uh uh define uh how we should uh how we should

04:48:39.520 --> 04:48:43.430
present u the variance uh for selecting

04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440
present u the variance uh for selecting

04:48:43.440 --> 04:48:46.788
present u the variance uh for selecting u on the on the configurable product. So

04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798
u on the on the configurable product. So

04:48:46.798 --> 04:48:50.230
u on the on the configurable product. So by default we have this uh

04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240
by default we have this uh

04:48:50.240 --> 04:48:53.190
by default we have this uh one second I will reload inline inline

04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200
one second I will reload inline inline

04:48:53.200 --> 04:48:57.750
one second I will reload inline inline matrix form. So we are defining products

04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760
matrix form. So we are defining products

04:48:57.760 --> 04:49:01.510
matrix form. So we are defining products uh variance using inline form. Now I

04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520
uh variance using inline form. Now I

04:49:01.520 --> 04:49:04.788
uh variance using inline form. Now I will change for the product view I will

04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798
will change for the product view I will

04:49:04.798 --> 04:49:09.110
will change for the product view I will change uh no matrix form and for the

04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120
change uh no matrix form and for the

04:49:09.120 --> 04:49:12.470
change uh no matrix form and for the listing I will change uh popup matrix

04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480
listing I will change uh popup matrix

04:49:12.480 --> 04:49:17.720
listing I will change uh popup matrix one. Let's see. Save the changes.

04:49:17.730 --> 04:49:20.070
[Music]

04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080
[Music]

04:49:20.080 --> 04:49:23.970
[Music] Okay. So here I will refresh the page.

04:49:23.970 --> 04:49:23.980
Okay. So here I will refresh the page.

04:49:23.980 --> 04:49:27.830
Okay. So here I will refresh the page. [Music]

04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:38.390
One second.

04:49:38.400 --> 04:49:42.150
So what was uh let me check here. test

04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160
So what was uh let me check here. test

04:49:42.160 --> 04:49:48.628
So what was uh let me check here. test products or test view details.

04:49:48.638 --> 04:49:50.708
Uh,

04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718
Uh,

04:49:50.718 --> 04:49:58.230
Uh, okay. Have I saved? I do have, right?

04:49:58.240 --> 04:50:07.110
That's

04:50:07.120 --> 04:50:10.230
um

04:50:10.240 --> 04:50:12.310
why I don't uh why I didn't see the

04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320
why I don't uh why I didn't see the

04:50:12.320 --> 04:50:19.750
why I don't uh why I didn't see the changes. Uh okay, let me pick up.

04:50:19.760 --> 04:50:21.910
Okay,

04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920
Okay,

04:50:21.920 --> 04:50:37.750
Okay, configuration is saved. pop matrix form

04:50:37.760 --> 04:50:40.550
why I don't see the difference.

04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560
why I don't see the difference.

04:50:40.560 --> 04:50:42.470
why I don't see the difference. So I should have the difference in

04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480
So I should have the difference in

04:50:42.480 --> 04:50:45.830
So I should have the difference in details.

04:50:45.840 --> 04:50:47.750
Okay,

04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760
Okay,

04:50:47.760 --> 04:50:49.990
Okay, I will check later. Let's let me

04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000
I will check later. Let's let me

04:50:50.000 --> 04:50:52.868
I will check later. Let's let me demonstrate the difference

04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878
demonstrate the difference

04:50:52.878 --> 04:50:58.470
demonstrate the difference here.

04:50:58.480 --> 04:51:03.990
That's not it.

04:51:04.000 --> 04:51:05.990
This one

04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000
This one

04:51:06.000 --> 04:51:07.990
This one I will check why it is not working. So

04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000
I will check why it is not working. So

04:51:08.000 --> 04:51:12.070
I will check why it is not working. So if we have uh no matrix form uh we

04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080
if we have uh no matrix form uh we

04:51:12.080 --> 04:51:14.948
if we have uh no matrix form uh we should have like this kind of view when

04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958
should have like this kind of view when

04:51:14.958 --> 04:51:19.430
should have like this kind of view when this is inline um instead of uh

04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440
this is inline um instead of uh

04:51:19.440 --> 04:51:25.190
this is inline um instead of uh selecting uh items in a using this u

04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200
selecting uh items in a using this u

04:51:25.200 --> 04:51:27.990
selecting uh items in a using this u select fields we have this uh matrix

04:51:27.990 --> 04:51:28.000
select fields we have this uh matrix

04:51:28.000 --> 04:51:32.868
select fields we have this uh matrix form and putting uh the quantity in each

04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878
form and putting uh the quantity in each

04:51:32.878 --> 04:51:35.830
form and putting uh the quantity in each cell you are specifying of what uh

04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840
cell you are specifying of what uh

quantity you are of which which

04:51:38.160 --> 04:51:40.628
quantity you are of which which variation of what quantity you are you

04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638
variation of what quantity you are you

04:51:40.638 --> 04:51:44.310
variation of what quantity you are you would like to uh to purchase and within

04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320
would like to uh to purchase and within

04:51:44.320 --> 04:51:49.750
would like to uh to purchase and within a popup u there will be for selecting uh

04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760
a popup u there will be for selecting uh

04:51:49.760 --> 04:51:52.150
a popup u there will be for selecting uh the

04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160

04:51:52.160 --> 04:51:54.390
the products and quantity you would like to

04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400
products and quantity you would like to

04:51:54.400 --> 04:51:56.230
products and quantity you would like to purchase you will have a popup instead

04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240
purchase you will have a popup instead

04:51:56.240 --> 04:52:00.310
purchase you will have a popup instead of this uh table or this uh uh select

04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320
of this uh table or this uh uh select

04:52:00.320 --> 04:52:02.708
of this uh table or this uh uh select fields so these are the difference and

04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718
fields so these are the difference and

04:52:02.718 --> 04:52:05.590
fields so these are the difference and they are reflected on both that is what

04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600
they are reflected on both that is what

04:52:05.600 --> 04:52:07.110
they are reflected on both that is what I wanted to demonstrate

04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120
I wanted to demonstrate

04:52:07.120 --> 04:52:10.708
I wanted to demonstrate on both u product uh details page like

04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718
on both u product uh details page like

04:52:10.718 --> 04:52:13.990
on both u product uh details page like this one and on the product listing

04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000
this one and on the product listing

04:52:14.000 --> 04:52:17.110
this one and on the product listing page. So no matrix look like this uh

04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120
page. So no matrix look like this uh

04:52:17.120 --> 04:52:19.750
page. So no matrix look like this uh inline matrix form like this one and pop

04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760
inline matrix form like this one and pop

04:52:19.760 --> 04:52:25.990
inline matrix form like this one and pop up this uh let me check I will check

04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000
up this uh let me check I will check

04:52:26.000 --> 04:52:34.470
up this uh let me check I will check maybe a bit later. What kind of

04:52:34.480 --> 04:52:37.430
it should work uh pretty good. I don't

04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440
it should work uh pretty good. I don't

04:52:37.440 --> 04:52:41.990
it should work uh pretty good. I don't know. Uh one second. So we have set up

04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000
know. Uh one second. So we have set up

04:52:42.000 --> 04:52:43.910
know. Uh one second. So we have set up maybe I have missed something. Popup

04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920
maybe I have missed something. Popup

04:52:43.920 --> 04:52:47.190
maybe I have missed something. Popup matrix. Okay.

04:52:47.190 --> 04:52:47.200
matrix. Okay.

04:52:47.200 --> 04:52:53.830
matrix. Okay. Okay.

04:52:53.840 --> 04:52:59.030
Do I have the I have it running?

04:52:59.040 --> 04:53:01.510
They should see the changes immediately.

04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520
They should see the changes immediately.

04:53:01.520 --> 04:53:15.590
They should see the changes immediately. Test

04:53:15.600 --> 04:53:18.310
I am not able to purchase for the being

04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320
I am not able to purchase for the being

04:53:18.320 --> 04:53:20.150
I am not able to purchase for the being not registered.

04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160
not registered.

04:53:20.160 --> 04:53:36.070
not registered. Amen.

04:53:36.080 --> 04:53:39.190
Okay, I will check in a moment. Let's

04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200
Okay, I will check in a moment. Let's

04:53:39.200 --> 04:53:41.830
Okay, I will check in a moment. Let's continue for now.

04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840
continue for now.

04:53:41.840 --> 04:53:45.910
continue for now. [Music]

04:53:45.920 --> 04:53:49.590
Let's continue.

04:53:49.600 --> 04:53:51.910
Yeah. What is relevant for this? So uh

04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920
Yeah. What is relevant for this? So uh

04:53:51.920 --> 04:53:53.910
Yeah. What is relevant for this? So uh for this part for the configurable we

04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920
for this part for the configurable we

04:53:53.920 --> 04:53:55.670
for this part for the configurable we have variations

04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680
have variations

04:53:55.680 --> 04:53:59.190
have variations uh depending on a product attribute uh

04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200
uh depending on a product attribute uh

04:53:59.200 --> 04:54:03.270
uh depending on a product attribute uh which can have variation. We assign uh

04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280
which can have variation. We assign uh

04:54:03.280 --> 04:54:05.510
which can have variation. We assign uh this attribute which might have

04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520
this attribute which might have

04:54:05.520 --> 04:54:08.708
this attribute which might have variations to the configurable product

04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718
variations to the configurable product

04:54:08.718 --> 04:54:12.628
variations to the configurable product and then we have picked up uh variants

04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638
and then we have picked up uh variants

04:54:12.638 --> 04:54:16.470
and then we have picked up uh variants of the configurable products and it

04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480
of the configurable products and it

04:54:16.480 --> 04:54:19.910
of the configurable products and it helps then to combine uh all those

04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920
helps then to combine uh all those

04:54:19.920 --> 04:54:24.150
helps then to combine uh all those products uh and list under uh one single

04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160
products uh and list under uh one single

04:54:24.160 --> 04:54:26.948
products uh and list under uh one single uh one single product. And by the way

04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958
uh one single product. And by the way

04:54:26.958 --> 04:54:29.590
uh one single product. And by the way does it this part works uh simply

04:54:29.590 --> 04:54:29.600
does it this part works uh simply

04:54:29.600 --> 04:54:32.470
does it this part works uh simply variation everywhere hide from catalog

04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480
variation everywhere hide from catalog

04:54:32.480 --> 04:54:34.450
variation everywhere hide from catalog and search.

04:54:34.450 --> 04:54:34.460
and search.

04:54:34.460 --> 04:54:39.670
and search. [Music]

04:54:39.680 --> 04:54:42.550
We have an option to specify whether

04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560
We have an option to specify whether

04:54:42.560 --> 04:54:45.270
We have an option to specify whether variations should be visible in a

04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280
variations should be visible in a

04:54:45.280 --> 04:54:50.470
variations should be visible in a storefront or not. And uh so remember

04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480
storefront or not. And uh so remember

04:54:50.480 --> 04:54:53.990
storefront or not. And uh so remember before uh we created configurable we do

04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000
before uh we created configurable we do

04:54:54.000 --> 04:54:59.670
before uh we created configurable we do see uh we have seen uh both u simple uh

04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680
see uh we have seen uh both u simple uh

04:54:59.680 --> 04:55:03.190
see uh we have seen uh both u simple uh products in a uh list and page. Uh after

04:55:03.190 --> 04:55:03.200
products in a uh list and page. Uh after

04:55:03.200 --> 04:55:05.590
products in a uh list and page. Uh after we create it and as this option is

04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600
we create it and as this option is

04:55:05.600 --> 04:55:07.910
we create it and as this option is specified that we are hiding completely

04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920
specified that we are hiding completely

04:55:07.920 --> 04:55:11.830
specified that we are hiding completely we are hiding uh varants everywhere and

04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840
we are hiding uh varants everywhere and

04:55:11.840 --> 04:55:14.628
we are hiding uh varants everywhere and uh hide from the catalog and search.

04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638
uh hide from the catalog and search.

04:55:14.638 --> 04:55:16.708
uh hide from the catalog and search. Let's check

04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718
Let's check

04:55:16.718 --> 04:55:21.270
Let's check it works.

04:55:21.280 --> 04:55:26.628
Okay, I will test. Mhm.

04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638
Okay, I will test. Mhm.

04:55:26.638 --> 04:55:32.948
Okay, I will test. Mhm. I will pick up.

04:55:32.958 --> 04:55:35.110
Okay, I will check why matrix form is

04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120
Okay, I will check why matrix form is

04:55:35.120 --> 04:55:38.788
Okay, I will check why matrix form is not working. But it should be there is

04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798
not working. But it should be there is

04:55:38.798 --> 04:55:46.868
not working. But it should be there is no no rocket science with it. Should be

04:55:46.878 --> 04:55:51.670
Okay, I will check. Let's continue.

04:55:51.680 --> 04:55:55.590
We have uh we have checked how this um

04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600
We have uh we have checked how this um

04:55:55.600 --> 04:55:59.190
We have uh we have checked how this um type could be configured, how created.

04:55:59.190 --> 04:55:59.200
type could be configured, how created.

04:55:59.200 --> 04:56:01.190
type could be configured, how created. Now let's switch to product kit. Product

04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200
Now let's switch to product kit. Product

04:56:01.200 --> 04:56:03.750
Now let's switch to product kit. Product kit if I'm not mistaken it should be it

04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760
kit if I'm not mistaken it should be it

04:56:03.760 --> 04:56:08.310
kit if I'm not mistaken it should be it should exist in a in a storefront. So it

04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320
should exist in a in a storefront. So it

04:56:08.320 --> 04:56:11.910
should exist in a in a storefront. So it uh simply um

04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920
uh simply um

04:56:11.920 --> 04:56:16.390
uh simply um lists uh or aggregates the items which

04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400
lists uh or aggregates the items which

04:56:16.400 --> 04:56:19.590
lists uh or aggregates the items which are usually uh purchased together.

04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600
are usually uh purchased together.

04:56:19.600 --> 04:56:23.190
are usually uh purchased together. Imagine you are uh introducing a new

04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200
Imagine you are uh introducing a new

04:56:23.200 --> 04:56:26.230
Imagine you are uh introducing a new office and you would like to purchase uh

04:56:26.230 --> 04:56:26.240
office and you would like to purchase uh

04:56:26.240 --> 04:56:29.030
office and you would like to purchase uh furniture for this uh for for this off

04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040
furniture for this uh for for this off

04:56:29.040 --> 04:56:31.670
furniture for this uh for for this off for the office you are just opening. Uh

04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680
for the office you are just opening. Uh

04:56:31.680 --> 04:56:35.590
for the office you are just opening. Uh and usually when the office is uh

04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600
and usually when the office is uh

04:56:35.600 --> 04:56:37.590
and usually when the office is uh opening, you would need to purchase a

04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600
opening, you would need to purchase a

04:56:37.600 --> 04:56:41.750
opening, you would need to purchase a table, a bookshelf, some uh

04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760
table, a bookshelf, some uh

04:56:41.760 --> 04:56:44.868
table, a bookshelf, some uh uh workstation. And for that for you not

04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878
uh workstation. And for that for you not

04:56:44.878 --> 04:56:47.350
uh workstation. And for that for you not to for your convenience not to go and

04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360
to for your convenience not to go and

04:56:47.360 --> 04:56:50.230
to for your convenience not to go and pick up all those products uh from the

04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240
pick up all those products uh from the

04:56:50.240 --> 04:56:53.430
pick up all those products uh from the listing page. You might may introduce a

04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440
listing page. You might may introduce a

04:56:53.440 --> 04:56:55.830
listing page. You might may introduce a product kit which will contain all those

04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840
product kit which will contain all those

04:56:55.840 --> 04:56:57.750
product kit which will contain all those items that are usually purchased when

04:56:57.750 --> 04:56:57.760
items that are usually purchased when

04:56:57.760 --> 04:57:00.708
items that are usually purchased when you are uh purchasing when you are

opening a new office and uh uh those

04:57:04.958 --> 04:57:07.750
opening a new office and uh uh those products are purchased together. Okay,

04:57:07.750 --> 04:57:07.760
products are purchased together. Okay,

04:57:07.760 --> 04:57:11.590
products are purchased together. Okay, let's go to products. uh

04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600
let's go to products. uh

04:57:11.600 --> 04:57:13.830
let's go to products. uh this one.

04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840
this one.

04:57:13.840 --> 04:57:16.868
this one. So it was created beforehand and uh it

04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878
So it was created beforehand and uh it

04:57:16.878 --> 04:57:20.470
So it was created beforehand and uh it is of type product kit uh kit uh this is

and they are listed a bit different um so if I add let's add just uh to to

05:01:56.550 --> 05:01:56.560
um so if I add let's add just uh to to

05:01:56.560 --> 05:01:58.708
um so if I add let's add just uh to to demonstrate the difference I will add

05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718
demonstrate the difference I will add

05:01:58.718 --> 05:02:02.708
demonstrate the difference I will add this one.

05:02:02.718 --> 05:02:05.590
Uh so here is the the simple product I

05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600
Uh so here is the the simple product I

That's that's the difference. In some

05:02:37.200 --> 05:02:39.830
That's that's the difference. In some cases, it is called bundled bundled

05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840
cases, it is called bundled bundled

05:02:39.840 --> 05:02:44.150
cases, it is called bundled bundled products like that.

can enable it using u uh application

05:02:56.080 --> 05:02:57.910
can enable it using u uh application configuration. So here we have an

05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920
configuration. So here we have an

05:02:57.920 --> 05:03:00.390

05:03:17.280 --> 05:03:20.708
Okay. And the last thing I suppose we

05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718
Okay. And the last thing I suppose we

05:03:20.718 --> 05:03:25.750
Okay. And the last thing I suppose we will uh cover today is related to u how

05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760
will uh cover today is related to u how

05:03:25.760 --> 05:03:28.230
will uh cover today is related to u how we can uh

05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240
we can uh

05:03:28.240 --> 05:03:31.110
we can uh uh how we can import

05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120
uh how we can import

05:03:31.120 --> 05:03:33.670
uh how we can import product related data to the to the

05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680
product related data to the to the

05:03:33.680 --> 05:03:36.948
product related data to the to the system. Uh so that for that we have uh

05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958
system. Uh so that for that we have uh

05:03:36.958 --> 05:03:39.510
system. Uh so that for that we have uh product uh import functionality which

05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520
product uh import functionality which

05:03:39.520 --> 05:03:43.910
product uh import functionality which covers um importing uh product entities,

05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920
covers um importing uh product entities,

05:03:43.920 --> 05:03:47.510
covers um importing uh product entities, importing product images uh also related

05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520
importing product images uh also related

05:03:47.520 --> 05:03:50.310
importing product images uh also related products. Uh this is something uh which

05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320
products. Uh this is something uh which

05:03:50.320 --> 05:03:52.628
products. Uh this is something uh which is used for

05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638
is used for

05:03:52.638 --> 05:03:55.750
is used for uh one second let me close all these

05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760
uh one second let me close all these

05:03:55.760 --> 05:03:57.990
uh one second let me close all these parts

05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000
parts

05:03:58.000 --> 05:04:02.550
parts like here related products uh the the

05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560
like here related products uh the the

05:04:02.560 --> 05:04:06.550
like here related products uh the the relation between uh main product and uh

05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560
relation between uh main product and uh

05:04:06.560 --> 05:04:09.270
relation between uh main product and uh and some related products

05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280
and some related products

05:04:09.280 --> 05:04:11.270
and some related products uh

05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280
uh

05:04:11.280 --> 05:04:14.390
uh and also to import product attributes. I

05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400
and also to import product attributes. I

05:04:14.400 --> 05:04:17.830
and also to import product attributes. I will check I will demonstrate

05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840
will check I will demonstrate

05:04:17.840 --> 05:04:20.550
will check I will demonstrate And so if you go to products

05:04:20.550 --> 05:04:20.560
And so if you go to products

05:04:20.560 --> 05:04:23.190
And so if you go to products and go to import, we have different tabs

05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200
and go to import, we have different tabs

05:04:23.200 --> 05:04:25.750
and go to import, we have different tabs for importing products. This is the tab

05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760
for importing products. This is the tab

05:04:25.760 --> 05:04:29.670
for importing products. This is the tab for product im images. Uh another one

05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680
for product im images. Uh another one

05:04:29.680 --> 05:04:32.070
for product im images. Uh another one with another template. And by the way,

05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080
with another template. And by the way,

05:04:32.080 --> 05:04:35.430
with another template. And by the way, you would need to have a uh to make sure

05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440
you would need to have a uh to make sure

05:04:35.440 --> 05:04:41.110
you would need to have a uh to make sure that uh the uh import uh folder folder

05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120
that uh the uh import uh folder folder

05:04:41.120 --> 05:04:44.470
that uh the uh import uh folder folder for the products is u set up properly.

05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480
for the products is u set up properly.

05:04:44.480 --> 05:04:48.708
for the products is u set up properly. And u actually uh application has

05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718
And u actually uh application has

05:04:48.718 --> 05:04:50.788
And u actually uh application has permissions to to read the data from

05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798
permissions to to read the data from

05:04:50.798 --> 05:04:54.390
permissions to to read the data from there. Um this is the the section which

05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400
there. Um this is the the section which

05:04:54.400 --> 05:04:57.110
there. Um this is the the section which is uh responsible for importing related

05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120
is uh responsible for importing related

05:04:57.120 --> 05:04:59.750
is uh responsible for importing related products price attributes. This is

05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760
products price attributes. This is

05:04:59.760 --> 05:05:02.070
products price attributes. This is something related to prices and what I

05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080
something related to prices and what I

05:05:02.080 --> 05:05:05.430
something related to prices and what I also mentioned is about uh importing

05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440
also mentioned is about uh importing

05:05:05.440 --> 05:05:07.670
also mentioned is about uh importing product attributes. So you can create

05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680
product attributes. So you can create

05:05:07.680 --> 05:05:10.310
product attributes. So you can create them one by one manually using create

05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320
them one by one manually using create

05:05:10.320 --> 05:05:12.150
them one by one manually using create attribute

05:05:12.150 --> 05:05:12.160
attribute

05:05:12.160 --> 05:05:15.750
attribute or you can simply import input them um

05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760
or you can simply import input them um

05:05:15.760 --> 05:05:18.470
or you can simply import input them um just a whole list specifying in what

05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480
just a whole list specifying in what

05:05:18.480 --> 05:05:21.350
just a whole list specifying in what family they uh to what product family

05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360
family they uh to what product family

05:05:21.360 --> 05:05:25.910
family they uh to what product family they belong um of what type

05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920
they belong um of what type

05:05:25.920 --> 05:05:28.230
they belong um of what type and so on.

05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240
and so on.

05:05:28.240 --> 05:05:31.190
and so on. This is also done for your convenience.

05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200
This is also done for your convenience.

05:05:31.200 --> 05:05:34.948
This is also done for your convenience. At this uh moment I would stop. Um I

05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958
At this uh moment I would stop. Um I

05:05:34.958 --> 05:05:39.110
At this uh moment I would stop. Um I will cover the master catalog tomorrow

05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120
will cover the master catalog tomorrow

05:05:39.120 --> 05:05:42.390
will cover the master catalog tomorrow uh together with the uh with the web

05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400
uh together with the uh with the web

05:05:42.400 --> 05:05:46.708
uh together with the uh with the web catalog. Maybe it will be more even more

05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718
catalog. Maybe it will be more even more

05:05:46.718 --> 05:05:51.030
catalog. Maybe it will be more even more useful. I will also check uh why um in

05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040
useful. I will also check uh why um in

05:05:51.040 --> 05:05:53.670
useful. I will also check uh why um in my case uh this configuration was not

05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680
my case uh this configuration was not

05:05:53.680 --> 05:05:57.590
my case uh this configuration was not working uh for the matrix form uh for

05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600
working uh for the matrix form uh for

05:05:57.600 --> 05:06:00.470
working uh for the matrix form uh for the configurable. That's really looks

05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480
the configurable. That's really looks

05:06:00.480 --> 05:06:02.868
the configurable. That's really looks weird. Maybe I I missed something but I

05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878
weird. Maybe I I missed something but I

05:06:02.878 --> 05:06:05.190
weird. Maybe I I missed something but I will check that offline.

05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200
will check that offline.

05:06:05.200 --> 05:06:09.110
will check that offline. Okay. And uh so now let's switch to

05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120
Okay. And uh so now let's switch to

05:06:09.120 --> 05:06:11.590
Okay. And uh so now let's switch to questions and answers. We have like 12

05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:11.600
questions and answers. We have like 12

05:06:11.600 --> 05:06:13.990
questions and answers. We have like 12 minutes more.

05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000
minutes more.

05:06:14.000 --> 05:06:17.350
minutes more. And uh so the first question can we

05:06:17.350 --> 05:06:17.360
And uh so the first question can we

05:06:17.360 --> 05:06:20.868
And uh so the first question can we create custom flags?

05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878
create custom flags?

05:06:20.878 --> 05:06:24.150
create custom flags? I suppose you are referring to the flags

05:06:24.150 --> 05:06:24.160
I suppose you are referring to the flags

05:06:24.160 --> 05:06:28.310
I suppose you are referring to the flags uh which I was demonstrating here.

05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320
uh which I was demonstrating here.

05:06:28.320 --> 05:06:32.390
uh which I was demonstrating here. Product uh create product uh no

05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400
Product uh create product uh no

05:06:32.400 --> 05:06:35.430
Product uh create product uh no I will pick up uh

05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440
I will pick up uh

05:06:35.440 --> 05:06:39.590
I will pick up uh custom flex I when I was talking about

05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600
custom flex I when I was talking about

05:06:39.600 --> 05:06:41.510
custom flex I when I was talking about product I mentioned about this flag is

05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520
product I mentioned about this flag is

05:06:41.520 --> 05:06:45.510
product I mentioned about this flag is featured new arrival. Um these are flex

05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520
featured new arrival. Um these are flex

05:06:45.520 --> 05:06:48.628
featured new arrival. Um these are flex for filtering uh products and preparing

05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638
for filtering uh products and preparing

05:06:48.638 --> 05:06:51.590
for filtering uh products and preparing some segments of products. Yes, you can

05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600
some segments of products. Yes, you can

05:06:51.600 --> 05:06:54.708
some segments of products. Yes, you can uh uh so all the entities not all the

05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718
uh uh so all the entities not all the

05:06:54.718 --> 05:06:58.390
uh uh so all the entities not all the entities but uh most of the entities um

05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400
entities but uh most of the entities um

05:06:58.400 --> 05:07:00.550
entities but uh most of the entities um in Orocommerce they are extendable

05:07:00.550 --> 05:07:00.560
in Orocommerce they are extendable

05:07:00.560 --> 05:07:03.270
in Orocommerce they are extendable entities which gives you the ability to

05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280
entities which gives you the ability to

05:07:03.280 --> 05:07:07.350
entities which gives you the ability to create uh uh fields uh to extend them

05:07:07.350 --> 05:07:07.360
create uh uh fields uh to extend them

05:07:07.360 --> 05:07:09.990
create uh uh fields uh to extend them with additional fields and this could be

05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000
with additional fields and this could be

05:07:10.000 --> 05:07:13.270
with additional fields and this could be actually performed u using

05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280
actually performed u using

05:07:13.280 --> 05:07:18.230
actually performed u using u schema migration u in code there are

05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240
u schema migration u in code there are

05:07:18.240 --> 05:07:22.150
u schema migration u in code there are like migrations u mig ation files in

05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160
like migrations u mig ation files in

05:07:22.160 --> 05:07:25.030
like migrations u mig ation files in which you define what uh entity you

05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040
which you define what uh entity you

05:07:25.040 --> 05:07:27.990
which you define what uh entity you would like to extend with what uh field

05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000
would like to extend with what uh field

05:07:28.000 --> 05:07:30.788
would like to extend with what uh field you would like to extend and uh what

05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798
you would like to extend and uh what

05:07:30.798 --> 05:07:33.670
you would like to extend and uh what kind of options this field should have

05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680
kind of options this field should have

05:07:33.680 --> 05:07:36.628
kind of options this field should have like type uh should it be visible in a

05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638
like type uh should it be visible in a

05:07:36.638 --> 05:07:40.230
like type uh should it be visible in a data grid uh and so on and so on. So yes

05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240
data grid uh and so on and so on. So yes

05:07:40.240 --> 05:07:42.150
data grid uh and so on and so on. So yes you are able to create uhhuh and the

05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160
you are able to create uhhuh and the

05:07:42.160 --> 05:07:45.190
you are able to create uhhuh and the other thing is you can create uh

05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200
other thing is you can create uh

05:07:45.200 --> 05:07:48.070
other thing is you can create uh attributes not attributes but fields uh

05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080
attributes not attributes but fields uh

05:07:48.080 --> 05:07:50.470
attributes not attributes but fields uh using entity management. So we have

05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480
using entity management. So we have

05:07:50.480 --> 05:07:54.230
using entity management. So we have entities. So here is a list of entities

05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240
entities. So here is a list of entities

05:07:54.240 --> 05:07:56.470
entities. So here is a list of entities and you may see what kind of entities

05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480
and you may see what kind of entities

05:07:56.480 --> 05:08:00.230
and you may see what kind of entities are extendable. We can pick up any

05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240
are extendable. We can pick up any

05:08:00.240 --> 05:08:03.830
are extendable. We can pick up any entity. This is actually accepted not

05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840
entity. This is actually accepted not

05:08:03.840 --> 05:08:05.670
entity. This is actually accepted not only for

05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680
only for

05:08:05.680 --> 05:08:08.708
only for the products but also for the for other

05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718
the products but also for the for other

05:08:08.718 --> 05:08:11.910
the products but also for the for other entities we were

05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920
entities we were

05:08:11.920 --> 05:08:15.430
entities we were um like this one customer.

05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440
um like this one customer.

05:08:15.440 --> 05:08:17.110
um like this one customer. Imagine I would like to have some

05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120
Imagine I would like to have some

05:08:17.120 --> 05:08:19.030
Imagine I would like to have some additional flag or field for the

05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040
additional flag or field for the

05:08:19.040 --> 05:08:23.830
additional flag or field for the customer. Uh and you can uh create field

05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840
customer. Uh and you can uh create field

05:08:23.840 --> 05:08:26.550
customer. Uh and you can uh create field specify the the type

05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560
specify the the type

05:08:26.560 --> 05:08:29.910
specify the the type the storage type the field name and

05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920
the storage type the field name and

05:08:29.920 --> 05:08:33.350
the storage type the field name and create both customer product

05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360
create both customer product

05:08:33.360 --> 05:08:37.430
create both customer product uh customer user and so on.

05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440
uh customer user and so on.

05:08:37.440 --> 05:08:40.708
uh customer user and so on. In general a recommendation u better to

05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718
In general a recommendation u better to

05:08:40.718 --> 05:08:44.390
In general a recommendation u better to create uh these fields u extend entities

05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400
create uh these fields u extend entities

05:08:44.400 --> 05:08:47.830
create uh these fields u extend entities with the fields you uh migration uh from

05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840
with the fields you uh migration uh from

05:08:47.840 --> 05:08:50.948
with the fields you uh migration uh from code with that you will have the same um

05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958
code with that you will have the same um

05:08:50.958 --> 05:08:55.510
code with that you will have the same um the same state uh on all the entities uh

05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520
the same state uh on all the entities uh

05:08:55.520 --> 05:08:58.788
the same state uh on all the entities uh oh sorry on all the environments u uh

05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798
oh sorry on all the environments u uh

05:08:58.798 --> 05:09:00.868
oh sorry on all the environments u uh where you have your application running

05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878
where you have your application running

05:09:00.878 --> 05:09:03.510
where you have your application running on the dev uh on your local instance

05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520
on the dev uh on your local instance

05:09:03.520 --> 05:09:05.990
on the dev uh on your local instance sharing your code with other developers

05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000
sharing your code with other developers

05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:10.550
sharing your code with other developers you will have the same uh uh fields and

05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560
you will have the same uh uh fields and

05:09:10.560 --> 05:09:13.830
you will have the same uh uh fields and same state. Okay. The next question, can

05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840
same state. Okay. The next question, can

05:09:13.840 --> 05:09:17.750
same state. Okay. The next question, can we add videos uh to gallery? Uh so you

05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760
we add videos uh to gallery? Uh so you

05:09:17.760 --> 05:09:21.830
we add videos uh to gallery? Uh so you are able to add attachments uh to the

05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840
are able to add attachments uh to the

05:09:21.840 --> 05:09:24.550
are able to add attachments uh to the no attachments and the videos I guess

05:09:24.550 --> 05:09:24.560
no attachments and the videos I guess

05:09:24.560 --> 05:09:27.590
no attachments and the videos I guess you u mentioned some maybe

05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600
you u mentioned some maybe

05:09:27.600 --> 05:09:31.110
you u mentioned some maybe uh YouTube videos. uh to what I remember

05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120
uh YouTube videos. uh to what I remember

05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:34.230
uh YouTube videos. uh to what I remember this is not achieved uh out of the box

05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240
this is not achieved uh out of the box

05:09:34.240 --> 05:09:37.670
this is not achieved uh out of the box but actually this is not but um there

05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680
but actually this is not but um there

05:09:37.680 --> 05:09:41.590
but actually this is not but um there are several extensions I faced which

05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600
are several extensions I faced which

05:09:41.600 --> 05:09:46.010
are several extensions I faced which should handle this uh this thing

05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020
should handle this uh this thing

05:09:46.020 --> 05:09:49.590
should handle this uh this thing [Music]

05:09:49.600 --> 05:09:53.750
extension

05:09:53.760 --> 05:09:56.550
what this is a usual uh thing that is

05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560
what this is a usual uh thing that is

05:09:56.560 --> 05:10:03.910
what this is a usual uh thing that is customized

05:10:03.920 --> 05:10:14.948

But actually out of the box, no. But

05:11:09.760 --> 05:11:12.230
But actually out of the box, no. But usually this is customized uh through

05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240
usually this is customized uh through

05:11:12.240 --> 05:11:14.868
usually this is customized uh through the extensions or through the through

05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878
the extensions or through the through

05:11:14.878 --> 05:11:18.470
the extensions or through the through your code.

05:11:18.480 --> 05:11:21.590
Okay. Can we attach to product files to

05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600
Okay. Can we attach to product files to

05:11:21.600 --> 05:11:24.230
Okay. Can we attach to product files to download? Yeah, sure. Mhm. Same for

05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240

field with the type file and uh let me

05:11:39.040 --> 05:11:41.990
field with the type file and uh let me check.

05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000
check.

05:11:42.000 --> 05:11:50.070
check. Um

05:11:50.080 --> 05:11:51.990
so products already have this

05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000
so products already have this

05:11:52.000 --> 05:11:55.510
so products already have this attachments. uh

05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520
attachments. uh

05:11:55.520 --> 05:12:01.590
attachments. uh attachments

05:12:01.600 --> 05:12:03.110
but these are attachments for the

05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120
but these are attachments for the

05:12:03.120 --> 05:12:06.708
but these are attachments for the related entity for the activities. Uh

05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718
related entity for the activities. Uh

05:12:06.718 --> 05:12:10.628
related entity for the activities. Uh yeah, you would need to to add a field

05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638
yeah, you would need to to add a field

05:12:10.638 --> 05:12:12.150
yeah, you would need to to add a field um

05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160
um

05:12:12.160 --> 05:12:17.270
um uh attribute to add an attribute

05:12:17.280 --> 05:12:21.910
with the type uh file here and u maybe

05:12:21.910 --> 05:12:21.920
with the type uh file here and u maybe

05:12:21.920 --> 05:12:24.550
with the type uh file here and u maybe it will be some PDF, some certificates

05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560
it will be some PDF, some certificates

05:12:24.560 --> 05:12:28.550
it will be some PDF, some certificates uh specify of what uh by the way okay

05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560
uh specify of what uh by the way okay

05:12:28.560 --> 05:12:30.628
uh specify of what uh by the way okay document

05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638
document

05:12:30.638 --> 05:12:32.708
document continue

05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718
continue

05:12:32.718 --> 05:12:35.670
continue of what uh

05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680
of what uh

05:12:35.680 --> 05:12:40.070
of what uh type it should be of what size of what

05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080
type it should be of what size of what

05:12:40.080 --> 05:12:43.910
type it should be of what size of what type uh the file should be. Yeah. And it

05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920
type uh the file should be. Yeah. And it

05:12:43.920 --> 05:12:45.750
type uh the file should be. Yeah. And it will be then available specify whether

05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760
will be then available specify whether

05:12:45.760 --> 05:12:48.230
will be then available specify whether it should be available for the front end

05:12:48.230 --> 05:12:48.240
it should be available for the front end

05:12:48.240 --> 05:12:51.750
it should be available for the front end or not like this one added to the some

05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760
or not like this one added to the some

05:12:51.760 --> 05:12:53.830
or not like this one added to the some specific attribute group and it will be

05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840
specific attribute group and it will be

05:12:53.840 --> 05:12:56.390
specific attribute group and it will be there and same could be performed for

05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400
there and same could be performed for

05:12:56.400 --> 05:13:02.390
there and same could be performed for the for any other extendable entities.

05:13:02.400 --> 05:13:05.590
Uh can we add uh custom attributes to

05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600
Uh can we add uh custom attributes to

05:13:05.600 --> 05:13:08.788
Uh can we add uh custom attributes to customers? Yes, we can. Uh so I have

05:13:08.788 --> 05:13:08.798
customers? Yes, we can. Uh so I have

05:13:08.798 --> 05:13:11.510
customers? Yes, we can. Uh so I have demonstrated using management entity

05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520
demonstrated using management entity

05:13:11.520 --> 05:13:15.750
demonstrated using management entity management or but I recommend to use uh

05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760
management or but I recommend to use uh

05:13:15.760 --> 05:13:23.670
management or but I recommend to use uh migrations in uh code.

05:13:23.680 --> 05:13:30.310
Okay, let's quickly for instance

05:13:30.320 --> 05:13:37.990
migrations schema

05:13:38.000 --> 05:13:40.310
just as an example. So here we have in

05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320
just as an example. So here we have in

05:13:40.320 --> 05:13:44.390
just as an example. So here we have in your customization in your uh bundle you

05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400
your customization in your uh bundle you

05:13:44.400 --> 05:13:47.030
your customization in your uh bundle you will have u you would need to specify a

05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040
will have u you would need to specify a

05:13:47.040 --> 05:13:50.150
will have u you would need to specify a migr to add a migrations folder under

05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160
migr to add a migrations folder under

05:13:50.160 --> 05:13:53.430
migr to add a migrations folder under schema. This is the folder which is

05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440
schema. This is the folder which is

05:13:53.440 --> 05:13:57.270
schema. This is the folder which is responsible for database schema changes.

05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280
responsible for database schema changes.

05:13:57.280 --> 05:14:00.390
responsible for database schema changes. And here under some version

05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400
And here under some version

05:14:00.400 --> 05:14:02.708
And here under some version you are specifying what kind of changes

05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718
you are specifying what kind of changes

05:14:02.718 --> 05:14:05.190
you are specifying what kind of changes you would like to perform uh like for

05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200
you would like to perform uh like for

05:14:05.200 --> 05:14:07.190
you would like to perform uh like for this uh

05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200
this uh

05:14:07.200 --> 05:14:10.948
this uh creating additional entity or changing

05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958
creating additional entity or changing

05:14:10.958 --> 05:14:14.070
creating additional entity or changing uh changing the existing entity adding

05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080
uh changing the existing entity adding

05:14:14.080 --> 05:14:17.110
uh changing the existing entity adding some uh uh some relation. So in this

05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120
some uh uh some relation. So in this

05:14:17.120 --> 05:14:19.190
some uh uh some relation. So in this case you see that we are adding some

05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200
case you see that we are adding some

05:14:19.200 --> 05:14:22.070
case you see that we are adding some image relation to the to one of the

05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080
image relation to the to one of the

05:14:22.080 --> 05:14:25.430
image relation to the to one of the tables and specifying the options and

05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440
tables and specifying the options and

05:14:25.440 --> 05:14:30.150
tables and specifying the options and you may pick up the examples from code

05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160
you may pick up the examples from code

05:14:30.160 --> 05:14:37.110
you may pick up the examples from code uh from from code

05:14:37.120 --> 05:14:39.990
here for the customer entity.

05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000
here for the customer entity.

05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:44.230
here for the customer entity. uh plenty of migrations

05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240
uh plenty of migrations

05:14:44.240 --> 05:14:47.430
uh plenty of migrations removing some fields changing and and so

05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440
removing some fields changing and and so

05:14:47.440 --> 05:14:49.350
removing some fields changing and and so on.

05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360
on.

05:14:49.360 --> 05:14:51.910
on. Okay, the next question is there any

05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920
Okay, the next question is there any

05:14:51.920 --> 05:14:55.030
Okay, the next question is there any product type where non-variance can be a

05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040
product type where non-variance can be a

05:14:55.040 --> 05:14:57.190
product type where non-variance can be a child product in the grid view for

05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200
child product in the grid view for

05:14:57.200 --> 05:14:59.830
child product in the grid view for configurable products? Thinking about

05:14:59.830 --> 05:14:59.840
configurable products? Thinking about

05:14:59.840 --> 05:15:02.628
configurable products? Thinking about magenta grouped products as an example.

05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638
magenta grouped products as an example.

05:15:02.638 --> 05:15:06.150
magenta grouped products as an example. Sorry, I am not uh really aware about

05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160
Sorry, I am not uh really aware about

05:15:06.160 --> 05:15:10.948
Sorry, I am not uh really aware about magenta grouped products, but let me

05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958
magenta grouped products, but let me

05:15:10.958 --> 05:15:13.990
magenta grouped products, but let me quickly is there any product type where

05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000
quickly is there any product type where

05:15:14.000 --> 05:15:16.390
quickly is there any product type where non-variants can be a child product in

05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400
non-variants can be a child product in

05:15:16.400 --> 05:15:18.948
non-variants can be a child product in the grid view

05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958
the grid view

05:15:18.958 --> 05:15:20.788
the grid view or configurable?

05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798
or configurable?

05:15:20.798 --> 05:15:21.910
or configurable? Yeah. So

05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920
Yeah. So

05:15:21.920 --> 05:15:23.910
Yeah. So similar to how you could have a number

05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920
similar to how you could have a number

05:15:23.920 --> 05:15:27.510
similar to how you could have a number of not necessarily related SKs um like

05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520
of not necessarily related SKs um like

05:15:27.520 --> 05:15:29.110
of not necessarily related SKs um like you had in the kit

05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120
you had in the kit

05:15:29.120 --> 05:15:31.030
you had in the kit but it would show up as the grid view

05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040
but it would show up as the grid view

05:15:31.040 --> 05:15:35.270
but it would show up as the grid view where you had with configurable products

05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280
where you had with configurable products

05:15:35.280 --> 05:15:39.270
where you had with configurable products I see no so and in your and for this

05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280
I see no so and in your and for this

05:15:39.280 --> 05:15:42.708
I see no so and in your and for this case product kit will not work uh in

05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718
case product kit will not work uh in

05:15:42.718 --> 05:15:45.270
case product kit will not work uh in this case you in the question that you

05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280
this case you in the question that you

05:15:45.280 --> 05:15:46.150
this case you in the question that you listed

05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160
listed

05:15:46.160 --> 05:15:48.470
listed correct because the kit requires let's

05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480
correct because the kit requires let's

05:15:48.480 --> 05:15:50.868
correct because the kit requires let's say all three or four different types of

05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878
say all three or four different types of

05:15:50.878 --> 05:15:52.788
say all three or four different types of you know options to be added whereas

05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798
you know options to be added whereas

05:15:52.798 --> 05:15:55.110
you know options to be added whereas here I would want to give the you know

05:15:55.110 --> 05:15:55.120
here I would want to give the you know

05:15:55.120 --> 05:15:56.948
here I would want to give the you know five of this four of this none of the

05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958
five of this four of this none of the

05:15:56.958 --> 05:15:59.510
five of this four of this none of the other one something like that um in a

05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520
other one something like that um in a

05:15:59.520 --> 05:16:02.390
other one something like that um in a grid view with numbers of the the amount

05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400
grid view with numbers of the the amount

05:16:02.400 --> 05:16:06.310
grid view with numbers of the the amount of quantity to be added

05:16:06.320 --> 05:16:09.270
but um remember for the product kit we

05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280
but um remember for the product kit we

05:16:09.280 --> 05:16:12.628
but um remember for the product kit we have this uh uh we do not have this we

05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638
have this uh uh we do not have this we

05:16:12.638 --> 05:16:14.550
have this uh uh we do not have this we can specify either we would like to

05:16:14.550 --> 05:16:14.560
can specify either we would like to

05:16:14.560 --> 05:16:16.948
can specify either we would like to restrict of what quantity should be

05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958
restrict of what quantity should be

05:16:16.958 --> 05:16:19.750
restrict of what quantity should be purchased so imagine we have like a kit

05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760
purchased so imagine we have like a kit

05:16:19.760 --> 05:16:22.948
purchased so imagine we have like a kit with the list of uh with the main uh

05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958
with the list of uh with the main uh

05:16:22.958 --> 05:16:25.590
with the list of uh with the main uh with some main section uh and we are

05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600
with some main section uh and we are

05:16:25.600 --> 05:16:28.230
with some main section uh and we are listing only simple u simply listing

05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240
listing only simple u simply listing

05:16:28.240 --> 05:16:31.750
listing only simple u simply listing products and not u limiting of uh how

05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760
products and not u limiting of uh how

05:16:31.760 --> 05:16:35.270
products and not u limiting of uh how many items should be uh but you I've got

05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280
many items should be uh but you I've got

05:16:35.280 --> 05:16:39.270
many items should be uh but you I've got you you would like to yeah yeah u yeah I

05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280
you you would like to yeah yeah u yeah I

05:16:39.280 --> 05:16:43.670
you you would like to yeah yeah u yeah I recollected there is there was a some

05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680
recollected there is there was a some

05:16:43.680 --> 05:16:45.990
recollected there is there was a some talking about introducing this

05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000
talking about introducing this

05:16:46.000 --> 05:16:49.190
talking about introducing this additional type of uh products uh that

05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200
additional type of uh products uh that

05:16:49.200 --> 05:16:52.070
additional type of uh products uh that was mentioned and while introducing

05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080
was mentioned and while introducing

05:16:52.080 --> 05:16:57.190
was mentioned and while introducing product kits. Yeah, I got your idea. So,

05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200
product kits. Yeah, I got your idea. So,

05:16:57.200 --> 05:16:59.910
product kits. Yeah, I got your idea. So, right now this is not available but this

05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920
right now this is not available but this

05:16:59.920 --> 05:17:02.150
right now this is not available but this is something that was I would I will

05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160
is something that was I would I will

05:17:02.160 --> 05:17:05.830
is something that was I would I will pick up the the notes from the product

05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840
pick up the the notes from the product

05:17:05.840 --> 05:17:08.708
pick up the the notes from the product kit demonstration and it was mentioned

05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718
kit demonstration and it was mentioned

05:17:08.718 --> 05:17:12.230
kit demonstration and it was mentioned that for the next year there is a plans

05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240
that for the next year there is a plans

05:17:12.240 --> 05:17:16.310
that for the next year there is a plans to have such type of product.

05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320
to have such type of product.

05:17:16.320 --> 05:17:19.590
to have such type of product. Thank you.

05:17:19.600 --> 05:17:22.708
Um is there the next question is there

05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718
Um is there the next question is there

05:17:22.718 --> 05:17:24.868
Um is there the next question is there any advantage to using a product

05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878
any advantage to using a product

05:17:24.878 --> 05:17:28.868
any advantage to using a product attribute versus adding a product field?

05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878
attribute versus adding a product field?

05:17:28.878 --> 05:17:31.750
attribute versus adding a product field? So uh for the product field this is um

05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760
So uh for the product field this is um

05:17:31.760 --> 05:17:35.830
So uh for the product field this is um it could be treated as uh some let's say

05:17:35.830 --> 05:17:35.840
it could be treated as uh some let's say

05:17:35.840 --> 05:17:38.470
it could be treated as uh some let's say uh product property which should not be

05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480
uh product property which should not be

05:17:38.480 --> 05:17:42.230
uh product property which should not be exposed to the uh to the uh storefront.

05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240
exposed to the uh to the uh storefront.

05:17:42.240 --> 05:17:44.628
exposed to the uh to the uh storefront. I would describe it this way but just

05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638
I would describe it this way but just

05:17:44.638 --> 05:17:48.948
I would describe it this way but just some internal he for rating for for

05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958
some internal he for rating for for

05:17:48.958 --> 05:17:52.390
some internal he for rating for for internal back office usage only. While

05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400
internal back office usage only. While

05:17:52.400 --> 05:17:54.868
internal back office usage only. While if you have uh

05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878
if you have uh

05:17:54.878 --> 05:17:57.510
if you have uh something that should be exposed to the

05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520
something that should be exposed to the

05:17:57.520 --> 05:18:00.150
something that should be exposed to the storefront to make it filterable,

05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160
storefront to make it filterable,

05:18:00.160 --> 05:18:01.670
storefront to make it filterable, searchable

05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680
searchable

05:18:01.680 --> 05:18:05.670
searchable um to be visible in a storefront then

05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680
um to be visible in a storefront then

05:18:05.680 --> 05:18:10.070
um to be visible in a storefront then use attributes.

05:18:10.080 --> 05:18:14.550
attributes they contains uh more options

05:18:14.550 --> 05:18:14.560
attributes they contains uh more options

05:18:14.560 --> 05:18:25.510
attributes they contains uh more options to be uh than fields uh to be set up.

05:18:25.520 --> 05:18:27.510
Okay, so we have finished with the

05:18:27.510 --> 05:18:27.520
Okay, so we have finished with the

05:18:27.520 --> 05:18:29.030
Okay, so we have finished with the questions.

05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040
questions.

05:18:29.040 --> 05:18:30.948
questions. We are

05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958
We are

05:18:30.958 --> 05:18:34.470
We are out of time. Uh let me check one thing

05:18:34.470 --> 05:18:34.480
out of time. Uh let me check one thing

05:18:34.480 --> 05:18:37.030
out of time. Uh let me check one thing uh before we

05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040
uh before we

05:18:37.040 --> 05:18:44.070
uh before we uh disconnect.

05:18:44.080 --> 05:18:46.788
Okay. So I have an exercise but it will

05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798
Okay. So I have an exercise but it will

05:18:46.798 --> 05:18:50.390
Okay. So I have an exercise but it will be relevant for the uh when we finish

05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400
be relevant for the uh when we finish

05:18:50.400 --> 05:18:54.708
be relevant for the uh when we finish with the uh master uh catalog. Uh so

05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718
with the uh master uh catalog. Uh so

05:18:54.718 --> 05:18:58.390
with the uh master uh catalog. Uh so okay for now uh let's finish with the

05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400
okay for now uh let's finish with the

05:18:58.400 --> 05:19:03.750
okay for now uh let's finish with the day one just short summary

05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760
day one just short summary

05:19:03.760 --> 05:19:07.430
day one just short summary of these days. We've checked how website

05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440
of these days. We've checked how website

05:19:07.440 --> 05:19:10.708
of these days. We've checked how website looks like and storefront part of the

05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718
looks like and storefront part of the

05:19:10.718 --> 05:19:13.270
looks like and storefront part of the orcommerce application looks like. We

05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280
orcommerce application looks like. We

05:19:13.280 --> 05:19:15.990
orcommerce application looks like. We have checked how we can uh introduce

05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000
have checked how we can uh introduce

05:19:16.000 --> 05:19:19.590
have checked how we can uh introduce more sites, more websites and how they

05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600
more sites, more websites and how they

05:19:19.600 --> 05:19:22.788
more sites, more websites and how they could be configured. U especially that

05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798
could be configured. U especially that

05:19:22.798 --> 05:19:26.390
could be configured. U especially that part related to the um layouts and

05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400
part related to the um layouts and

05:19:26.400 --> 05:19:29.990
part related to the um layouts and themes to per to

05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000
themes to per to

05:19:30.000 --> 05:19:33.350
themes to per to uh introduce um um some specific user

05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360
uh introduce um um some specific user

05:19:33.360 --> 05:19:36.230
uh introduce um um some specific user experience. UI

05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240
experience. UI

05:19:36.240 --> 05:19:38.948
experience. UI for the end users. Then we started to

05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958
for the end users. Then we started to

05:19:38.958 --> 05:19:42.868
for the end users. Then we started to talk from those entities which are uh

05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878
talk from those entities which are uh

05:19:42.878 --> 05:19:45.510
talk from those entities which are uh which take

05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520
which take

05:19:45.520 --> 05:19:49.430
which take place in a uh purchase process and

05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440
place in a uh purchase process and

05:19:49.440 --> 05:19:52.070
place in a uh purchase process and started with a customer uh related

05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080
started with a customer uh related

05:19:52.080 --> 05:19:55.110
started with a customer uh related entities like customer customer users

05:19:55.110 --> 05:19:55.120
entities like customer customer users

05:19:55.120 --> 05:19:58.390
