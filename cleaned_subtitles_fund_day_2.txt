00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559
Orocommerce

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.750
Orocommerce Uh one thing that I was not able to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
Uh one thing that I was not able to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.310
Uh one thing that I was not able to demonstrate you how so I was actually

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320
demonstrate you how so I was actually

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.630
demonstrate you how so I was actually demonstrated using

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640
demonstrated using

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.950
demonstrated using documentation how configurable uh

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
documentation how configurable uh

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.510
documentation how configurable uh products uh could be added uh to uh to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
products uh could be added uh to uh to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.549
products uh could be added uh to uh to the cart using uh different uh forms and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
the cart using uh different uh forms and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.510
the cart using uh different uh forms and it was not working for me. Um I have

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520
it was not working for me. Um I have

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.509
it was not working for me. Um I have checked the reason and um I will

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
checked the reason and um I will

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.830
checked the reason and um I will demonstrate briefly what was wrong in my

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
demonstrate briefly what was wrong in my

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.550
demonstrate briefly what was wrong in my setup. So I had a um variance uh test

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
setup. So I had a um variance uh test

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.149
setup. So I had a um variance uh test one and test two and uh those variants

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
one and test two and uh those variants

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.109
one and test two and uh those variants were the were assigned were created with

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119
were the were assigned were created with

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.510
were the were assigned were created with the unit of quantity item. While when I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
the unit of quantity item. While when I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.910
the unit of quantity item. While when I was creating configurable product, I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
was creating configurable product, I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.149
was creating configurable product, I created configurable product with the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
created configurable product with the

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.749
created configurable product with the unit of quantity set here. uh yesterday

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759
unit of quantity set here. uh yesterday

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.670
unit of quantity set here. uh yesterday I had set unit of quantity and u because

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680
I had set unit of quantity and u because

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.630
I had set unit of quantity and u because of this uh unit of quantity not matching

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
of this uh unit of quantity not matching

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.910
of this uh unit of quantity not matching on a configurable level uh configurable

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
on a configurable level uh configurable

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.789
on a configurable level uh configurable product level and on a variance that's

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799
product level and on a variance that's

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.389
product level and on a variance that's why I was u able to see the default uh

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
why I was u able to see the default uh

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.190
why I was u able to see the default uh form for the uh for adding products to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
form for the uh for adding products to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.310
form for the uh for adding products to uh uh to the shopping list. So now I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
uh uh to the shopping list. So now I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.870
uh uh to the shopping list. So now I have pix so both varants and uh

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880
have pix so both varants and uh

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.789
have pix so both varants and uh configurable has the same unit of

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
configurable has the same unit of

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.510
configurable has the same unit of quantity item. And if I go to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
quantity item. And if I go to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.229
quantity item. And if I go to configuration and uh change for instance

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239
configuration and uh change for instance

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.550
configuration and uh change for instance both popup

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
both popup

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.030
both popup uh for the configurable for the both uh

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
uh for the configurable for the both uh

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.750
uh for the configurable for the both uh product view and product listing page.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
product view and product listing page.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.390
product view and product listing page. Now I should have pop matrix uh popup uh

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
Now I should have pop matrix uh popup uh

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.750
Now I should have pop matrix uh popup uh for the configurable. So uh let me go to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
for the configurable. So uh let me go to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.270
for the configurable. So uh let me go to the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.830
I will first search for the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.670
oops I need to log in.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.229

Previously we had those uh fields for selecting uh what kind of variance we

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360
selecting uh what kind of variance we

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.030
selecting uh what kind of variance we would like to add. Right now there is no

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
would like to add. Right now there is no

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.229

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319
and this is how inline matrix uh looks

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.470
and this is how inline matrix uh looks like uh for configuration. So again um

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
like uh for configuration. So again um

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.630
like uh for configuration. So again um need to pay attention that unit of

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640
need to pay attention that unit of

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.589
need to pay attention that unit of quantity fits on both variance and u

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599
quantity fits on both variance and u

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.070
quantity fits on both variance and u configurable product that they are the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080
configurable product that they are the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.589
configurable product that they are the same otherwise uh this form will be just

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599
same otherwise uh this form will be just

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.910
same otherwise uh this form will be just provided a default one but not the one

okay then let's start let's continue

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.950
okay then let's start let's continue with the uh with the day two and for day

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960
with the uh with the day two and for day

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.230
with the uh with the day two and for day two we have u

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240
two we have u

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.469
two we have u master catalog

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479
master catalog

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.110
master catalog and web catalog we'll see what's the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120
and web catalog we'll see what's the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.230
and web catalog we'll see what's the difference with it how to set them up uh

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240
difference with it how to set them up uh

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.390
difference with it how to set them up uh then we will switch to pricing how

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400
then we will switch to pricing how

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.350
then we will switch to pricing how pricing agent works what kind of of what

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
pricing agent works what kind of of what

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.430
pricing agent works what kind of of what kind of components it um u it consists

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440
kind of components it um u it consists

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.469
kind of components it um u it consists of how prices are calculated depending

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479
of how prices are calculated depending

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.710
of how prices are calculated depending on different strategy and then uh at the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720
on different strategy and then uh at the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.830
on different strategy and then uh at the very end of the day two we will cover

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840
very end of the day two we will cover

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.110
very end of the day two we will cover also price related topics and these are

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
also price related topics and these are

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.230
also price related topics and these are promotions and discounts.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240
promotions and discounts.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.430
promotions and discounts. Uh so let's uh start with the master

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440
Uh so let's uh start with the master

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.510
Uh so let's uh start with the master catalog.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
catalog.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.310
catalog. Uh so we have products uh in our system

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320
Uh so we have products uh in our system

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.790
Uh so we have products uh in our system in a back office. Now the question is

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800
in a back office. Now the question is

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.550
in a back office. Now the question is how to categorize them and uh the way

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560
how to categorize them and uh the way

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.390
how to categorize them and uh the way products are categorized in orcommerce

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400
products are categorized in orcommerce

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.230
products are categorized in orcommerce is u using master catalog. So it

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240
is u using master catalog. So it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.590
is u using master catalog. So it actually represents a tree of u uh

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600
actually represents a tree of u uh

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.310
actually represents a tree of u uh categories which contains of like a root

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320
categories which contains of like a root

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.710
categories which contains of like a root um some root u uh node uh and then some

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720
um some root u uh node uh and then some

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.629
um some root u uh node uh and then some uh sub subcategories. One second. Let me

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639
uh sub subcategories. One second. Let me

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.469
uh sub subcategories. One second. Let me admit

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479
admit

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.350
admit someone is joining. Uh and also uh yeah

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360
someone is joining. Uh and also uh yeah

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.909
someone is joining. Uh and also uh yeah the the root category and then some

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919
the the root category and then some

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.710
the the root category and then some subcategories and we this way we will

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720
subcategories and we this way we will

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.629
subcategories and we this way we will have some kind of tree with the parent

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639
have some kind of tree with the parent

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.950
have some kind of tree with the parent and child categories.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960
and child categories.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.430
and child categories. Uh each uh category uh of master uh

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440
Uh each uh category uh of master uh

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.029
Uh each uh category uh of master uh catalog. It has its own properties and

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039
catalog. It has its own properties and

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.909
catalog. It has its own properties and we can configure

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919
we can configure

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.110
we can configure uh different u settings related to uh

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
uh different u settings related to uh

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.830
uh different u settings related to uh how uh

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840
how uh

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.150
how uh product option should look like what

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160
product option should look like what

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.550
product option should look like what kind of visibility of the uh category uh

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560
kind of visibility of the uh category uh

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.350
kind of visibility of the uh category uh to what uh customer customer groups or

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360
to what uh customer customer groups or

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.629
to what uh customer customer groups or websites uh expose this category or not

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639
websites uh expose this category or not

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.430
websites uh expose this category or not and also search engine optimization uh

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440
and also search engine optimization uh

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.029
and also search engine optimization uh options

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039
options

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.870
options and Master catalog could be used uh not

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880
and Master catalog could be used uh not

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.629
and Master catalog could be used uh not only for categorizing products

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639
only for categorizing products

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.070
only for categorizing products in in our back office but also for uh

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080
in in our back office but also for uh

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.469
in in our back office but also for uh using it as a uh source of the uh

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
using it as a uh source of the uh

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.270
using it as a uh source of the uh navigation main navigation menu. Uh

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280
navigation main navigation menu. Uh

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.950
navigation main navigation menu. Uh master catalog is uh built using uh this

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960
master catalog is uh built using uh this

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.550
master catalog is uh built using uh this gadmo uh nested uh tree. So based on the

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560
gadmo uh nested uh tree. So based on the

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.469
gadmo uh nested uh tree. So based on the the screen extension um you may check

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479
the screen extension um you may check

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.670
the screen extension um you may check the documentation how

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680
the documentation how

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.710
the documentation how um how especially the nested uh tree uh

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720
um how especially the nested uh tree uh

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.870
um how especially the nested uh tree uh extension works but uh yeah it was uh

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880
extension works but uh yeah it was uh

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.270
extension works but uh yeah it was uh built aura uses it and on top uh

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280
built aura uses it and on top uh

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.589
built aura uses it and on top uh introduces its own logic and actually

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599
introduces its own logic and actually

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.029
introduces its own logic and actually the entity which is responsible for uh

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039
the entity which is responsible for uh

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.990
the entity which is responsible for uh storing categories of master catalog is

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000
storing categories of master catalog is

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.830
storing categories of master catalog is the uh this one which is listed here

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840
the uh this one which is listed here

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.510
the uh this one which is listed here category under or catalog bundle. So now

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520
category under or catalog bundle. So now

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.749
category under or catalog bundle. So now let's switch uh to the demonstration and

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759
let's switch uh to the demonstration and

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.189
let's switch uh to the demonstration and uh

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.189
okay yeah let's switch to the

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199
okay yeah let's switch to the

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.430
okay yeah let's switch to the demonstration.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
demonstration.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.629
demonstration. So I will close these things

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639
So I will close these things

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.550
So I will close these things and uh so master catalog it is uh

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560
and uh so master catalog it is uh

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.830
and uh so master catalog it is uh located under products uh master catalog

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840
located under products uh master catalog

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.710
located under products uh master catalog in a back office. So uh there is an

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720
in a back office. So uh there is an

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.309
in a back office. So uh there is an ability to have only single uh master

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319
ability to have only single uh master

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:12.950
ability to have only single uh master catalog in the uh in back office uh and

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960
catalog in the uh in back office uh and

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.510
catalog in the uh in back office uh and each uh so we have a master catalog and

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520
each uh so we have a master catalog and

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.749
each uh so we have a master catalog and we have a list of categories. We have a

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759
we have a list of categories. We have a

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.869
we have a list of categories. We have a root category called all products and

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879
root category called all products and

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.189
root category called all products and then we have some subcategories like

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199
then we have some subcategories like

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:27.270
then we have some subcategories like lightning products, medical uh and and

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280
lightning products, medical uh and and

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.110
lightning products, medical uh and and other stuff.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120
other stuff.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.990
other stuff. So if we pick up one of the categories

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
So if we pick up one of the categories

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.709
So if we pick up one of the categories uh we have like here lightning products

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719
uh we have like here lightning products

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:37.190
uh we have like here lightning products uh we see some uh general information of

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200
uh we see some uh general information of

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.350
uh we see some uh general information of the category it contains some

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360
the category it contains some

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.389
the category it contains some subcategories um uh architectural and

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399
subcategories um uh architectural and

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.909
subcategories um uh architectural and headlamps.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919
headlamps.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.470
headlamps. uh each category uh has u information

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480
uh each category uh has u information

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.430
uh each category uh has u information about uh like short description uh long

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440
about uh like short description uh long

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.230
about uh like short description uh long description of the uh category which

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240
description of the uh category which

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.949
description of the uh category which will be visible then in a storefront. By

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959
will be visible then in a storefront. By

00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:00.310
will be visible then in a storefront. By the way, this also like uses those

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320
the way, this also like uses those

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.389
the way, this also like uses those localizable values that we were talking

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399
localizable values that we were talking

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.790
localizable values that we were talking about uh during product describing

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800
about uh during product describing

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.630
about uh during product describing product

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640
product

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.070
product uh product fields and product

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080
uh product fields and product

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.829
uh product fields and product attributes. So we can specify depending

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839
attributes. So we can specify depending

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.790
attributes. So we can specify depending on a uh localization

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800
on a uh localization

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.230
on a uh localization and uh so we are able to assign uh

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240
and uh so we are able to assign uh

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.790
and uh so we are able to assign uh while creating a category uh to assign

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800
while creating a category uh to assign

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.110
while creating a category uh to assign what kind of products uh belong to the

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120
what kind of products uh belong to the

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.750
what kind of products uh belong to the category they could be assigned uh here

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760
category they could be assigned uh here

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.870
category they could be assigned uh here from the category or uh whenever we are

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880
from the category or uh whenever we are

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.470
from the category or uh whenever we are creating a product uh uh using product

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480
creating a product uh uh using product

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.710
creating a product uh uh using product uh uh create page to here

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720
uh uh create page to here

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.190
uh uh create page to here we have the ability to to specify to

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200
we have the ability to to specify to

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.630
we have the ability to to specify to what uh category our newly created

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640
what uh category our newly created

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.030
what uh category our newly created product will be wrong. Or we can create

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040
product will be wrong. Or we can create

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.910
product will be wrong. Or we can create without assigning but then reassign uh

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920
without assigning but then reassign uh

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.670
without assigning but then reassign uh using

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680
using

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.030
using uh using this form or using this data

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040
uh using this form or using this data

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.030
uh using this form or using this data grid.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040
grid.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.710
grid. Uh we have uh some product uh uh options

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720
Uh we have uh some product uh uh options

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.910
Uh we have uh some product uh uh options um which are which will be common uh for

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920
um which are which will be common uh for

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.710
um which are which will be common uh for the whole category. So all products

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720
the whole category. So all products

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.910
the whole category. So all products within the uh same category will own

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920
within the uh same category will own

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.350
within the uh same category will own this uh this options. Uh these are

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360
this uh this options. Uh these are

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.710
this uh this options. Uh these are options related to inventory setup and

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720
options related to inventory setup and

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.030
options related to inventory setup and we will have a separate topic related to

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
we will have a separate topic related to

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.949
we will have a separate topic related to inventory and we will go over uh this um

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959
inventory and we will go over uh this um

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:26.550
inventory and we will go over uh this um settings there.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560
settings there.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.710
settings there. This is related to CRM uh feature

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720
This is related to CRM uh feature

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.110
This is related to CRM uh feature tracking some activities. Uh let's not

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120
tracking some activities. Uh let's not

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.190
tracking some activities. Uh let's not focus on it. But the main thing I wanted

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200
focus on it. But the main thing I wanted

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.150
focus on it. But the main thing I wanted to demonstrate is uh that we are able to

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160
to demonstrate is uh that we are able to

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.990
to demonstrate is uh that we are able to set up uh visibility of the categories.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000
set up uh visibility of the categories.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.630
set up uh visibility of the categories. Um and we may see that we have the

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640
Um and we may see that we have the

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.630
Um and we may see that we have the ability to set up visibility depending

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640
ability to set up visibility depending

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.790
ability to set up visibility depending on the

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800
on the

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.670
on the uh on the

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680
uh on the

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.150
uh on the on different levels. uh and with u

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160
on different levels. uh and with u

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.550
on different levels. uh and with u ability to have

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560
ability to have

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.750
ability to have uh not only like levels here for the uh

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760
uh not only like levels here for the uh

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.470
uh not only like levels here for the uh customer for the customer group and for

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480
customer for the customer group and for

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.030
customer for the customer group and for the all uh but also uh depending on the

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040
the all uh but also uh depending on the

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.430
the all uh but also uh depending on the callbacks. So in this certain case we

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440
callbacks. So in this certain case we

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.389
callbacks. So in this certain case we have a uh uh lightning products

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399
have a uh uh lightning products

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.750
have a uh uh lightning products category. We can specify um to have it

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760
category. We can specify um to have it

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.470
category. We can specify um to have it to be it visible for some specific uh

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480
to be it visible for some specific uh

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.630
to be it visible for some specific uh for all uh to be to be specific either

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640
for all uh to be to be specific either

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.150
for all uh to be to be specific either visible or hidden or we can use as a

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160
visible or hidden or we can use as a

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.350
visible or hidden or we can use as a fallback and inherit visibility from the

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360
fallback and inherit visibility from the

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.030
fallback and inherit visibility from the parent category which is all products.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040
parent category which is all products.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.750
parent category which is all products. And uh or we can set visibility to be

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760
And uh or we can set visibility to be

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.509
And uh or we can set visibility to be provided uh the one that is in a global

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519
provided uh the one that is in a global

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:42.630
provided uh the one that is in a global configuration level. And similar to this

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640
configuration level. And similar to this

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.590
configuration level. And similar to this we let's pick up uh visibility per

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600
we let's pick up uh visibility per

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.550
we let's pick up uh visibility per customer. So we can define whether we

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560
customer. So we can define whether we

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.949
customer. So we can define whether we would like to

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959
would like to

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:53.590
would like to uh to limit access uh for the lightning

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600
uh to limit access uh for the lightning

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.269
uh to limit access uh for the lightning products for certain uh customer for

00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279
products for certain uh customer for

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.670
products for certain uh customer for instance customer A. And here we also

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680
instance customer A. And here we also

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.389
instance customer A. And here we also have uh settings to to set the

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399
have uh settings to to set the

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.150
have uh settings to to set the visibility level or

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160
visibility level or

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.269
visibility level or visibility settings to be some kind of

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279
visibility settings to be some kind of

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.150
visibility settings to be some kind of explicit either hidden or visible

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160
explicit either hidden or visible

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.030
explicit either hidden or visible inherit from the parent category uh

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040
inherit from the parent category uh

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.790
inherit from the parent category uh inherit from the visible all or inherit

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800
inherit from the visible all or inherit

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.790
inherit from the visible all or inherit from the uh customer group uh visibility

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800
from the uh customer group uh visibility

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.990
from the uh customer group uh visibility which is this one. So we have like

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000
which is this one. So we have like

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.150
which is this one. So we have like several layers where this could be

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160
several layers where this could be

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.110
several layers where this could be configured and depending on uh the

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120
configured and depending on uh the

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.870
configured and depending on uh the requirements we can have this visibility

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880
requirements we can have this visibility

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.030
requirements we can have this visibility set up. And the last section uh here

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040
set up. And the last section uh here

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.949
set up. And the last section uh here while creating a categories for the

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959
while creating a categories for the

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.030
while creating a categories for the for the master catalog we have the

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040
for the master catalog we have the

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.069
for the master catalog we have the search engine optimization options

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079
search engine optimization options

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:53.110
search engine optimization options uh which uh allows us to provide

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120
uh which uh allows us to provide

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.310
uh which uh allows us to provide additional matter pills to the category

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320
additional matter pills to the category

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.069
additional matter pills to the category uh page and uh yeah for them

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079
uh page and uh yeah for them

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:06.629
uh page and uh yeah for them they would be then um scanned by their

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639
they would be then um scanned by their

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:10.949
they would be then um scanned by their indexation bots and u store it on um

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959
indexation bots and u store it on um

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.310
indexation bots and u store it on um that search engines.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320
that search engines.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.829
that search engines. Uh let's uh let's let's let's let's

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839
Uh let's uh let's let's let's let's

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.670
Uh let's uh let's let's let's let's demonstrate how it works. And let me

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680
demonstrate how it works. And let me

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.350
demonstrate how it works. And let me turn back to the slides. And the first

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360
turn back to the slides. And the first

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.870
turn back to the slides. And the first uh we have is um this uh category u

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880
uh we have is um this uh category u

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.310
uh we have is um this uh category u search engine optimization fields. Uh

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320
search engine optimization fields. Uh

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.949
search engine optimization fields. Uh okay. So, let's pick up one of the

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959
okay. So, let's pick up one of the

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.509
okay. So, let's pick up one of the headlamps

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519
headlamps

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:46.310
headlamps and check how it works.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.910
Um, so I have uh headlamps. Let's go to

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920
Um, so I have uh headlamps. Let's go to

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.750
Um, so I have uh headlamps. Let's go to this category here in uh

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:54.760
this category here in uh

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.430
this category here in uh [Music]

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440
[Music]

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.430
[Music] so it displays uh uh the products which

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440
so it displays uh uh the products which

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.230
so it displays uh uh the products which are assigned to the headlamps.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240
are assigned to the headlamps.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.430
are assigned to the headlamps. uh category.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440
uh category.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.069
uh category. So using the URL of the category, I was

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079
So using the URL of the category, I was

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:12.150
So using the URL of the category, I was able to navigate it. But we can navigate

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160
able to navigate it. But we can navigate

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.430
able to navigate it. But we can navigate it using navigation menu, we will check

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440
it using navigation menu, we will check

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.509
it using navigation menu, we will check uh how to set it up. Right now let's

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519
uh how to set it up. Right now let's

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.269
uh how to set it up. Right now let's focus on the category. We have a

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279
focus on the category. We have a

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:22.150
focus on the category. We have a category in a back office which has some

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160
category in a back office which has some

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.069
category in a back office which has some uh description

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079
uh description

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.230
uh description uh long description, short description

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240
uh long description, short description

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.189
uh long description, short description which is listed here. We have the title

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199
which is listed here. We have the title

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.110
which is listed here. We have the title of the category which is listed here. We

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120
of the category which is listed here. We

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.870
of the category which is listed here. We have um products which are assigned. We

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
have um products which are assigned. We

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.590
have um products which are assigned. We have three products and um all three of

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600
have three products and um all three of

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.829
have three products and um all three of them are listed here. You can specify

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839
them are listed here. You can specify

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.430
them are listed here. You can specify the order in which you would like the uh

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440
the order in which you would like the uh

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.670
the order in which you would like the uh products to be presented on a category.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680
products to be presented on a category.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.269
products to be presented on a category. So changing the order. Let's put it 70.

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279
So changing the order. Let's put it 70.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:55.350
So changing the order. Let's put it 70. I will update. So product industrial uh

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360
I will update. So product industrial uh

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.870
I will update. So product industrial uh 310

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880
310

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.069
310 uh should be at the very bottom of

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079
uh should be at the very bottom of

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:10.710
uh should be at the very bottom of category. So if I refresh the page uh

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.310
but need to have run consumers

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320
but need to have run consumers

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.629
but need to have run consumers for the

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639
for the

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:21.829
for the uh data to be uh put to uh index.

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839
uh data to be uh put to uh index.

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.990
uh data to be uh put to uh index. Okay. So I have changed the order and it

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000
Okay. So I have changed the order and it

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.590
Okay. So I have changed the order and it is reflected in the uh category. So

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600
is reflected in the uh category. So

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.910
is reflected in the uh category. So product industrial 310 was put to the

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920
product industrial 310 was put to the

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.430
product industrial 310 was put to the bottom as it's uh sort order is uh the

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
bottom as it's uh sort order is uh the

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.189
bottom as it's uh sort order is uh the the highest one.

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:44.389
Um

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.470
so we have this search engine

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480
so we have this search engine

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.990
so we have this search engine optimization uh options and I have

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000
optimization uh options and I have

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.710
optimization uh options and I have specified some headlamps meta title

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720
specified some headlamps meta title

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.110
specified some headlamps meta title headlamps meta description and all of

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120
headlamps meta description and all of

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.870
headlamps meta description and all of them

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880
them

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.150
them are then populated to the page uh when

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160
are then populated to the page uh when

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.910
are then populated to the page uh when the page is uh prepared and rendered. So

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920
the page is uh prepared and rendered. So

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.590
the page is uh prepared and rendered. So if I open uh

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600
if I open uh

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.350
if I open uh console and search for the

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360
console and search for the

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.430
console and search for the uh for one of the values. So here are

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440
uh for one of the values. So here are

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.350
uh for one of the values. So here are those meta title, description and

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360
those meta title, description and

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.990
those meta title, description and keywords and all of them were uh

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
keywords and all of them were uh

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.230
keywords and all of them were uh provided from the category u search uh

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240
provided from the category u search uh

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:32.629
provided from the category u search uh engine optimization options.

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:35.509
Okay, now let me demonstrate how

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519
Okay, now let me demonstrate how

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.470
Okay, now let me demonstrate how visibility works. Um

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480
visibility works. Um

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.310
visibility works. Um uh for example, let's pick up uh

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320
uh for example, let's pick up uh

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.389
uh for example, let's pick up uh company A um

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:52.470
company A and uh make uh for company A

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480
company A and uh make uh for company A

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.550
company A and uh make uh for company A uh this headlamps category hidden. Okay,

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560
uh this headlamps category hidden. Okay,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.069
uh this headlamps category hidden. Okay, I have saved the changes.

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079
I have saved the changes.

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:04.949
I have saved the changes. The consumers have processed.

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:09.590
So now let me also pick up the product.

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600
So now let me also pick up the product.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.390
So now let me also pick up the product. Uh now I am logged in as a company A

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400
Uh now I am logged in as a company A

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.270
Uh now I am logged in as a company A customer user. I have uh set this

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280
customer user. I have uh set this

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.750
customer user. I have uh set this category especially headlamps to be

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760
category especially headlamps to be

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.630
category especially headlamps to be hidden for the company A. Now if I

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640
hidden for the company A. Now if I

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.909

while talking about um search engine

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.110
while talking about um search engine optimization, those fields uh so I have

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120
optimization, those fields uh so I have

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.270
optimization, those fields uh so I have demonstrated that they are populated uh

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280
demonstrated that they are populated uh

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.830
demonstrated that they are populated uh on a category page when the cate

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840
on a category page when the cate

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.789
on a category page when the cate category page is u u is rendered. Um

by uh this uh value, I should also be able

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440
uh this uh value, I should also be able

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.070
uh this uh value, I should also be able to to find uh

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080
to to find uh

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.470
to to find uh you see to find this category or

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480
you see to find this category or

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.710
you see to find this category or products of this category in a search

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720
products of this category in a search

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.190
products of this category in a search results. Um and the way it is done, it

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200
results. Um and the way it is done, it

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.510
results. Um and the way it is done, it is done using this uh um like listeners

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520
is done using this uh um like listeners

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.470
is done using this uh um like listeners which are responsible for indexing uh

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480
which are responsible for indexing uh

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.990
which are responsible for indexing uh data.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000
data.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.510
data. uh

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520
uh

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.990
uh and this is so actually the logic which

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000
and this is so actually the logic which

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.950
and this is so actually the logic which is uh responsible for adding that data

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960
is uh responsible for adding that data

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.350
is uh responsible for adding that data to the index data from uh category uh

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360
to the index data from uh category uh

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.390
to the index data from uh category uh search engine optimization fields.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.990
And uh the last field uh the last thing

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000
And uh the last field uh the last thing

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.070
And uh the last field uh the last thing uh related to search engine optimization

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080
uh related to search engine optimization

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.110
uh related to search engine optimization is that uh uh actually not only category

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120
is that uh uh actually not only category

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.549
is that uh uh actually not only category uh field uh category entity uh has this

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559
uh field uh category entity uh has this

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:44.149
uh field uh category entity uh has this uh fields but also other pages uh uh or

00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159
uh fields but also other pages uh uh or

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:47.590
uh fields but also other pages uh uh or other entities are extended with this u

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600
other entities are extended with this u

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.669
other entities are extended with this u u meta information fields. And here we

00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679
u meta information fields. And here we

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:54.230
u meta information fields. And here we have like a list of them like product uh

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240
have like a list of them like product uh

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.630
have like a list of them like product uh also has um this u uh this fields. So

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640
also has um this u uh this fields. So

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.990
also has um this u uh this fields. So this is the migration which is

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000
this is the migration which is

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.990
this is the migration which is responsible for adding um uh search

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000
responsible for adding um uh search

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.710
responsible for adding um uh search engine optimization fields to the um the

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720
engine optimization fields to the um the

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.590
engine optimization fields to the um the entities and we do see that it is added

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600
entities and we do see that it is added

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.990
entities and we do see that it is added to the product to the landing page pages

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000
to the product to the landing page pages

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.750
to the product to the landing page pages uh web catalog and brand uh brand

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760
uh web catalog and brand uh brand

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.470
uh web catalog and brand uh brand entity. So let me go quickly. So if we

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480
entity. So let me go quickly. So if we

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.270
entity. So let me go quickly. So if we are pick up product as an example,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280
are pick up product as an example,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:37.029
are pick up product as an example, it will also have this

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:41.669
uh this fields uh

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:45.990
see our fields uh here they are uh for

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000
see our fields uh here they are uh for

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.350
see our fields uh here they are uh for the for the product. So

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360

the product the one we were just

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:40.630
the product the one we were just configuring uh this um lumen uh headlamp

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640

it was uh made him for the u company. So if I uh sign out

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.070
if I sign out and return back to the

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080
if I sign out and return back to the

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.389
if I sign out and return back to the same

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399
same

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.350
same um category we were checking so product

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360
um category we were checking so product

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.950
um category we were checking so product still exists uh still visible uh because

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960
still exists uh still visible uh because

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.909
still exists uh still visible uh because it was not made as hidden. It was not

00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919
it was not made as hidden. It was not

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:21.190
it was not made as hidden. It was not made hidden only for company A customer.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200
made hidden only for company A customer.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.830
made hidden only for company A customer. And by the way, it yeah, it is visible

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840
And by the way, it yeah, it is visible

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:32.070
And by the way, it yeah, it is visible in the search results as well.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.350
Okay, let's continue.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360
Okay, let's continue.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.310
Okay, let's continue. Uh so talking about visibility so I have

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320
Uh so talking about visibility so I have

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.590
Uh so talking about visibility so I have demonstrated how that could be uh

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600
demonstrated how that could be uh

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.389
demonstrated how that could be uh configured on a category level depending

00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399
configured on a category level depending

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:47.669
configured on a category level depending on different uh levels uh customer

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679
on different uh levels uh customer

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.149
on different uh levels uh customer customer group on a product level again

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159
customer group on a product level again

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:53.909
customer group on a product level again using customer group and website plus we

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919
using customer group and website plus we

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:57.269
using customer group and website plus we also have the visibility settings for

00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279
also have the visibility settings for

00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:59.909
also have the visibility settings for the products on a global configuration

00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919
the products on a global configuration

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:01.909
the products on a global configuration level

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919
level

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:23.029
level uh system configuration.

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:25.029
Okay. the system configuration and we

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039
Okay. the system configuration and we

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:28.630
Okay. the system configuration and we have visibility

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.909
and actually it has only two options uh

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919
and actually it has only two options uh

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:36.789
and actually it has only two options uh to set uh by default uh what uh whether

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799
to set uh by default uh what uh whether

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:39.669
to set uh by default uh what uh whether products or categories should be visible

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679
products or categories should be visible

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:42.230
products or categories should be visible or hidden and this is the option from

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240
or hidden and this is the option from

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.350
or hidden and this is the option from which uh u

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360
which uh u

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.750
which uh u visibility settings inhabit on a

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760
visibility settings inhabit on a

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.430
visibility settings inhabit on a category level and on a product level.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440
category level and on a product level.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.789
category level and on a product level. So in some cases you may want to have

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799
So in some cases you may want to have

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:59.509
So in some cases you may want to have all products uh hidden by default uh or

00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519
all products uh hidden by default uh or

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:01.669
all products uh hidden by default uh or all categories hidden by default but

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679
all categories hidden by default but

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:05.430
all categories hidden by default but then only expose uh those products which

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440
then only expose uh those products which

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.509
then only expose uh those products which uh for certain uh companies for certain

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519
uh for certain uh companies for certain

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:13.669
uh for certain uh companies for certain customer groups uh and set them visible

00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679
customer groups uh and set them visible

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:15.990
customer groups uh and set them visible only specific ones. So it depends on

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000
only specific ones. So it depends on

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.509
only specific ones. So it depends on your

00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519
your

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:20.470
your uh requirements

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480
uh requirements

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.110
uh requirements and whenever you are uh performing any

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120
and whenever you are uh performing any

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.710
and whenever you are uh performing any change uh on visibility

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720
change uh on visibility

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.230
change uh on visibility keep in mind that uh this visibility uh

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240
keep in mind that uh this visibility uh

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.509
keep in mind that uh this visibility uh requires then to be uh the change that

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519
requires then to be uh the change that

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:37.110
requires then to be uh the change that you have uh performed it needs to be uh

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120
you have uh performed it needs to be uh

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.710
you have uh performed it needs to be uh recalculated and so-called resolved uh

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720
recalculated and so-called resolved uh

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.669

depending on the fallbacks uh which were

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.110
depending on the fallbacks uh which were set up and uh here we have uh some uh

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120
set up and uh here we have uh some uh

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.630
set up and uh here we have uh some uh description

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640
description

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.190
description uh under which uh conditions um under

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200
uh under which uh conditions um under

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.310
uh under which uh conditions um under which actions operations this u

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320
which actions operations this u

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.590
which actions operations this u visibility settings uh uh recalculated

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600
visibility settings uh uh recalculated

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.549
visibility settings uh uh recalculated result value is prepared and how these

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559
result value is prepared and how these

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:23.909
result value is prepared and how these values are calculated depending on uh

00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919
values are calculated depending on uh

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:27.909
values are calculated depending on uh fallbacks.

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:31.269
U so in some cases uh yeah there is

00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279
U so in some cases uh yeah there is

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:34.710
U so in some cases uh yeah there is cases that u I have faced with that u

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720
cases that u I have faced with that u

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.350
cases that u I have faced with that u these levels that are already exist are

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360
these levels that are already exist are

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.029
these levels that are already exist are not enough and u clients were

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039
not enough and u clients were

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.269
not enough and u clients were introducing another level for for those

00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279
introducing another level for for those

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:46.149
introducing another level for for those visibility settings but then need to

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159
visibility settings but then need to

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:50.310
visibility settings but then need to have them working uh while calculating

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320
have them working uh while calculating

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.789
have them working uh while calculating final visibility uh values per product

00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799
final visibility uh values per product

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:58.870
final visibility uh values per product or per category.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.870
and order visibility bundle. This is the

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880
and order visibility bundle. This is the

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.509
and order visibility bundle. This is the one you would need to pick up while

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519
one you would need to pick up while

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:06.230
one you would need to pick up while introducing any

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240
introducing any

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.629
introducing any customization in this direction.

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639
customization in this direction.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.310
customization in this direction. So whenever we are

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320
So whenever we are

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.750
So whenever we are uh having a category uh with some

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760
uh having a category uh with some

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.470
uh having a category uh with some products assigned for those products to

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480
products assigned for those products to

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.829
products assigned for those products to be visible in a storefront and to be

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839
be visible in a storefront and to be

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:27.990
be visible in a storefront and to be provided as a search results or uh as a

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000
provided as a search results or uh as a

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.950
provided as a search results or uh as a uh category listing page. Those products

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960
uh category listing page. Those products

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.510
uh category listing page. Those products need to be put uh to the web search uh

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520
need to be put uh to the web search uh

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.470
need to be put uh to the web search uh index. Sometimes it is mentioned at the

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480
index. Sometimes it is mentioned at the

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.710
index. Sometimes it is mentioned at the storefront index or front end index and

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720
storefront index or front end index and

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:50.629
storefront index or front end index and it allows you so to to then to search uh

00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639
it allows you so to to then to search uh

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.190
it allows you so to to then to search uh your uh products in more convenient uh

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200
your uh products in more convenient uh

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.550
your uh products in more convenient uh in more convenient way depending on um

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560
in more convenient way depending on um

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.870
in more convenient way depending on um some typos that might you might u u have

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880
some typos that might you might u u have

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.430
some typos that might you might u u have uh entered in a in a search field. uh so

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440
uh entered in a in a search field. uh so

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.150
uh entered in a in a search field. uh so the data that is stored uh in index it

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160
the data that is stored uh in index it

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.550
the data that is stored uh in index it is stored uh per uh the website that you

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560
is stored uh per uh the website that you

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.310
is stored uh per uh the website that you have so imagine if you have like seven

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320
have so imagine if you have like seven

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.910
have so imagine if you have like seven websites like Australia, Canadian or

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920
websites like Australia, Canadian or

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.710
websites like Australia, Canadian or German as we have in with the

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720
German as we have in with the

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.950
German as we have in with the demonstration that data it will means

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960
demonstration that data it will means

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.750
demonstration that data it will means that you will have a separate indexes

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760
that you will have a separate indexes

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.470
that you will have a separate indexes for each individual website and under

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480
for each individual website and under

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.349
for each individual website and under those website you will have a data uh

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359
those website you will have a data uh

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:37.670
those website you will have a data uh per each uh product which is uh which

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680
per each uh product which is uh which

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.630
per each uh product which is uh which belongs to the website and out of the

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640
belongs to the website and out of the

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.870
belongs to the website and out of the box we have u u entities um which are

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880
box we have u u entities um which are

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.990
box we have u u entities um which are exposed to the uh search index. This is

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000
exposed to the uh search index. This is

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.510
exposed to the uh search index. This is product entity and brand entity. Uh but

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520
product entity and brand entity. Uh but

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.790
product entity and brand entity. Uh but uh you can extend and uh expose other

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800
uh you can extend and uh expose other

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:03.030
uh you can extend and uh expose other entities if there is a need. Uh while uh

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040
entities if there is a need. Uh while uh

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.589
entities if there is a need. Uh while uh the change is performed uh the

00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599
the change is performed uh the

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:10.870
the change is performed uh the indexation uh is uh processed u

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880
indexation uh is uh processed u

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.150
indexation uh is uh processed u asynchronously. So using uh message

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160
asynchronously. So using uh message

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.190
asynchronously. So using uh message consumer job. Uh this is the one we I've

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200
consumer job. Uh this is the one we I've

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.430
consumer job. Uh this is the one we I've just I was uh checking here. Uh so

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440
just I was uh checking here. Uh so

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.390
just I was uh checking here. Uh so anytime there is um a change in a

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400
anytime there is um a change in a

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.030
anytime there is um a change in a product or in a visibility settings

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040
product or in a visibility settings

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.910
product or in a visibility settings consumer uh reindex uh the product and

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920
consumer uh reindex uh the product and

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.950
consumer uh reindex uh the product and stores actual um uh values of the

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960
stores actual um uh values of the

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.190
stores actual um uh values of the product in the index and it could be

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200
product in the index and it could be

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.150
product in the index and it could be performed as in the background or if

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160
performed as in the background or if

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.550
performed as in the background or if there is a need there is a comments and

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560
there is a need there is a comments and

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.349
there is a need there is a comments and you can run them uh manually from a

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359
you can run them uh manually from a

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:48.470
you can run them uh manually from a common line interface and reindex either

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480
common line interface and reindex either

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.470
common line interface and reindex either some specific products uh or um using

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480
some specific products uh or um using

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.589
some specific products uh or um using uh depending on all the products for the

00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599
uh depending on all the products for the

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:59.270
uh depending on all the products for the website or for the customer for the

00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280
website or for the customer for the

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.190
website or for the customer for the customer group and the way uh how engine

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200
customer group and the way uh how engine

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.670
customer group and the way uh how engine uh collects the data to be put in the

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680
uh collects the data to be put in the

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.390
uh collects the data to be put in the index uh it uses event uh listener

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400
index uh it uses event uh listener

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.109
index uh it uses event uh listener uh approach. So whenever

00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119
uh approach. So whenever

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:18.950
uh approach. So whenever um so this is the index data provider uh

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960
um so this is the index data provider uh

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.950
um so this is the index data provider uh so whenever we are uh having u like a

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960
so whenever we are uh having u like a

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.630
so whenever we are uh having u like a product entity u and manipulating with

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640
product entity u and manipulating with

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.230
product entity u and manipulating with uh performing some changes with it then

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240
uh performing some changes with it then

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.390
uh performing some changes with it then u we have like an event which is

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400
u we have like an event which is

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.750
u we have like an event which is dispatched uh uh with the entity uh data

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760
dispatched uh uh with the entity uh data

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.150
dispatched uh uh with the entity uh data there um if you would like to put

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160
there um if you would like to put

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.550
there um if you would like to put additional data to be indexed. Uh you

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560
additional data to be indexed. Uh you

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.870
additional data to be indexed. Uh you would need to uh introduce a listener

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880
would need to uh introduce a listener

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.069
would need to uh introduce a listener which will listen to this event and add

00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079
which will listen to this event and add

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:50.710
which will listen to this event and add additional information you would like to

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720
additional information you would like to

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.310
additional information you would like to uh to be stored in the index and uh the

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320
uh to be stored in the index and uh the

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.670
uh to be stored in the index and uh the listener the example of listener which

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680
listener the example of listener which

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.710
listener the example of listener which uh uh actually one of the uh listeners

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720
uh uh actually one of the uh listeners

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.230
uh uh actually one of the uh listeners that's something you will be probably

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240
that's something you will be probably

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.310
that's something you will be probably using uh doing in a in your

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320
using uh doing in a in your

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.630
using uh doing in a in your customization.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640
customization.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.150
customization. Uh so yeah it simply listens to day one

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160
Uh so yeah it simply listens to day one

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.349
Uh so yeah it simply listens to day one uh which was demonstrated before and

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359
uh which was demonstrated before and

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.990
uh which was demonstrated before and using this method prepopulates maybe

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000
using this method prepopulates maybe

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.230
using this method prepopulates maybe prepares and then populates additional

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240
prepares and then populates additional

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.030
prepares and then populates additional data to the uh to the

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040
data to the uh to the

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.790
data to the uh to the uh

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800
uh

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.069
uh to the index. And we have uh for the

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079
to the index. And we have uh for the

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:35.589
to the index. And we have uh for the index to be aware of the fields uh

00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599
index to be aware of the fields uh

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:38.150
index to be aware of the fields uh product fields uh in the index you would

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160
product fields uh in the index you would

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.470
product fields uh in the index you would need to configure them using website

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480
need to configure them using website

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.910
need to configure them using website search yaml uh file. In this example we

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920
search yaml uh file. In this example we

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.510
search yaml uh file. In this example we are configuring fields for the product

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520
are configuring fields for the product

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.230
are configuring fields for the product entity uh for per each uh website. So as

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240
entity uh for per each uh website. So as

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.710
entity uh for per each uh website. So as I mentioned we can this is a placeholder

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720
I mentioned we can this is a placeholder

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.390
I mentioned we can this is a placeholder uh which indicates the scope uh we are

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400
uh which indicates the scope uh we are

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.270
uh which indicates the scope uh we are storing our data. So uh in this case we

00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280
storing our data. So uh in this case we

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.030
storing our data. So uh in this case we will be storing data uh product data per

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040
will be storing data uh product data per

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.109
will be storing data uh product data per the websites that we have in the system.

00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119
the websites that we have in the system.

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:10.630
the websites that we have in the system. So we will have like um with seven

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640
So we will have like um with seven

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.910
So we will have like um with seven websites we'll have seven different oro

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920
websites we'll have seven different oro

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.190
websites we'll have seven different oro product one or product three uh two and

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200
product one or product three uh two and

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.829
product one or product three uh two and three and so on uh indexes and uh one

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839
three and so on uh indexes and uh one

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:24.630
three and so on uh indexes and uh one two three these are the website ids uh

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640
two three these are the website ids uh

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.630
two three these are the website ids uh we have in a system and here we have a

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640
we have in a system and here we have a

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.910
we have in a system and here we have a list of uh fields uh available for the

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920
list of uh fields uh available for the

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.589
list of uh fields uh available for the index um in the index like the name of

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599
index um in the index like the name of

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.390
index um in the index like the name of the fields and actually the the type of

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400
the fields and actually the the type of

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.589
the fields and actually the the type of the of the fields either this is a text

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599
the of the fields either this is a text

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:42.790
the of the fields either this is a text integer and so on. And we may also have

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800
integer and so on. And we may also have

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.670
integer and so on. And we may also have the uh not only the index uh with the

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680
the uh not only the index uh with the

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.910
the uh not only the index uh with the placeholder like here we have with the

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920
placeholder like here we have with the

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.390
placeholder like here we have with the placeholder uh website which indicates

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400
placeholder uh website which indicates

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.430
placeholder uh website which indicates for the scope uh website scope different

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440
for the scope uh website scope different

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.109
for the scope uh website scope different indexes but may also have a fields per

00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119
indexes but may also have a fields per

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:02.710
indexes but may also have a fields per different uh scope of data like here all

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720
different uh scope of data like here all

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.870
different uh scope of data like here all text uh field we will have for all

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880
text uh field we will have for all

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.109
text uh field we will have for all localizations we have in in a system we

00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119
localizations we have in in a system we

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:13.990
localizations we have in in a system we will also have uh a fields uh in index

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000
will also have uh a fields uh in index

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.190
will also have uh a fields uh in index uh for all localizations all text one

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200
uh for all localizations all text one

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.470
uh for all localizations all text one all text two uh and this will be a

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480
all text two uh and this will be a

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.950
all text two uh and this will be a placeholder uh which will substitute

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960
placeholder uh which will substitute

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.430
placeholder uh which will substitute localization ID with the real uh

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440
localization ID with the real uh

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.630
localization ID with the real uh localization ID we have in the system

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.630
and so yeah if we would need to add um

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640
and so yeah if we would need to add um

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.950
and so yeah if we would need to add um additional fields you would need to

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960
additional fields you would need to

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.870
additional fields you would need to configure in your customization not

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880
configure in your customization not

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.670
configure in your customization not configure but define in your con config

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680
configure but define in your con config

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.550

using u this event and not event but

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.309
using u this event and not event but listening to the event u using the

00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319
listening to the event u using the

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:06.870
listening to the event u using the example here uh populate u defined um u

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880
example here uh populate u defined um u

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.030
example here uh populate u defined um u newly configured field.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.950
Okay. And the placeholders, yeah, they

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960
Okay. And the placeholders, yeah, they

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.829
Okay. And the placeholders, yeah, they are like the related to some specific

00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839
are like the related to some specific

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:23.190
are like the related to some specific scopes uh which should be stored in the

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200
scopes uh which should be stored in the

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.870
scopes uh which should be stored in the index per localization. You can

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880
index per localization. You can

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.470
index per localization. You can introduce actually and usually this is

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480
introduce actually and usually this is

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.589
introduce actually and usually this is done introduce your own scopes per for

00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599
done introduce your own scopes per for

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:32.390
done introduce your own scopes per for some field for instance depending on a

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400
some field for instance depending on a

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.870
some field for instance depending on a customer group or customer uh user or

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880
customer group or customer uh user or

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.390
customer group or customer uh user or customer.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400
customer.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.309
customer. Uh so you may have those fields like

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319
Uh so you may have those fields like

00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:43.030
Uh so you may have those fields like separated

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040
separated

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.589
separated depending on this uh scopes using

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599
depending on this uh scopes using

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:48.470
depending on this uh scopes using placeholders and while indexing or

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480
placeholders and while indexing or

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.230
placeholders and while indexing or reindexing products we have this helper

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240
reindexing products we have this helper

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.190
reindexing products we have this helper comment as I mentioned and it could be

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200
comment as I mentioned and it could be

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.550
comment as I mentioned and it could be uh executed u uh using um like the same

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560
uh executed u uh using um like the same

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.349
uh executed u uh using um like the same process you can u

00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359
process you can u

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:05.430
process you can u uh while running the command the same

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440
uh while running the command the same

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.550
uh while running the command the same process will be used to uh rein index

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560
process will be used to uh rein index

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.829
process will be used to uh rein index product. So you may use uh sh scheduled

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839
product. So you may use uh sh scheduled

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:14.870
product. So you may use uh sh scheduled option of this comment and in this way

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880
option of this comment and in this way

option of this comment and in this way the message will be put to the queue and

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280
the message will be put to the queue and

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.870
the message will be put to the queue and u u products u will be reindexed uh uh

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880
u u products u will be reindexed uh uh

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.190
u u products u will be reindexed uh uh in the background

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200
in the background

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.470
in the background and as a uh

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480
and as a uh

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.829
and as a uh data storage uh you could we could there

00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839
data storage uh you could we could there

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:34.230
data storage uh you could we could there is an ability to use elastic search or

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240
is an ability to use elastic search or

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.349
is an ability to use elastic search or database uh but elastic search is used

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359
database uh but elastic search is used

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:40.150
database uh but elastic search is used for the enterprise edition only and of

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160
for the enterprise edition only and of

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.230
for the enterprise edition only and of course you will get more benefits of

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240
course you will get more benefits of

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.349
course you will get more benefits of using elastic search.

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359
using elastic search.

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:49.670
using elastic search. Um better to to choose this one.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680
Um better to to choose this one.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:43:00.230
Um better to to choose this one. Okay.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.630
And those uh products which are um

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640
And those uh products which are um

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.309
And those uh products which are um listed in a storefront all of them uh so

00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319
listed in a storefront all of them uh so

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:11.750
listed in a storefront all of them uh so they are provided actually uh from the

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760
they are provided actually uh from the

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.430
they are provided actually uh from the uh from the index and this is u how it

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440
uh from the index and this is u how it

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.470
uh from the index and this is u how it is configured. Um so we have a data

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480
is configured. Um so we have a data

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.670
is configured. Um so we have a data grid. Um uh let's pick up this one

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680
grid. Um uh let's pick up this one

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.270
grid. Um uh let's pick up this one product select uh grid. And here we see

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280
product select uh grid. And here we see

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.670
product select uh grid. And here we see that the source of the um of the grid is

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680
that the source of the um of the grid is

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.510
that the source of the um of the grid is u search which is

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520
u search which is

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.710
u search which is um elastic search for the enterprise

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720
um elastic search for the enterprise

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.829
um elastic search for the enterprise edition and uh search index. we are

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839
edition and uh search index. we are

00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:43.750
edition and uh search index. we are picking up from the website uh index u

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760
picking up from the website uh index u

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.309
picking up from the website uh index u the the data and then quering for some

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319
the the data and then quering for some

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:50.630
the the data and then quering for some specific uh uh specific fields including

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640
specific uh uh specific fields including

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.150
specific uh uh specific fields including uh the uh placeholders. So substituting

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160
uh the uh placeholders. So substituting

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.470
uh the uh placeholders. So substituting those placeholders then with real values

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480
those placeholders then with real values

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.510
those placeholders then with real values uh of local currently enabled

00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520
uh of local currently enabled

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.630
uh of local currently enabled localization or

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640
localization or

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.470
localization or currently

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480
currently

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.950
currently navigating uh customer customer

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960
navigating uh customer customer

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.910
navigating uh customer customer depending on the placeholder

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920
depending on the placeholder

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.349
depending on the placeholder uh and uh yeah there are a few ways uh

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359
uh and uh yeah there are a few ways uh

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:16.870
uh and uh yeah there are a few ways uh how new data could be added to index.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880
how new data could be added to index.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.990
how new data could be added to index. One way I have just described we need uh

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000
One way I have just described we need uh

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.870
One way I have just described we need uh to manually specify uh the

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880
to manually specify uh the

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.230
to manually specify uh the the field we would like to add um and

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240
the field we would like to add um and

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.950
the field we would like to add um and its type and then uh populate that field

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960
its type and then uh populate that field

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.190
its type and then uh populate that field uh using uh event listener. Another

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200
uh using uh event listener. Another

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.390
uh using uh event listener. Another thing if you are another way if you are

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400
thing if you are another way if you are

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.750
thing if you are another way if you are introducing product attributes uh

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760
introducing product attributes uh

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.790
introducing product attributes uh especially filtered product attributes

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800
especially filtered product attributes

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.030
especially filtered product attributes then it will mean that uh those u uh

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040
then it will mean that uh those u uh

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.109
then it will mean that uh those u uh values and those fields will be

00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119
values and those fields will be

00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:54.630
values and those fields will be automatically

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640
automatically

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.190
automatically exposed uh to the index and will be uh

00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200
exposed uh to the index and will be uh

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.069
exposed uh to the index and will be uh uh added to the index and this is like

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079
uh added to the index and this is like

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:04.710
uh added to the index and this is like internal uh logic which handles that.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720
internal uh logic which handles that.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.550
internal uh logic which handles that. you would not need to uh perform any uh

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560
you would not need to uh perform any uh

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.550
you would not need to uh perform any uh additional uh customizations or you can

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560
additional uh customizations or you can

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.270
additional uh customizations or you can use like u an approach with mixing data

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280
use like u an approach with mixing data

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:22.390
use like u an approach with mixing data uh from different sources.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.309
So having some uh specific field but uh

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319
So having some uh specific field but uh

00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:29.829
So having some uh specific field but uh preparing the data depending on uh some

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839
preparing the data depending on uh some

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:33.670
preparing the data depending on uh some other records uh not records but uh so

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680
other records uh not records but uh so

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.790
other records uh not records but uh so here in this example uh we are having uh

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800
here in this example uh we are having uh

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.910
here in this example uh we are having uh a record which is uh a record of the

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920
a record which is uh a record of the

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.550
a record which is uh a record of the data grid. But then uh based on the

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560
data grid. But then uh based on the

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.710
data grid. But then uh based on the record uh defining a list of products uh

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720
record uh defining a list of products uh

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.550
record uh defining a list of products uh uh defining some uh shopping lists in

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560
uh defining some uh shopping lists in

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.470
uh defining some uh shopping lists in which this products to which these

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480
which this products to which these

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.910
which this products to which these products belong to and then adding uh

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920
products belong to and then adding uh

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.430
products belong to and then adding uh shopping lists uh this data to the index

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440
shopping lists uh this data to the index

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.710
shopping lists uh this data to the index to some u custom column. So in this way

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720
to some u custom column. So in this way

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.670
to some u custom column. So in this way we just exposing not the data that is

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680
we just exposing not the data that is

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.230
we just exposing not the data that is already exist in a product but also

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240
already exist in a product but also

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.910
already exist in a product but also doing some preparation and only then

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920
doing some preparation and only then

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.150
doing some preparation and only then exposing to the index for further usage

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160
exposing to the index for further usage

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.630
exposing to the index for further usage in your uh logic.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.030
Uh we have a configuration uh which uh

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040
Uh we have a configuration uh which uh

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.550
Uh we have a configuration uh which uh gives the ability to position uh uh

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560
gives the ability to position uh uh

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.150
gives the ability to position uh uh search uh to position filters in a uh

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160
search uh to position filters in a uh

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.550
search uh to position filters in a uh product list and page. Let me quickly

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560
product list and page. Let me quickly

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.030
product list and page. Let me quickly um sidebar

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040
um sidebar

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.349
um sidebar filters

00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359
filters

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:47.589
filters filters and sortters.

00:46:47.599 --> 00:47:07.670
And let's go here.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.790
Okay, here are the

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800
Okay, here are the

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.030
Okay, here are the the options I wanted to demonstrate. Uh

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040
the options I wanted to demonstrate. Uh

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.390
the options I wanted to demonstrate. Uh so using uh product uh uh listing page

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400
so using uh product uh uh listing page

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.390
so using uh product uh uh listing page uh we may have uh these filters expanded

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400
uh we may have uh these filters expanded

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.230
uh we may have uh these filters expanded or collapsed uh this one filters by

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240
or collapsed uh this one filters by

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.030
or collapsed uh this one filters by default and also position them here at

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040
default and also position them here at

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.309
default and also position them here at the top or change the position at the

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319
the top or change the position at the

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:36.390
the top or change the position at the sidebar. Uh so it was recent introduced

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400
sidebar. Uh so it was recent introduced

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.109
sidebar. Uh so it was recent introduced not so long ago maybe a year or u or two

00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119
not so long ago maybe a year or u or two

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:43.190
not so long ago maybe a year or u or two this sidebar because it was just

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200
this sidebar because it was just

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.349
this sidebar because it was just frequently requested by our clients.

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359
frequently requested by our clients.

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.430
frequently requested by our clients. They would like to have it on the left

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440
They would like to have it on the left

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.710
They would like to have it on the left hand side and uh here you are. Uh so

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720
hand side and uh here you are. Uh so

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.950
hand side and uh here you are. Uh so instead of doing some customization it

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960
instead of doing some customization it

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.630
instead of doing some customization it is available out of the box here.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.550
Okay. and uh a couple of uh best

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560
Okay. and uh a couple of uh best

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.589
Okay. and uh a couple of uh best practices or notes related to products

00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599
practices or notes related to products

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:12.390
practices or notes related to products and also master uh catalog.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400
and also master uh catalog.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.270
and also master uh catalog. Uh so first uh if we are talking about

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280
Uh so first uh if we are talking about

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.790
Uh so first uh if we are talking about products uh um whenever you introducing

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800
products uh um whenever you introducing

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.670
products uh um whenever you introducing uh new product attributes uh remember

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680
uh new product attributes uh remember

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.790
uh new product attributes uh remember there are a certain um set of uh

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800
there are a certain um set of uh

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.710
there are a certain um set of uh options that could be assigned to the

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720
options that could be assigned to the

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.870
options that could be assigned to the attributes like whether attributes

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880
attributes like whether attributes

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.190
attributes like whether attributes should be searchable, filterable or

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200
should be searchable, filterable or

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.430
should be searchable, filterable or sortable. And uh whenever you are adding

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440
sortable. And uh whenever you are adding

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.990
sortable. And uh whenever you are adding uh an attribute, please uh think

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000
uh an attribute, please uh think

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.910
uh an attribute, please uh think beforehand uh whether this attributes

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920
beforehand uh whether this attributes

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.670
beforehand uh whether this attributes should be searchable, filterable or

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680
should be searchable, filterable or

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.790
should be searchable, filterable or sortable uh for the data to be

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800
sortable uh for the data to be

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.190
sortable uh for the data to be uh to be stored at the very beginning

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200
uh to be stored at the very beginning

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.589
uh to be stored at the very beginning because otherwise when you would like

00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599
because otherwise when you would like

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.390
because otherwise when you would like them to change uh it will it might take

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400
them to change uh it will it might take

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.589
them to change uh it will it might take some time for reindexation and for

00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599
some time for reindexation and for

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:06.390
some time for reindexation and for preparing the data. um uh and having in

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400
preparing the data. um uh and having in

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.790
preparing the data. um uh and having in elastic search. And whenever you are uh

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800
elastic search. And whenever you are uh

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.109
elastic search. And whenever you are uh creating attributes also you are

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119
creating attributes also you are

00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:15.750
creating attributes also you are assigning them to some product families

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760
assigning them to some product families

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.549
assigning them to some product families and better to prepare families product

00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559
and better to prepare families product

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:21.030
and better to prepare families product families uh with the product attributes

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040
families uh with the product attributes

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.910
families uh with the product attributes at the very beginning because u and have

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920
at the very beginning because u and have

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.950
at the very beginning because u and have this uh assigning setup because if you

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960
this uh assigning setup because if you

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.390
this uh assigning setup because if you do this uh later and would like to uh

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400
do this uh later and would like to uh

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.230
do this uh later and would like to uh change uh uh product family to a

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240
change uh uh product family to a

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.030
change uh uh product family to a different one um so it will have like a

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040
different one um so it will have like a

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.030
different one um so it will have like a different set them of attributes. It

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040
different set them of attributes. It

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.270
different set them of attributes. It will be like a real pain, a real

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280
will be like a real pain, a real

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.430
will be like a real pain, a real headache and uh um yeah very very

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440
headache and uh um yeah very very

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.069
headache and uh um yeah very very complex thing to to resolve uh

00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079
complex thing to to resolve uh

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:50.230
complex thing to to resolve uh reassigning family a product to

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240
reassigning family a product to

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.750
reassigning family a product to different family.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760
different family.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.230
different family. Please do it beforehand like think and

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240
Please do it beforehand like think and

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.990
Please do it beforehand like think and design u products to

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000
design u products to

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.349
design u products to to the family properly because usually

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359
to the family properly because usually

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:07.270
to the family properly because usually uh clients are starting their setup with

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280
uh clients are starting their setup with

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.150
uh clients are starting their setup with some default family where all products

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160
some default family where all products

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.710
some default family where all products uh are included to this default default

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720
uh are included to this default default

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.150
uh are included to this default default family but then um in the middle uh of

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160
family but then um in the middle uh of

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.470
family but then um in the middle uh of running project they decide to separate

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480
running project they decide to separate

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.549
running project they decide to separate uh products between different uh

00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559
uh products between different uh

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:21.270
uh products between different uh families.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280
families.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.829
families. because they have should have different

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839
because they have should have different

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:27.030
because they have should have different attributes and in this case it will be a

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040
attributes and in this case it will be a

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.630
attributes and in this case it will be a headache. And remember we were

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640
headache. And remember we were

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:35.910
headache. And remember we were uh talking about uh product units u we

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920
uh talking about uh product units u we

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.829
uh talking about uh product units u we may have u several units u uh set up for

00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839
may have u several units u uh set up for

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:45.349
may have u several units u uh set up for the uh enabled for the product. Uh but

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359
the uh enabled for the product. Uh but

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:48.710
the uh enabled for the product. Uh but if in your case u single unit is enough

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720
if in your case u single unit is enough

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.790
if in your case u single unit is enough just enable it at the very beginning and

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800
just enable it at the very beginning and

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.470
just enable it at the very beginning and use it. Do not focus on uh multi-unit

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480
use it. Do not focus on uh multi-unit

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.430
use it. Do not focus on uh multi-unit mode.

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440
mode.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.430
mode. Okay, this is it related to products and

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440
Okay, this is it related to products and

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.950
Okay, this is it related to products and master catalog uh topic

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960
master catalog uh topic

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:19.109
master catalog uh topic and let's switch to the questions.

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:20.950
So the first question when you say

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960
So the first question when you say

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.950
So the first question when you say indexer are you referring to some uh uh

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960
indexer are you referring to some uh uh

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.430
indexer are you referring to some uh uh to some indexing process that generates

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440
to some indexing process that generates

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.309
to some indexing process that generates flat tables in the database from the raw

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319
flat tables in the database from the raw

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.790
flat tables in the database from the raw catalog data or it's just elastic search

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800
catalog data or it's just elastic search

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.470
catalog data or it's just elastic search or something similar that needs to be

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480
or something similar that needs to be

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.470
or something similar that needs to be indexed via message Q and you basically

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480
indexed via message Q and you basically

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.309
indexed via message Q and you basically answer the above question. So you can

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319
answer the above question. So you can

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:42.230
answer the above question. So you can ignore that. Okay. Are there any

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240
ignore that. Okay. Are there any

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.470
ignore that. Okay. Are there any indexing processes related to other

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480
indexing processes related to other

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.069
indexing processes related to other entity types or it is only for products?

00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079
entity types or it is only for products?

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:50.390
entity types or it is only for products? Okay. So

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400
Okay. So

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.670
Okay. So meant to say search not products. Uh so

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680
meant to say search not products. Uh so

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.190
meant to say search not products. Uh so this um so there are like

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200
this um so there are like

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.270
this um so there are like so first I will briefly u summarize. So

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280
so first I will briefly u summarize. So

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.670
so first I will briefly u summarize. So we do have like a lot of information

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680
we do have like a lot of information

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.549
we do have like a lot of information stored in a back office uh related to

00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559
stored in a back office uh related to

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:10.630
stored in a back office uh related to the product or to other entities. Uh but

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640
the product or to other entities. Uh but

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.950
the product or to other entities. Uh but searching uh performing search uh would

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960
searching uh performing search uh would

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.349
searching uh performing search uh would require us only limited set of data uh

00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359
require us only limited set of data uh

00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:22.790
require us only limited set of data uh to be checked uh for the search results.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800
to be checked uh for the search results.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.630
to be checked uh for the search results. That's why uh only limited amount is

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640
That's why uh only limited amount is

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.910
That's why uh only limited amount is data is uh prepared and then exposed to

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920
data is uh prepared and then exposed to

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.670
data is uh prepared and then exposed to the search index and under search index

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680
the search index and under search index

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.309
the search index and under search index uh could be could serve either a

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319
uh could be could serve either a

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:40.710
uh could be could serve either a database table or uh elastic search

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720
database table or uh elastic search

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.430
database table or uh elastic search could be used for that purpose. Um yeah

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440
could be used for that purpose. Um yeah

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.990
could be used for that purpose. Um yeah so the main idea to limit uh the amount

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000
so the main idea to limit uh the amount

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.349
so the main idea to limit uh the amount of data and expose only that that is uh

00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359
of data and expose only that that is uh

00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:54.230
of data and expose only that that is uh required for search for search results

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240
required for search for search results

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.790
required for search for search results and yeah to perform a quicker search and

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800
and yeah to perform a quicker search and

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.230
and yeah to perform a quicker search and the second thing is that uh while doing

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240
the second thing is that uh while doing

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.510
the second thing is that uh while doing indexing so what kind of data could be

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520
indexing so what kind of data could be

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.190
indexing so what kind of data could be exposed to to the index it could be uh

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200
exposed to to the index it could be uh

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.750
exposed to to the index it could be uh the data exposed related to the

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760
the data exposed related to the

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.630
the data exposed related to the storefront part and for the storefront

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640
storefront part and for the storefront

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.950
storefront part and for the storefront This is uh

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960
This is uh

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.790
This is uh uh product and brand entity. And another

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800
uh product and brand entity. And another

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.870
uh product and brand entity. And another thing uh we do also have a index a

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880
thing uh we do also have a index a

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.710
thing uh we do also have a index a separate index for the uh back office

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720
separate index for the uh back office

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.589
separate index for the uh back office data. So all uh customer customer user

00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599
data. So all uh customer customer user

00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:33.750
data. So all uh customer customer user entities uh orders and so on they are

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760
entities uh orders and so on they are

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.030
entities uh orders and so on they are exposed to the back office index and for

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040
exposed to the back office index and for

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.790
exposed to the back office index and for that we have like a different common for

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800
that we have like a different common for

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.190
that we have like a different common for for running u and different u processes

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200
for running u and different u processes

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.069
for running u and different u processes event listeners which tracks when the

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079
event listeners which tracks when the

00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:48.950
event listeners which tracks when the entity should be reindexed and put uh to

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960
entity should be reindexed and put uh to

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.990
entity should be reindexed and put uh to the to the index.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000
the to the index.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.589
the to the index. Uh

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.470
so we do have other processes related to

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480
so we do have other processes related to

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.870
so we do have other processes related to other other entities not only products

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880
other other entities not only products

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.390
related to trying improve like listing performance or is that also a search

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400
performance or is that also a search

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.069
performance or is that also a search index?

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079
index?

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:28.870
index? This is a search index. Okay. And it it

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880

And the next questions are all websites using a single category tree. Is it

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240
using a single category tree. Is it

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.150
using a single category tree. Is it possible to have more than a single uh

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160
possible to have more than a single uh

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.109
possible to have more than a single uh root category? Uh so all the websites

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119
root category? Uh so all the websites

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:20.710
root category? Uh so all the websites are using single category tree and uh

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720
are using single category tree and uh

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.309
are using single category tree and uh yeah there is no ability to to have uh

00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319
yeah there is no ability to to have uh

00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.390
yeah there is no ability to to have uh uh is it possible to have more than

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400
uh is it possible to have more than

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.390
uh is it possible to have more than single uh no it is not but um this is

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400
single uh no it is not but um this is

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.990
single uh no it is not but um this is the topic um we will cover

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000
the topic um we will cover

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.829
the topic um we will cover after the break. uh how you can um u use

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839
after the break. uh how you can um u use

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:42.309
after the break. uh how you can um u use you can you can have different uh uh

00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319
you can you can have different uh uh

00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:45.750
you can you can have different uh uh roots categories or category trees

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760
roots categories or category trees

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.789
roots categories or category trees depending on a on a website uh on the

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799
depending on a on a website uh on the

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.870
depending on a on a website uh on the websites that you have. So master

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880
websites that you have. So master

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.150
websites that you have. So master catalog is just for

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160
catalog is just for

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.870
catalog is just for main assigning uh products to the

main assigning uh products to the categories. Uh but then on top of it uh

00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079
categories. Uh but then on top of it uh

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:03.430
categories. Uh but then on top of it uh we may have so-called web catalog. Uh

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440
we may have so-called web catalog. Uh

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.430
we may have so-called web catalog. Uh this is master catalog and we will have

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440
this is master catalog and we will have

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.349
this is master catalog and we will have web catalog. And then within a web

00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359
web catalog. And then within a web

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:11.030
web catalog. And then within a web catalog we will have the ability to uh

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040
catalog we will have the ability to uh

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.150
catalog we will have the ability to uh have different uh three uh category

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160
have different uh three uh category

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.030
have different uh three uh category trees and then assign them uh for

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040
trees and then assign them uh for

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.510
trees and then assign them uh for different

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520
different

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.589
different use for different websites for different

00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599
use for different websites for different

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:37.109
use for different websites for different uh customer groups.

Okay. So we have products and we have

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:25.829
Okay. So we have products and we have categorized products uh using master uh

00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839
categorized products uh using master uh

00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:28.630
categorized products uh using master uh catalog. So with that we have single

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640
catalog. So with that we have single

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.549
catalog. So with that we have single product assigned to single category uh

product assigned to single category uh of master catalog. Now we would like to

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520
of master catalog. Now we would like to

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.390
of master catalog. Now we would like to have uh to present u a user uh a

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400

how products are assigned to the categories. For that we have uh

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839
categories. For that we have uh

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:55.430
categories. For that we have uh so-called web cataloges and uh web

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440
so-called web cataloges and uh web

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.430

group of customer. It uh uh might have the catalog, might

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000
It uh uh might have the catalog, might

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.950
It uh uh might have the catalog, might have different uh uh

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960
have different uh uh

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.750
have different uh uh type of pages. Uh not only a collection

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760
type of pages. Uh not only a collection

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.349
type of pages. Uh not only a collection of products as we usually uh get used

00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359
of products as we usually uh get used

00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:39.510
of products as we usually uh get used to, but also uh some landing pages, some

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520
to, but also uh some landing pages, some

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.430
to, but also uh some landing pages, some uh pre-existing

uh pre-existing

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:45.829
uh pre-existing system pages or

00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:48.549
um collections of products which are not

00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559
um collections of products which are not

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:51.750
um collections of products which are not really strict to specific category. We

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760
really strict to specific category. We

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.950
really strict to specific category. We will check that. And this was the the

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960
will check that. And this was the the

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.349
will check that. And this was the the aim of this concept is to have better uh

00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359
aim of this concept is to have better uh

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:02.950
aim of this concept is to have better uh purchase experience of uh end users.

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960
purchase experience of uh end users.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.950
purchase experience of uh end users. Uh yeah and have more more purchases. Uh

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960
Uh yeah and have more more purchases. Uh

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.870
Uh yeah and have more more purchases. Uh and

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880
and

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.470
and uh

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480
uh

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.309
uh okay uh

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319
okay uh

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:20.069
okay uh uh let's check uh probably

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:22.630
uh yeah I will check in a in a few

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640
uh yeah I will check in a in a few

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.470
uh yeah I will check in a in a few minutes.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.470
Okay I will start with the demonstration

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480
Okay I will start with the demonstration

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.109
Okay I will start with the demonstration how it looks.

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119
how it looks.

00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:34.390
how it looks. Uh let's go to the back office and as I

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400
Uh let's go to the back office and as I

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.069
Uh let's go to the back office and as I mentioned this is a content management

00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079
mentioned this is a content management

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:40.150
mentioned this is a content management tool right uh that's why this uh it

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160
tool right uh that's why this uh it

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.150
tool right uh that's why this uh it should be under marketing u uh under

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160
should be under marketing u uh under

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.789
should be under marketing u uh under marketing so web catalog

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:51.109
web catalog

00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119
web catalog

00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:53.430
web catalog so out of the box we have like a default

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440
so out of the box we have like a default

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.430
so out of the box we have like a default uh with the demo data default web

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440
uh with the demo data default web

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.309
uh with the demo data default web catalog we will check it how but we can

00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319
catalog we will check it how but we can

00:59:58.319 --> 01:00:01.670
catalog we will check it how but we can create as many web cataloges as we uh

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680
create as many web cataloges as we uh

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.430
create as many web cataloges as we uh would like to have uh then u with an

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440
would like to have uh then u with an

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.390
would like to have uh then u with an ability to assign them or use them for

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400
ability to assign them or use them for

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.470
ability to assign them or use them for different websites uh uh in our in our

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480
different websites uh uh in our in our

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.470
different websites uh uh in our in our application

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480
application

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.270
application it takes

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280
it takes

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.150
it takes for some reason

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160
for some reason

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.630
for some reason time that I am expecting okay for

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640
time that I am expecting okay for

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.950
time that I am expecting okay for creating a catalog what you would need

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960
creating a catalog what you would need

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.710
creating a catalog what you would need to provide is a name description and

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720
to provide is a name description and

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.270
to provide is a name description and that's

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.150
you have a catalog then you once you

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160
you have a catalog then you once you

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.549
you have a catalog then you once you have a catalog created then you are able

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559
have a catalog created then you are able

01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:40.870
have a catalog created then you are able to uh create a tree of this uh web

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880
to uh create a tree of this uh web

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.069
to uh create a tree of this uh web catalog. So uh navigating to addit

01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079
catalog. So uh navigating to addit

01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:48.069
catalog. So uh navigating to addit content tree we are able to u create

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079
content tree we are able to u create

01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:53.030
content tree we are able to u create some content nodes

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.190
assign uh some u what kind of variance

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200
assign uh some u what kind of variance

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.069
assign uh some u what kind of variance of the content

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079
of the content

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.710
of the content note should be but we will check it on a

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720
note should be but we will check it on a

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.789
note should be but we will check it on a real example we have already in the

01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799
real example we have already in the

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:07.030
real example we have already in the database.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040
database.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.309
database. Let me switch back to web cataloges. Um

01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319
Let me switch back to web cataloges. Um

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:13.190
Let me switch back to web cataloges. Um so the one that already exists I will go

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200
so the one that already exists I will go

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.309
so the one that already exists I will go to edit content tree and we will check

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319
to edit content tree and we will check

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:19.990
to edit content tree and we will check here. So we have a main uh root content

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000
here. So we have a main uh root content

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.710
here. So we have a main uh root content node which is called default web catalog

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720
node which is called default web catalog

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.270
node which is called default web catalog and it contains of uh

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280
and it contains of uh

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.829
and it contains of uh sub uh sub nodes and uh with that we

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839
sub uh sub nodes and uh with that we

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:34.789
sub uh sub nodes and uh with that we have like a navigation route node which

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799
have like a navigation route node which

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:38.230
have like a navigation route node which will be used for navigation and we have

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240
will be used for navigation and we have

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.549
will be used for navigation and we have u a notes for categorizing products by

01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559
u a notes for categorizing products by

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:46.950
u a notes for categorizing products by category by brand by clearance

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960
category by brand by clearance

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.190
category by brand by clearance and so on

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200
and so on

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.030
and so on by filtering or categorizing products by

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040
by filtering or categorizing products by

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.950
by filtering or categorizing products by new arrivals and other stuff.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960
new arrivals and other stuff.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.510
new arrivals and other stuff. Uh

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.710
okay, we have a web catalog. Web catalog

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720
okay, we have a web catalog. Web catalog

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.789
okay, we have a web catalog. Web catalog contains of um this is a tree of some

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799
contains of um this is a tree of some

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:18.230
contains of um this is a tree of some nodes. Uh so each node

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.349
Each note

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359
Each note

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:24.390
Each note uh contains of the title um this slack I

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400
uh contains of the title um this slack I

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.470
uh contains of the title um this slack I will check a bit later the URL slack

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480
will check a bit later the URL slack

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.109
will check a bit later the URL slack which gives us the ability to then

01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119
which gives us the ability to then

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:33.430
which gives us the ability to then access this web catalog uh node uh some

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440
access this web catalog uh node uh some

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.390
access this web catalog uh node uh some search engine optimization uh options

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400
search engine optimization uh options

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.950
search engine optimization uh options similar to those we have checked for the

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960
similar to those we have checked for the

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.829
similar to those we have checked for the category and for the products. I will

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839
category and for the products. I will

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:47.109
category and for the products. I will not uh stop on this. And we have a

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119
not uh stop on this. And we have a

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:51.589
not uh stop on this. And we have a restrictions for the

01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599
restrictions for the

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:54.950
restrictions for the uh to specify restrictions uh which will

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960
uh to specify restrictions uh which will

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.309
uh to specify restrictions uh which will mean uh so uh to which uh this uh

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319
mean uh so uh to which uh this uh

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:03.670
mean uh so uh to which uh this uh content not uh of web catalog will be

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680
content not uh of web catalog will be

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.270
content not uh of web catalog will be available. So uh in this certain case u

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280
available. So uh in this certain case u

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.990
available. So uh in this certain case u it will be available for the company A

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000
it will be available for the company A

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.990
it will be available for the company A but I will actually demonstrate in a

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000
but I will actually demonstrate in a

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.710
but I will actually demonstrate in a moment. Uh and uh we are able to specify

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720
moment. Uh and uh we are able to specify

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.029
moment. Uh and uh we are able to specify so restrictions plus uh what kind of uh

01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039
so restrictions plus uh what kind of uh

01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:25.670
so restrictions plus uh what kind of uh varants um uh could should have this u

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680
varants um uh could should have this u

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.349
varants um uh could should have this u content note. Um

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:34.549
okay let's

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559
okay let's

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:37.430
okay let's switch one step back.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440
switch one step back.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.549
switch one step back. Um before I start configuring and uh

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559
Um before I start configuring and uh

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.910
Um before I start configuring and uh performing some changes and

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920
performing some changes and

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.470
performing some changes and demonstrating I will

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480
demonstrating I will

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.630
demonstrating I will uh demonstrate one uh one thing

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640
uh demonstrate one uh one thing

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:57.510
uh demonstrate one uh one thing um

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:05.910
okay so under routing

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:17.430
so on websites routin

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.029
uh we have

01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039
uh we have

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:23.910
uh we have a setting to specify what kind of web

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920
a setting to specify what kind of web

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.390
a setting to specify what kind of web catalog uh could be used. Remember we

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400
catalog uh could be used. Remember we

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.589
catalog uh could be used. Remember we have uh we have the ability to create

01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599
have uh we have the ability to create

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:33.589
have uh we have the ability to create several content uh web cataloges and uh

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599
several content uh web cataloges and uh

01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:40.870
several content uh web cataloges and uh then we are able to assign them uh

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.349
either uh on a global configuration

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359
either uh on a global configuration

01:04:43.359 --> 01:04:48.230
either uh on a global configuration level or navigating to the uh to the uh

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240
level or navigating to the uh to the uh

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.270
level or navigating to the uh to the uh specific website uh specific website uh

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280
specific website uh specific website uh

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.910
specific website uh specific website uh configuration uh assign some specific

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920
configuration uh assign some specific

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.109
configuration uh assign some specific for instance the I would like to uh use

01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119
for instance the I would like to uh use

01:04:57.119 --> 01:05:01.109
for instance the I would like to uh use for the uh all the websites as a default

01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119
for the uh all the websites as a default

01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:04.069
for the uh all the websites as a default web catalog this one. But on the other

01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079
web catalog this one. But on the other

01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:07.270
web catalog this one. But on the other hand side navigating to website uh

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280
hand side navigating to website uh

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.109
hand side navigating to website uh configurations

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119
configurations

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:15.510
configurations uh I might have a specific um web

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520
uh I might have a specific um web

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:21.589
uh I might have a specific um web catalog for uh this Canada website.

01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599
catalog for uh this Canada website.

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:25.349
catalog for uh this Canada website. So this is the option which manages uh

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359
So this is the option which manages uh

01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:28.309
So this is the option which manages uh assigning uh

01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319
assigning uh

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:31.190
assigning uh cataloges to different u depending on

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200
cataloges to different u depending on

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.109
cataloges to different u depending on different websites. Okay, let's keep it

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119
different websites. Okay, let's keep it

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.630
different websites. Okay, let's keep it u

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640
u

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.870
u uh don't change. And uh

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880
uh don't change. And uh

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.710
uh don't change. And uh so we have a web catalog which is

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720
so we have a web catalog which is

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.950
so we have a web catalog which is assigned um to the website or globally.

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960
assigned um to the website or globally.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.510
assigned um to the website or globally. And once we have a web catalog, we are

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520
And once we have a web catalog, we are

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.029
And once we have a web catalog, we are able to specify uh what kind of uh uh

01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039
able to specify uh what kind of uh uh

01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:57.829
able to specify uh what kind of uh uh node should be used as a navigation

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839
node should be used as a navigation

01:05:57.839 --> 01:06:02.150
node should be used as a navigation route of this web catalog. U so we have

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160
route of this web catalog. U so we have

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.829
route of this web catalog. U so we have this specified here navigation route. Uh

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839
this specified here navigation route. Uh

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:09.589
this specified here navigation route. Uh remember we have uh this default web uh

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599
remember we have uh this default web uh

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.870
remember we have uh this default web uh catalog three navigation route products

01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880
catalog three navigation route products

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.510
catalog three navigation route products and I have specified that uh my

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520
and I have specified that uh my

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.029
and I have specified that uh my navigation route of main navigation menu

01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039
navigation route of main navigation menu

01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:21.990
navigation route of main navigation menu uh will start providing its navigation

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000
uh will start providing its navigation

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.309
uh will start providing its navigation items uh from navigation root uh node

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319
items uh from navigation root uh node

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:29.670
items uh from navigation root uh node uh we have these changes. Okay. So

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680
uh we have these changes. Okay. So

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.630
uh we have these changes. Okay. So whenever I am

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640
whenever I am

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.829
whenever I am on a website I uh do have the same

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839
on a website I uh do have the same

01:06:35.839 --> 01:06:37.670
on a website I uh do have the same navigation that was assigned in a

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680
navigation that was assigned in a

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.470
navigation that was assigned in a configuration. So products new arrivals

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480
configuration. So products new arrivals

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.789
configuration. So products new arrivals clearance and with some subcategories uh

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799
clearance and with some subcategories uh

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:47.510
clearance and with some subcategories uh sub nodes of this web catalog. So you

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520
sub nodes of this web catalog. So you

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.789
sub nodes of this web catalog. So you see they are all reflecting uh the same

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799
see they are all reflecting uh the same

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.950
see they are all reflecting uh the same structure we

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960
structure we

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.789
structure we uh we have in a uh web catalog.

01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799
uh we have in a uh web catalog.

01:06:56.799 --> 01:06:59.510
uh we have in a uh web catalog. Let me switch back. So navigation route

01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520
Let me switch back. So navigation route

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.789
Let me switch back. So navigation route then products by category by brand new

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799
then products by category by brand new

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:04.309
then products by category by brand new arrivals

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319
arrivals

01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:07.510
arrivals all that stuff is listed here.

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520
all that stuff is listed here.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.710
all that stuff is listed here. If I uh do not specify uh

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720
If I uh do not specify uh

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.029
If I uh do not specify uh okay let me then uh demonstrate that how

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039
okay let me then uh demonstrate that how

01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:17.750
okay let me then uh demonstrate that how navigation rout works. Now I will change

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760
navigation rout works. Now I will change

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.349
navigation rout works. Now I will change and u uh make navigation route start

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359
and u uh make navigation route start

01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:25.589
and u uh make navigation route start from products. I will save the changes.

01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599
from products. I will save the changes.

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:28.150
from products. I will save the changes. I will refresh the page.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160
I will refresh the page.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.670
I will refresh the page. Before that we have products new

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680
Before that we have products new

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.710
Before that we have products new arrivals clearance I have changed and

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720
arrivals clearance I have changed and

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.109
arrivals clearance I have changed and now it starts from another level um and

01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119
now it starts from another level um and

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:40.230
now it starts from another level um and we have it listed by category by brand

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240
we have it listed by category by brand

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.230
we have it listed by category by brand by clearance these levels

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240
by clearance these levels

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.950
by clearance these levels I will revert the change

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960
I will revert the change

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.430
I will revert the change and I will also demonstrate. So if we

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440
and I will also demonstrate. So if we

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.470
and I will also demonstrate. So if we are not using web catalog

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480
are not using web catalog

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.150
are not using web catalog uh if I clear this option then for

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160
uh if I clear this option then for

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.549
uh if I clear this option then for navigation I will be using uh the

01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559
navigation I will be using uh the

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:01.430
navigation I will be using uh the website will be using master catalog. I

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440
website will be using master catalog. I

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.069
website will be using master catalog. I will save the changes.

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:10.470
I will refresh the page. And now we have

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480
I will refresh the page. And now we have

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.109
I will refresh the page. And now we have the navigation menu provided from master

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119
the navigation menu provided from master

01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:17.349
the navigation menu provided from master catalog. The one we were configuring at

01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359
catalog. The one we were configuring at

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.430
catalog. The one we were configuring at the very beginning of day one of day

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440
the very beginning of day one of day

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.390
the very beginning of day one of day two. Uh lightning products medical. So

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400
two. Uh lightning products medical. So

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.630
two. Uh lightning products medical. So these are categories of master u uh

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640
these are categories of master u uh

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.189
these are categories of master u uh master catalog.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199
master catalog.

01:08:29.199 --> 01:08:31.110
master catalog. Yeah. But if you would like to have like

01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120
Yeah. But if you would like to have like

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.749
Yeah. But if you would like to have like some specific u uh user experience not

01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759
some specific u uh user experience not

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:39.189
some specific u uh user experience not uh tied to the master catalog then we

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199
uh tied to the master catalog then we

01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:43.829
uh tied to the master catalog then we are using web catalog. Let me u

01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839
are using web catalog. Let me u

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:47.349
are using web catalog. Let me u assign web catalog and continue

01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359
assign web catalog and continue

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:55.110
assign web catalog and continue configuring it.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.269
I have reverted the changes. Let's

01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279
I have reverted the changes. Let's

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.030
I have reverted the changes. Let's check.

01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040
check.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.510
check. Now we are back and using web catalog

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520
Now we are back and using web catalog

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.709
Now we are back and using web catalog for navigation menu and we'll continue

01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719
for navigation menu and we'll continue

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:07.430
for navigation menu and we'll continue checking how we can set up this web

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440
checking how we can set up this web

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.950
checking how we can set up this web catalog.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960
catalog.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.189
catalog. Let me switch back to the uh to the

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199
Let me switch back to the uh to the

01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:14.470
Let me switch back to the uh to the slides. So we have the ability to um

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480
slides. So we have the ability to um

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.910
slides. So we have the ability to um create multiple web cataloges and then

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920
create multiple web cataloges and then

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.630
create multiple web cataloges and then assign them uh per different websites.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640
assign them uh per different websites.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.630
assign them uh per different websites. And this is how you will have different

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640
And this is how you will have different

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.309
And this is how you will have different user experience uh different web catalog

01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319
user experience uh different web catalog

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:33.189
user experience uh different web catalog uh depending on a website user is using

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199
uh depending on a website user is using

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:35.430
uh depending on a website user is using uh yeah but on the other hand side you

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440
uh yeah but on the other hand side you

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.709
uh yeah but on the other hand side you can reuse the same web catalog between

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719
can reuse the same web catalog between

01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:41.910
can reuse the same web catalog between uh different websites or assign the same

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920
uh different websites or assign the same

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.470
uh different websites or assign the same web catalog to different websites.

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480
web catalog to different websites.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.510
web catalog to different websites. uh I have demonstrated how web catalog

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520
uh I have demonstrated how web catalog

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.269
uh I have demonstrated how web catalog is used to build the navigation menu. So

01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279
is used to build the navigation menu. So

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.310
is used to build the navigation menu. So this is is set up as a source of the

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320
this is is set up as a source of the

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.470
this is is set up as a source of the navigation menu. Plus we are able to set

01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480
navigation menu. Plus we are able to set

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.590
navigation menu. Plus we are able to set up what from what u route we are

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600
up what from what u route we are

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.950
up what from what u route we are starting uh from what node sorry we are

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960
starting uh from what node sorry we are

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.990
starting uh from what node sorry we are starting our navigation menu

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000
starting our navigation menu

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.669
starting our navigation menu and this is managed in system

01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679
and this is managed in system

01:10:09.679 --> 01:10:13.750
and this is managed in system configuration. We have just checked

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760
configuration. We have just checked

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.110
configuration. We have just checked uh yeah the navigation menu it contains

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120
uh yeah the navigation menu it contains

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.149
uh yeah the navigation menu it contains several levels and depending on what

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159
several levels and depending on what

01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:24.229
several levels and depending on what level we are uh in it like opens second

01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239
level we are uh in it like opens second

01:10:24.239 --> 01:10:28.070
level we are uh in it like opens second levels and all other u nested levels of

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080
levels and all other u nested levels of

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.990
levels and all other u nested levels of this uh of the content uh web catalog uh

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000
this uh of the content uh web catalog uh

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.669
this uh of the content uh web catalog uh nodes web catalog tree.

01:10:37.679 --> 01:10:41.990
Uh we have checked briefly uh of what uh

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000
Uh we have checked briefly uh of what uh

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.830
Uh we have checked briefly uh of what uh properties web catalog note contains

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840
properties web catalog note contains

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.110
properties web catalog note contains and uh title URL some restrictions. Uh

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120
and uh title URL some restrictions. Uh

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.229
and uh title URL some restrictions. Uh but uh the main thing we have not

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239
but uh the main thing we have not

01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:56.149
but uh the main thing we have not touched. So I will demonstrate how

01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159
touched. So I will demonstrate how

01:10:56.159 --> 01:10:58.550
touched. So I will demonstrate how restriction works and then we will

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560
restriction works and then we will

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.950
restriction works and then we will switch to different variants. Okay. Uh

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960
switch to different variants. Okay. Uh

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.950
switch to different variants. Okay. Uh so let me demonstrate how restriction

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960
so let me demonstrate how restriction

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.550
so let me demonstrate how restriction works.

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560
works.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.590
works. Uh so I have this web catalog uh tree

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600
Uh so I have this web catalog uh tree

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.669
Uh so I have this web catalog uh tree with the favorite products. Uh right now

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679
with the favorite products. Uh right now

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:18.550
with the favorite products. Uh right now this favorite products is pointing to to

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560
this favorite products is pointing to to

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.430
this favorite products is pointing to to homepage

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440
homepage

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.830
homepage and uh let me save the changes

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840
and uh let me save the changes

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.590
and uh let me save the changes and simply

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.390
right now it has no restrictions. uh

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400
right now it has no restrictions. uh

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.310
right now it has no restrictions. uh those variants what kind of variants we

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320
those variants what kind of variants we

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.229
those variants what kind of variants we will cover in a moment let's check

favorite products. I am able to access favorite products because this uh uh

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280
favorite products because this uh uh

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.430
favorite products because this uh uh content node it is restricted and

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440
content node it is restricted and

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.870
content node it is restricted and specifically allowed only for company A

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880
specifically allowed only for company A

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.750

uh customer users.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.270
uh customer users. This is how restriction works on

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280
This is how restriction works on

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.790
This is how restriction works on uh

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800
uh

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.870
uh on the content on the whole content

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880
on the content on the whole content

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.110
on the content on the whole content node. We will also then check how they

01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120
node. We will also then check how they

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.149
node. We will also then check how they works depending on the variance.

01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159
works depending on the variance.

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:08.070
works depending on the variance. Okay, I will revert the change save.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.470
Let me switch back to slides to check.

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480
Let me switch back to slides to check.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.510
Let me switch back to slides to check. Um so where restrictions I have

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520
Um so where restrictions I have

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.310
Um so where restrictions I have demonstrated see fields nothing special

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320
demonstrated see fields nothing special

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.950
demonstrated see fields nothing special to add they act the same as for the

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960
to add they act the same as for the

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.590
to add they act the same as for the category or for the products. Uh let's

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600
category or for the products. Uh let's

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.189
category or for the products. Uh let's uh check uh content note restrictions.

01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199
uh check uh content note restrictions.

01:14:27.199 --> 01:14:28.950
uh check uh content note restrictions. Okay.

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960
Okay.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.669
Okay. Um

01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679
Um

01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:37.669
Um okay.

01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:41.350
Okay. Uh so we have a web catalog uh

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360
Okay. Uh so we have a web catalog uh

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.750
Okay. Uh so we have a web catalog uh node favorite products. We have the

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760
node favorite products. We have the

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.630
node favorite products. We have the ability to restrict this node per

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640
ability to restrict this node per

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.350
ability to restrict this node per depending on a customer customer group

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360
depending on a customer customer group

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.750
depending on a customer customer group website or localization. Under

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760
website or localization. Under

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.149
website or localization. Under restriction it is it means uh whom we

01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159
restriction it is it means uh whom we

On the other hand side, we are

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.189
On the other hand side, we are specifying uh within a content variance

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199
specifying uh within a content variance

01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:15.750

um uh node favorite products node and it might be um different uh

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920
it might be um different uh

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.470
it might be um different uh depending on your needs. So um

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.950
plus

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960
plus

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.950
plus it might be uh we can have several uh

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960
it might be uh we can have several uh

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.270
it might be uh we can have several uh variants uh for the content node. Uh you

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280
variants uh for the content node. Uh you

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.070
variants uh for the content node. Uh you see that I have just created one this

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080
see that I have just created one this

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.390
see that I have just created one this one system page another one and then I

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400
one system page another one and then I

01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.229
one system page another one and then I can uh restrict uh and specify to what

01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239
can uh restrict uh and specify to what

01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:02.070
can uh restrict uh and specify to what customer group or website or

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080
customer group or website or

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.750
customer group or website or localization to display this or that

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760
localization to display this or that

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.550
localization to display this or that content variant. Let's actually start

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560
content variant. Let's actually start

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.750
content variant. Let's actually start demonstrating. I will start

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760
demonstrating. I will start

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.590
demonstrating. I will start demonstrating with different um content

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600
demonstrating with different um content

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.590
demonstrating with different um content variants. um what kind of uh contents

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600
variants. um what kind of uh contents

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.950
variants. um what kind of uh contents could be listed per each individual

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960
could be listed per each individual

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.550
could be listed per each individual node.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560
node.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.430
node. Okay, I will start with the

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440
Okay, I will start with the

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.070
Okay, I will start with the uh let me check uh what I have here in

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080
uh let me check uh what I have here in

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.149
uh let me check uh what I have here in the

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159
the

01:16:30.159 --> 01:16:33.910
the uh on the slides.

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920
uh on the slides.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.470
uh on the slides. Uh so variant okay variant itself it

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480
Uh so variant okay variant itself it

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.790
Uh so variant okay variant itself it represents that content that is visible

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800
represents that content that is visible

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.990
represents that content that is visible for the user and we may have several

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000
for the user and we may have several

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.590
for the user and we may have several variants.

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600
variants.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.229
variants. One is marked as default. Others then

01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239
One is marked as default. Others then

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:50.790
One is marked as default. Others then are u restricted uh

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800
are u restricted uh

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.790
are u restricted uh depending on different levels. We have

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800
depending on different levels. We have

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.709
depending on different levels. We have customer custom group and so on. And uh

01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719
customer custom group and so on. And uh

01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:01.590
customer custom group and so on. And uh non-default uh variants they should be

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600
non-default uh variants they should be

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.950
non-default uh variants they should be always uh restricted to uh the depending

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960
always uh restricted to uh the depending

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.669
always uh restricted to uh the depending on on some level. So the default should

01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679
on on some level. So the default should

01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:12.390
on on some level. So the default should have no restrictions but then on top we

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400
have no restrictions but then on top we

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.350
have no restrictions but then on top we have other variants uh content variants

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360
have other variants uh content variants

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.870
have other variants uh content variants that should be uh restricted

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880
that should be uh restricted

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.110
that should be uh restricted depending on customer group or website

01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120
depending on customer group or website

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.790
depending on customer group or website or localization.

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800
or localization.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.110
or localization. What kind of uh variance uh web catalog

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120
What kind of uh variance uh web catalog

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.830
What kind of uh variance uh web catalog note could have uh first it could have a

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840
note could have uh first it could have a

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.669
note could have uh first it could have a type be of system page type of product

01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679
type be of system page type of product

01:17:35.679 --> 01:17:37.750
type be of system page type of product product collection category and landing

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760
product collection category and landing

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.550
product collection category and landing page. So like three uh five of them

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560
page. So like three uh five of them

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.390
page. So like three uh five of them right but the number of types they are

01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400
right but the number of types they are

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.110
right but the number of types they are not limited and we have uh cases when

01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120
not limited and we have uh cases when

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.470
not limited and we have uh cases when this uh list of types is extended with

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480
this uh list of types is extended with

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.350
this uh list of types is extended with some additional uh types which is

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360
some additional uh types which is

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.110
some additional uh types which is preferable by the clients and we have a

01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120
preferable by the clients and we have a

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.270
preferable by the clients and we have a documentation how to create uh to

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960
introduce another type uh mainly it

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.790
introduce another type uh mainly it should implement this content variant

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800
should implement this content variant

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.950
should implement this content variant type interface is and we should have

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960
type interface is and we should have

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.350
type interface is and we should have like step by step uh uh what should be

so if you would like to add some content variant we should go to the content

01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159
variant we should go to the content

01:19:16.159 --> 01:19:20.950
variant we should go to the content variant section and here select the type

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960
variant section and here select the type

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.350
variant section and here select the type of the variant we would like to add in

of the variant we would like to add in

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.110
of the variant we would like to add in our case we will start with the system

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120
our case we will start with the system

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.709
our case we will start with the system page so system page it provides a form

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719
page so system page it provides a form

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:32.870
page so system page it provides a form with one single field uh to specify what

01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880
with one single field uh to specify what

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.630
with one single field uh to specify what kind of system page root to use. Here we

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640
kind of system page root to use. Here we

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.350
kind of system page root to use. Here we have like a list of them. You see that

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360
have like a list of them. You see that

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:44.070
have like a list of them. You see that uh not so much probably of them and

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080
uh not so much probably of them and

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.669
uh not so much probably of them and these are system uh pages which uh exist

01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679
these are system uh pages which uh exist

01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:51.990
these are system uh pages which uh exist in u storefront actually storefront

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360
collection. Within a product collection,

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.590
collection. Within a product collection, let's go here. I will remove this one.

01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600
let's go here. I will remove this one.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.750
let's go here. I will remove this one. We have a product collection. Okay.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760
We have a product collection. Okay.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.669
We have a product collection. Okay. Within a product collection, we have a

01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679
Within a product collection, we have a

01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:35.189
Within a product collection, we have a form which gives us to the ability to

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199
form which gives us to the ability to

01:26:35.199 --> 01:26:38.310
form which gives us to the ability to specify what collection of products you

01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320
specify what collection of products you

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.350
specify what collection of products you would like to be listed on this page.

01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360
would like to be listed on this page.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.229
would like to be listed on this page. And this is where we can u have a

01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239
And this is where we can u have a

01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:52.070
And this is where we can u have a category category tree uh with the nodes

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080
category category tree uh with the nodes

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.430
category category tree uh with the nodes which contain uh duplicated values of

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440
which contain uh duplicated values of

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.229
which contain uh duplicated values of the uh of the product. So imagine we

01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239
the uh of the product. So imagine we

01:26:58.239 --> 01:27:01.669
the uh of the product. So imagine we have uh like few favorite uh products

01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679
have uh like few favorite uh products

01:27:01.679 --> 01:27:04.229
have uh like few favorite uh products categories and we assign we can assign

01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239
categories and we assign we can assign

01:27:04.239 --> 01:27:07.030
categories and we assign we can assign the same product to different u to

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040
the same product to different u to

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.430
the same product to different u to different nodes of this uh of this tree.

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440
different nodes of this uh of this tree.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.790
different nodes of this uh of this tree. And I will um so there is there are a

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800
And I will um so there is there are a

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.390
And I will um so there is there are a few options how we can assign

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400
few options how we can assign

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.270
few options how we can assign products to this collection. Uh one of

01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280
products to this collection. Uh one of

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.590
products to this collection. Uh one of the option we can simply specify a

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600
the option we can simply specify a

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.030
the option we can simply specify a segment name. Um

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040
segment name. Um

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.830
segment name. Um so if we have um system

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840
so if we have um system

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.310
so if we have um system um

01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320
um

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.030
um no reports reports and segments so we

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040
no reports reports and segments so we

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.229
no reports reports and segments so we can uh create a segment using uh manage

01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239
can uh create a segment using uh manage

01:27:40.239 --> 01:27:42.950
can uh create a segment using uh manage segments and in a segment specify

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960
segments and in a segment specify

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.470
segments and in a segment specify product some uh product entity. Okay,

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480
product some uh product entity. Okay,

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.709
product some uh product entity. Okay, let me open quickly.

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719
let me open quickly.

01:27:48.719 --> 01:27:51.910
let me open quickly. We can create a segment, specify a

01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920
We can create a segment, specify a

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.910
We can create a segment, specify a product uh

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.750
for the product entity to create a

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760
for the product entity to create a

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.350
for the product entity to create a segment.

01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360
segment.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.110
segment. uh create uh some dynamic type,

01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120
uh create uh some dynamic type,

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.229
uh create uh some dynamic type, pick up some columns, pick up filters

01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239
pick up some columns, pick up filters

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:10.070
pick up some columns, pick up filters and actually you will have uh a segment

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080
and actually you will have uh a segment

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.510
and actually you will have uh a segment which include some set of uh products

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520
which include some set of uh products

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.070
which include some set of uh products like featured products not depending on

01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080
like featured products not depending on

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.229
like featured products not depending on some specific flag and then uh you can

01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239
some specific flag and then uh you can

01:28:20.239 --> 01:28:23.350
some specific flag and then uh you can specify the name of the segment

01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360
specify the name of the segment

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.070
specify the name of the segment uh here in the

01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080
uh here in the

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.070
uh here in the uh for the product collection. Another

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080
uh for the product collection. Another

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.990
uh for the product collection. Another thing you can uh assign products using

01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000
thing you can uh assign products using

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.790
thing you can uh assign products using this uh filter. I will uh pick up field

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800
this uh filter. I will uh pick up field

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.350
this uh filter. I will uh pick up field condition that pick up product ID is uh

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360
condition that pick up product ID is uh

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.550
condition that pick up product ID is uh greater than

01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560
greater than

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.510
greater than uh greater than 10. Okay. Preview

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520
uh greater than 10. Okay. Preview

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.110
uh greater than 10. Okay. Preview results.

01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120
results.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.430
results. So I have assigned the whole collection

01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440
So I have assigned the whole collection

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.629
So I have assigned the whole collection of products using uh this uh filter by

01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639
of products using uh this uh filter by

01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:59.110
of products using uh this uh filter by ID and here are all the products which

01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120
ID and here are all the products which

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.669
ID and here are all the products which has ID greater than 10. And you can

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679
has ID greater than 10. And you can

01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:04.550
has ID greater than 10. And you can actually use any fields like uh not ID

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560
actually use any fields like uh not ID

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.270
actually use any fields like uh not ID but some specific flag or attribute here

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280
but some specific flag or attribute here

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.390
but some specific flag or attribute here for for filtering products.

01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400
for for filtering products.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.790
for for filtering products. And uh after we have selected we can

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800
And uh after we have selected we can

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.709
And uh after we have selected we can specify the sort order uh and so on like

01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719
specify the sort order uh and so on like

01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:20.790
specify the sort order uh and so on like similar we had for the

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800
similar we had for the

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.030
similar we had for the uh for the category. I will save the

01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040
uh for the category. I will save the

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.590
uh for the category. I will save the changes.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.910
So we have the same favorite products

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920
So we have the same favorite products

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.550
So we have the same favorite products but now it is a product collection which

01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560
but now it is a product collection which

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.310
but now it is a product collection which has a collection of uh 57 records. And

01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320
has a collection of uh 57 records. And

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.270
has a collection of uh 57 records. And please notice that uh under the hood

01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280
please notice that uh under the hood

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.550
please notice that uh under the hood when we were selecting um not selecting

01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560
when we were selecting um not selecting

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.510
when we were selecting um not selecting but defining this filter under the hood

01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520
but defining this filter under the hood

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:49.270
but defining this filter under the hood uh a segment uh with this filter values

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280
uh a segment uh with this filter values

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.790
uh a segment uh with this filter values was created with some hash values uh

01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800
was created with some hash values uh

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.229
was created with some hash values uh here. So product collections they are

01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239
here. So product collections they are

01:29:56.239 --> 01:29:58.790
here. So product collections they are relying on segments and the way you

01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800
relying on segments and the way you

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.590
relying on segments and the way you specify the segment either creating

01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600
specify the segment either creating

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.070
specify the segment either creating manually from reports and segments or

01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080
manually from reports and segments or

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.310
manually from reports and segments or from here it does not actually really

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320
from here it does not actually really

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.910
from here it does not actually really matters. Okay let's check how it works.

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920
matters. Okay let's check how it works.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.390
matters. Okay let's check how it works. Uh now I will go to products favorite

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400
Uh now I will go to products favorite

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.669
Uh now I will go to products favorite products.

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:22.550
Okay I have uh click products favorite

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560
Okay I have uh click products favorite

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.669
Okay I have uh click products favorite products. I have landed to this uh to

01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679
products. I have landed to this uh to

01:30:25.679 --> 01:30:28.629
products. I have landed to this uh to this page. So 57 remember products were

01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639
this page. So 57 remember products were

01:30:28.639 --> 01:30:31.189
this page. So 57 remember products were assigned. I guess some of them uh like

01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199
assigned. I guess some of them uh like

01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:34.070
assigned. I guess some of them uh like two of them are disabled. Uh that's why

01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080
two of them are disabled. Uh that's why

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:39.510
two of them are disabled. Uh that's why we we see only 55. Um I'm pretty sure

01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520
we we see only 55. Um I'm pretty sure

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.750
we we see only 55. Um I'm pretty sure uh and we have a collection of products

01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760
uh and we have a collection of products

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:52.390
uh and we have a collection of products which we've specified here.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.950
Oh, maybe some of them were uh these are

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960
Oh, maybe some of them were uh these are

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.350
Oh, maybe some of them were uh these are test products which are I guess not

01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360
test products which are I guess not

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.189
test products which are I guess not listed uh for configurable. Yeah. Uh so

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199
listed uh for configurable. Yeah. Uh so

01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:03.270
listed uh for configurable. Yeah. Uh so we have all of them but remember we are

01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280
we have all of them but remember we are

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.950
we have all of them but remember we are not displaying uh varants of

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960
not displaying uh varants of

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.709
not displaying uh varants of configurable products. That's why we are

01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719
configurable products. That's why we are

01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:10.390
configurable products. That's why we are missing these two test one and test two.

01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400
missing these two test one and test two.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.310
missing these two test one and test two. Uh so we can actually use uh filters. We

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320
Uh so we can actually use uh filters. We

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.669
Uh so we can actually use uh filters. We can add manually some specific product.

01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679
can add manually some specific product.

01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:20.470
can add manually some specific product. Let's pick up uh for instance this tech

01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480
Let's pick up uh for instance this tech

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.510
Let's pick up uh for instance this tech one manually. We can also exclude some

01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520
one manually. We can also exclude some

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.390
one manually. We can also exclude some products from the list. For instance, I

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400
products from the list. For instance, I

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.550
products from the list. For instance, I would not like this all these products.

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560
would not like this all these products.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.149
would not like this all these products. I would like to exclude them from the

01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159
I would like to exclude them from the

01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:31.990
I would like to exclude them from the list.

01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000
list.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.149
list. Okay.

01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159
Okay.

01:31:34.159 --> 01:31:36.470
Okay. And now I have like a final result

01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480
And now I have like a final result

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.870
And now I have like a final result should be 40

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880
should be 40

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.310
should be 40 48. I will save the changes.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.310
I will refresh the page and I have uh 48

01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320
I will refresh the page and I have uh 48

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.070
I will refresh the page and I have uh 48 products of this collection.

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080
products of this collection.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.350
products of this collection. of this product collection.

01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360
of this product collection.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.030
of this product collection. So uh product collection uh within a

01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040
So uh product collection uh within a

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.990
So uh product collection uh within a product collection we can assign u same

01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000
product collection we can assign u same

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.790
product collection we can assign u same product to different uh web catalog

01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800
product to different uh web catalog

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.030
product to different uh web catalog nodes and this is how you can achieve

01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040
nodes and this is how you can achieve

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.950
nodes and this is how you can achieve that uh product will appear in different

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960
that uh product will appear in different

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.590
that uh product will appear in different uh in different categories of your web

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600
uh in different categories of your web

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.470
uh in different categories of your web catalog. uh they could be assigned

01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480
catalog. uh they could be assigned

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.510
catalog. uh they could be assigned manually or they could be assigned uh

01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520
manually or they could be assigned uh

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.470
manually or they could be assigned uh using those filters that I've just uh

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480
using those filters that I've just uh

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.629
using those filters that I've just uh demonstrated but under the hood uh this

01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639
demonstrated but under the hood uh this

01:32:26.639 --> 01:32:29.189
demonstrated but under the hood uh this collection uses segments engine. So

01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199
collection uses segments engine. So

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:31.990
collection uses segments engine. So under the hood segment is generated and

01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000
under the hood segment is generated and

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.110
under the hood segment is generated and simply used for the for the collection

01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120
simply used for the for the collection

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.629
simply used for the for the collection and uh yeah you can use exclusions

01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639
and uh yeah you can use exclusions

01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:41.830
and uh yeah you can use exclusions manual selections and keep in mind so

01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840
manual selections and keep in mind so

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.310
manual selections and keep in mind so this is not uh while you are assigning

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320
this is not uh while you are assigning

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.990
this is not uh while you are assigning products uh uh

01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000
products uh uh

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.390
products uh uh within product collections to the web

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400
within product collections to the web

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.950
within product collections to the web catalog categories you are not

01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960
catalog categories you are not

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.189
catalog categories you are not introducing this is not like done from

01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199
introducing this is not like done from

01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:58.790
introducing this is not like done from uh by product uh many to

01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800
uh by product uh many to

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.110
uh by product uh many to uh categories relation but rather

01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120
uh categories relation but rather

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.790
uh categories relation but rather through this segments engine.

01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800
through this segments engine.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:08.870
through this segments engine. Okay. The next thing is uh a category

01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880
Okay. The next thing is uh a category

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.110
Okay. The next thing is uh a category variant. So we may have assigned some

01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120
variant. So we may have assigned some

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.270
variant. So we may have assigned some specific collection. On the other hand

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280
specific collection. On the other hand

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.270
specific collection. On the other hand side you may just simply uh assign some

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280
side you may just simply uh assign some

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:25.110
side you may just simply uh assign some uh category of master uh catalog. So

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120
uh category of master uh catalog. So

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.790
uh category of master uh catalog. So imagine I would like for favorite

01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800
imagine I would like for favorite

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.870

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480
from the lightning products uh category

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.510
from the lightning products uh category because I am using a content variant uh

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520
because I am using a content variant uh

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.189
because I am using a content variant uh named category. There is an option to uh

01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199
named category. There is an option to uh

01:34:09.199 --> 01:34:12.149
named category. There is an option to uh either include subcategories or just

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800
users will see or should see uh this uh

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:02.550
users will see or should see uh this uh product and you can add as many uh

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560
product and you can add as many uh

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.709
product and you can add as many uh variants as you would like and specify

01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719
variants as you would like and specify

01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:06.390
variants as you would like and specify depending on group website and

01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400
depending on group website and

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:12.149
depending on group website and localization. I will save the changes.

01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:14.790
So we have two variants. One variant is

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800
So we have two variants. One variant is

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.669
So we have two variants. One variant is default and another one is product

01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679
default and another one is product

01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:20.950
default and another one is product details page which is for company A.

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960
details page which is for company A.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.270
details page which is for company A. Let's check.

01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280
Let's check.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.790
Let's check. Okay. So I will go to product. Oops. Uh

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800
Okay. So I will go to product. Oops. Uh

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.470
Okay. So I will go to product. Oops. Uh product favorite products. I am still on

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480
product favorite products. I am still on

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.390
product favorite products. I am still on about uh landing page which is a default

01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400
about uh landing page which is a default

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.390
about uh landing page which is a default one. Now let me sign in as a company a

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400
one. Now let me sign in as a company a

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.910
one. Now let me sign in as a company a user which is Amanda. Navigate to

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920
user which is Amanda. Navigate to

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.750
user which is Amanda. Navigate to favorite products and instead of seeing

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760
favorite products and instead of seeing

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.270
favorite products and instead of seeing uh variant uh from landing page I am

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280
uh variant uh from landing page I am

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.910
uh variant uh from landing page I am seeing uh PDP product details page from

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920
seeing uh PDP product details page from

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.470
seeing uh PDP product details page from the product I have just uh specified

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480
the product I have just uh specified

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.310
the product I have just uh specified this uh foldable uh wheelchair.

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320
this uh foldable uh wheelchair.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.149
this uh foldable uh wheelchair. So this is how we can manage and uh uh

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159
So this is how we can manage and uh uh

01:39:02.159 --> 01:39:05.350
So this is how we can manage and uh uh manage what kind of content to present

01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360
manage what kind of content to present

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.750
manage what kind of content to present depending on

01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760
depending on

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.470
depending on um on customer customer group and uh

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480
um on customer customer group and uh

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:20.070
um on customer customer group and uh website and localization.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.109
So talking about the differences um from

01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119
So talking about the differences um from

01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:25.910
So talking about the differences um from one hand side we have checked what kind

01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920
one hand side we have checked what kind

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.590
one hand side we have checked what kind of master catalog how it looks like and

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600
of master catalog how it looks like and

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.270
of master catalog how it looks like and on the other hand side we have checked

01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280
on the other hand side we have checked

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.470
on the other hand side we have checked web catalog and here is the table which

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480
web catalog and here is the table which

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.189
web catalog and here is the table which uh explains the difference describes the

01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199
uh explains the difference describes the

01:39:37.199 --> 01:39:39.109
uh explains the difference describes the difference between these two uh

01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119
difference between these two uh

01:39:39.119 --> 01:39:41.590
difference between these two uh concepts. When we were talking about

01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600
concepts. When we were talking about

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.390
concepts. When we were talking about master catalog, we have checked that we

01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400
master catalog, we have checked that we

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.510
master catalog, we have checked that we can have only one instance of uh master

01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520
can have only one instance of uh master

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.189
can have only one instance of uh master catalog and products are categorized

01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199
catalog and products are categorized

01:39:51.199 --> 01:39:55.030
catalog and products are categorized depending on it. Uh while with a web

01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040
depending on it. Uh while with a web

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.990
depending on it. Uh while with a web catalog we may have multiple web

01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000
catalog we may have multiple web

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.629
catalog we may have multiple web cataloges and then assign those web

01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639
cataloges and then assign those web

01:40:00.639 --> 01:40:03.430
cataloges and then assign those web cataloges uh depending on a for

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440
cataloges uh depending on a for

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.990
cataloges uh depending on a for different websites.

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000
different websites.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.750
different websites. uh when we were talking about product

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760
uh when we were talking about product

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.070
uh when we were talking about product association so single product was

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080
association so single product was

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.870
association so single product was assigned to one category uh

01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880
assigned to one category uh

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.629
assigned to one category uh of master uh catalog while within a web

01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639
of master uh catalog while within a web

01:40:18.639 --> 01:40:22.470
of master uh catalog while within a web catalog we were able to u assign product

01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480
catalog we were able to u assign product

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.950
catalog we were able to u assign product to different collections. So product

01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960
to different collections. So product

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.430
to different collections. So product then will appear in different in

01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440
then will appear in different in

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.270
then will appear in different in multiple uh categories of web catalog.

01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280
multiple uh categories of web catalog.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.470
multiple uh categories of web catalog. Uh then with visibility restrictions uh

01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480
Uh then with visibility restrictions uh

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:40.790
Uh then with visibility restrictions uh u if we are restricting u uh restricting

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800
u if we are restricting u uh restricting

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.830
u if we are restricting u uh restricting making hidden uh some web catalog it uh

01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840
making hidden uh some web catalog it uh

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.390
making hidden uh some web catalog it uh web catalog category it will influence

01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400
web catalog category it will influence

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.870
web catalog category it will influence on visibility of the product. So product

01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880
on visibility of the product. So product

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.229
on visibility of the product. So product becomes available user will see 404.

01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239
becomes available user will see 404.

01:40:54.239 --> 01:40:56.870
becomes available user will see 404. While with a web catalog the restriction

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880
While with a web catalog the restriction

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.270
While with a web catalog the restriction they do not affect products product will

01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280
they do not affect products product will

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.550
they do not affect products product will still be available. Uh what is u

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560
still be available. Uh what is u

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.149
still be available. Uh what is u restricted is the content uh content of

01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159
restricted is the content uh content of

01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:10.149
restricted is the content uh content of the uh web catalog. Remember we were

01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159
the uh web catalog. Remember we were

01:41:10.159 --> 01:41:13.750
the uh web catalog. Remember we were changing like in the in the example I

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760
changing like in the in the example I

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.109
changing like in the in the example I have just demonstrated we have

01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119
have just demonstrated we have

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:18.709
have just demonstrated we have restricted the content for all users. it

01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719
restricted the content for all users. it

01:41:18.719 --> 01:41:22.870
restricted the content for all users. it was uh like a landing page but for uh

01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880
was uh like a landing page but for uh

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.669
was uh like a landing page but for uh for others it was uh for company it was

01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679
for others it was uh for company it was

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:28.390
for others it was uh for company it was PDP. So we are just restricting content

01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400
PDP. So we are just restricting content

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.750
PDP. So we are just restricting content but not the product itself. And uh

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760
but not the product itself. And uh

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.270
but not the product itself. And uh within a master catalog we have uh this

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280
within a master catalog we have uh this

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.790
within a master catalog we have uh this restrictions

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800
restrictions

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.229
restrictions uh could be we can set up uh the

01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239
uh could be we can set up uh the

01:41:40.239 --> 01:41:43.590
uh could be we can set up uh the fallbacks uh so that the restrictions uh

01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600
fallbacks uh so that the restrictions uh

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.310
fallbacks uh so that the restrictions uh uh visibility restrictions are taken

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320
uh visibility restrictions are taken

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.229
uh visibility restrictions are taken based on global configuration website uh

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239
based on global configuration website uh

01:41:50.239 --> 01:41:52.310
based on global configuration website uh configuration. This is for the product

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320
configuration. This is for the product

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.870
configuration. This is for the product uh customer group levels. While for the

01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880
uh customer group levels. While for the

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.109
uh customer group levels. While for the web catalog there is no fallbacks uh

01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119
web catalog there is no fallbacks uh

01:41:57.119 --> 01:42:00.709
web catalog there is no fallbacks uh just uh plain settings uh here depending

01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719
just uh plain settings uh here depending

01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:03.910
just uh plain settings uh here depending on room customer website that's it no

01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920
on room customer website that's it no

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.830
on room customer website that's it no fallbacks. So these are the differences

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840
fallbacks. So these are the differences

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.629
fallbacks. So these are the differences between uh master catalog and web

01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639
between uh master catalog and web

01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:12.629
between uh master catalog and web catalog.

01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639
catalog.

01:42:12.639 --> 01:42:16.149
catalog. Uh so if uh there is a need to u to

01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159
Uh so if uh there is a need to u to

01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:18.470
Uh so if uh there is a need to u to apply some customizations related to web

01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480
apply some customizations related to web

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.030
apply some customizations related to web catalog. So we have this

01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040
catalog. So we have this

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.990
catalog. So we have this request web content uh variant provider.

01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000
request web content uh variant provider.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.590
request web content uh variant provider. Uh in some cases it is used um it simply

01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600
Uh in some cases it is used um it simply

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.950
Uh in some cases it is used um it simply knows on what uh what kind of content

01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960
knows on what uh what kind of content

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.109
knows on what uh what kind of content variant uh to provide and um yeah it

01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119
variant uh to provide and um yeah it

01:42:35.119 --> 01:42:38.149
variant uh to provide and um yeah it checks uh stores this value in request.

01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159
checks uh stores this value in request.

01:42:38.159 --> 01:42:40.950
checks uh stores this value in request. You can then reuse uh in your templates

01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960
You can then reuse uh in your templates

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.669
You can then reuse uh in your templates for instance uh to provide some specific

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679
for instance uh to provide some specific

01:42:43.679 --> 01:42:47.350
for instance uh to provide some specific u uh specific information.

01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360
u uh specific information.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.390
u uh specific information. Uh yeah, this is an example how this

01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400
Uh yeah, this is an example how this

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.229
Uh yeah, this is an example how this provider is used especially for the

01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239
provider is used especially for the

01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:55.030
provider is used especially for the breadcrumbs

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040
breadcrumbs

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.830
breadcrumbs crumbs and some user guide example how

01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840
crumbs and some user guide example how

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.669
crumbs and some user guide example how to create web catalog and so on. Uh so

01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679
to create web catalog and so on. Uh so

01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:06.070
to create web catalog and so on. Uh so whenever you will be starting or

01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080
whenever you will be starting or

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.790
whenever you will be starting or building a project using a commerce

01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800
building a project using a commerce

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.070
building a project using a commerce think ahead. Uh so in some cases uh

01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080
think ahead. Uh so in some cases uh

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.229
think ahead. Uh so in some cases uh master catalog would be enough. So you

01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239
master catalog would be enough. So you

01:43:14.239 --> 01:43:16.790
master catalog would be enough. So you just categorize your products uh uh

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800
just categorize your products uh uh

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.109
just categorize your products uh uh using master catalog using master

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119
using master catalog using master

01:43:19.119 --> 01:43:21.510
using master catalog using master catalog and that's it. While on the

01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520
catalog and that's it. While on the

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.270
catalog and that's it. While on the other hand side in some cases you would

01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280
other hand side in some cases you would

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.669
other hand side in some cases you would like to provide better user experience

01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679
like to provide better user experience

01:43:25.679 --> 01:43:27.750
like to provide better user experience then you introduce a web catalog then

01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760
then you introduce a web catalog then

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.390
then you introduce a web catalog then you introduce some specific uh uh

01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400
you introduce some specific uh uh

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.149
you introduce some specific uh uh restrictions uh depending on users

01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159
restrictions uh depending on users

01:43:34.159 --> 01:43:37.990
restrictions uh depending on users specific content uh uh yeah using this

01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000
specific content uh uh yeah using this

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.629
specific content uh uh yeah using this uh web catalog. But anyway they could be

01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639
uh web catalog. But anyway they could be

01:43:40.639 --> 01:43:43.109
uh web catalog. But anyway they could be used both could be used together web

01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119
used both could be used together web

01:43:43.119 --> 01:43:46.310
used both could be used together web catalog and master catalog.

01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320
catalog and master catalog.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.270
catalog and master catalog. And uh if you are using uh product

01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280
And uh if you are using uh product

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.270
And uh if you are using uh product collection uh please do not use with a

01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280
collection uh please do not use with a

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.709
collection uh please do not use with a huge amount of uh products do not assign

01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719
huge amount of uh products do not assign

01:43:56.719 --> 01:43:57.910
huge amount of uh products do not assign because you may face with some

01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920
because you may face with some

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.669
because you may face with some performance issues. better to reuse uh

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679
performance issues. better to reuse uh

01:44:01.679 --> 01:44:05.109
performance issues. better to reuse uh master catalog categories uh to to

01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119
master catalog categories uh to to

01:44:05.119 --> 01:44:07.910
master catalog categories uh to to assign to a collection based on the

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920
assign to a collection based on the

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.470
assign to a collection based on the master catalog categories you will have

01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480
master catalog categories you will have

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.350
master catalog categories you will have like a better performance with it.

01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360
like a better performance with it.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.350
like a better performance with it. Uh that's it what I wanted to

01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360
Uh that's it what I wanted to

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.830
Uh that's it what I wanted to demonstrate related to web catalog. Now

01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840
demonstrate related to web catalog. Now

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.189
demonstrate related to web catalog. Now Q&amp;A.

01:44:23.199 --> 01:44:26.310
Okay, we have few questions. Uh why I

01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320
Okay, we have few questions. Uh why I

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.550
Okay, we have few questions. Uh why I cannot add multi select product

01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560
cannot add multi select product

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.430
cannot add multi select product attributes to attribute set?

01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440
attributes to attribute set?

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.030
attributes to attribute set? Uh

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.030
is this a question related to

01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040
is this a question related to

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.870
is this a question related to configuration? U configurable products

01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880
configuration? U configurable products

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.030
configuration? U configurable products multi select product attribute to

01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040
multi select product attribute to

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.350
multi select product attribute to attribute set.

01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360
attribute set.

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.950
attribute set. Okay. Figure out. Okay. Certainly. Yeah.

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960
Okay. Figure out. Okay. Certainly. Yeah.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.669
Okay. Figure out. Okay. Certainly. Yeah. No worries.

01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679
No worries.

01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:53.510
No worries. Ah, sure. Yeah. I have not read. Yeah.

01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520
Ah, sure. Yeah. I have not read. Yeah.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.790
Ah, sure. Yeah. I have not read. Yeah. So whenever you're introducing uh using

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800
So whenever you're introducing uh using

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.390
So whenever you're introducing uh using uh entity management uh

01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400
uh entity management uh

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.350
uh entity management uh this entity management uh whenever you

01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360
this entity management uh whenever you

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.070
this entity management uh whenever you are adding some updates uh then you will

01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080
are adding some updates uh then you will

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.390
are adding some updates uh then you will have uh to update schema if you are

01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400
have uh to update schema if you are

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.709
have uh to update schema if you are running u

01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719
running u

01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:13.189
running u so these changes then should be

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199
so these changes then should be

01:45:13.199 --> 01:45:15.750
so these changes then should be performed and

01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760
performed and

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.470
performed and uh reflected uh on the uh entity

01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480
uh reflected uh on the uh entity

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.990
uh reflected uh on the uh entity on the entity level

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000
on the entity level

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.750
on the entity level Yeah, for that there would be a red

01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760
Yeah, for that there would be a red

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.470
Yeah, for that there would be a red button update schema if you are doing

01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480
button update schema if you are doing

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.750
button update schema if you are doing this uh using migration. So it will be

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760
this uh using migration. So it will be

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.310
this uh using migration. So it will be performed uh during upgrade process.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.990
Is there some rules around how

01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000
Is there some rules around how

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.229
Is there some rules around how attributes get stored? Will they always

01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239
attributes get stored? Will they always

01:45:42.239 --> 01:45:44.629
attributes get stored? Will they always get stored as a table column or sometime

01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639
get stored as a table column or sometime

01:45:44.639 --> 01:45:47.350
get stored as a table column or sometime be serialized? Yeah. So there is an

01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360
be serialized? Yeah. So there is an

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.109
be serialized? Yeah. So there is an explanation in what cases um uh you can

01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119
explanation in what cases um uh you can

01:45:51.119 --> 01:45:54.709
explanation in what cases um uh you can use serialized fields um serialized

01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719
use serialized fields um serialized

01:45:54.719 --> 01:45:58.149
use serialized fields um serialized field but not uh

01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159
field but not uh

01:45:58.159 --> 01:46:01.189
field but not uh or serialized

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199
or serialized

01:46:01.199 --> 01:46:05.109
or serialized but not as column um

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119
but not as column um

01:46:05.119 --> 01:46:07.270
but not as column um there was a good example serialized

01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280
there was a good example serialized

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.790
there was a good example serialized fields.

01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800
fields.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.590
fields. Yep. Here you are.

01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600
Yep. Here you are.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.950
Yep. Here you are. Uh so this is an explanation by the way

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960
Uh so this is an explanation by the way

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.030
Uh so this is an explanation by the way it was introduced uh not so long ago and

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040
it was introduced uh not so long ago and

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.030
it was introduced uh not so long ago and there are some limitations for this uh

01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040
there are some limitations for this uh

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.149
there are some limitations for this uh for these fields and what kind of types

01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159
for these fields and what kind of types

01:46:24.159 --> 01:46:25.910
for these fields and what kind of types are supported for this serialized

01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920
are supported for this serialized

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.390
are supported for this serialized fields. Please refer to this for

01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400
fields. Please refer to this for

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.629
fields. Please refer to this for for more information

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639
for more information

01:46:32.639 --> 01:46:34.390
for more information according to your specific case you

01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400
according to your specific case you

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:35.590
according to your specific case you would like to achieve.

01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600
would like to achieve.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.310
would like to achieve. Yeah. So

01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320
Yeah. So

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:36.870
Yeah. So so

01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880
so

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.470
so if there is an ability please use it.

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480
if there is an ability please use it.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.189
if there is an ability please use it. Yes. Will product attributes created

01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199
Yes. Will product attributes created

01:46:41.199 --> 01:46:43.270
Yes. Will product attributes created through the back office or through

01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280
through the back office or through

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.109
through the back office or through migrations always be stored in table

01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119
migrations always be stored in table

01:46:45.119 --> 01:46:47.990
migrations always be stored in table columns or is there

01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000
columns or is there

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.550
columns or is there could a productized

01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560
could a productized

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.189
could a productized within within serialized fields you you

01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199
within within serialized fields you you

01:46:53.199 --> 01:46:55.990
within within serialized fields you you should you would not need to perform uh

01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000
should you would not need to perform uh

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.070
should you would not need to perform uh uh schema migration um schema updates

01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080
uh schema migration um schema updates

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.030
uh schema migration um schema updates uh so they will be used store it in this

01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040
uh so they will be used store it in this

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.669
uh so they will be used store it in this serialized data field which under the

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679
serialized data field which under the

01:47:05.679 --> 01:47:07.510
serialized data field which under the hood will be like you know object or

01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520
hood will be like you know object or

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.149
hood will be like you know object or array Uh yeah, that's why no need.

01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159
array Uh yeah, that's why no need.

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:14.149
array Uh yeah, that's why no need. But only when I'm creating a field will

01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159
But only when I'm creating a field will

01:47:14.159 --> 01:47:16.070
But only when I'm creating a field will I be able to pick serialized. If I

01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080
I be able to pick serialized. If I

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.310
I be able to pick serialized. If I create an attribute, it'll always be a

01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320
create an attribute, it'll always be a

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:20.470
create an attribute, it'll always be a table column.

01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480
table column.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:20.950
table column. Correct.

01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960
Correct.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.470
Correct. It seems like Mhm. Yes.

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480
It seems like Mhm. Yes.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.750
It seems like Mhm. Yes. Okay.

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.510
Okay.

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520
Okay.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.149
Okay. Then let's take 10 minutes break and

01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159
Then let's take 10 minutes break and

01:47:34.159 --> 01:47:37.990
Then let's take 10 minutes break and we are a bit out of uh schedule with the

01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000
we are a bit out of uh schedule with the

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.149
we are a bit out of uh schedule with the time u and let's continue with the

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159
time u and let's continue with the

01:47:40.159 --> 01:47:43.350
time u and let's continue with the pricing u too much topics to discuss

01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360
pricing u too much topics to discuss

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:46.950
pricing u too much topics to discuss today uh pricing so 10 minutes break and

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960
today uh pricing so 10 minutes break and

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:54.229
today uh pricing so 10 minutes break and let's continue then

01:47:54.239 --> 01:47:56.070
so

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080
so

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.870
so we have checked uh how products could be

01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880
we have checked uh how products could be

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:01.990
we have checked uh how products could be set how we can assign products to master

01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000
set how we can assign products to master

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.790
set how we can assign products to master catalog to web catalog. Now the question

01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800
catalog to web catalog. Now the question

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.990
catalog to web catalog. Now the question is how to set up prices for those

01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000
is how to set up prices for those

up uh flexible prices depending on uh

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.149
up uh flexible prices depending on uh different uh scopes of data like u

01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159
different uh scopes of data like u

01:48:58.159 --> 01:49:00.149
different uh scopes of data like u depending on a website depending on the

01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159
depending on a website depending on the

01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:03.430

which are navigating the website. Another thing that uh you can uh assign

01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560
Another thing that uh you can uh assign

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.470
Another thing that uh you can uh assign prices or you can define prices not only

01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480
prices or you can define prices not only

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.030
prices or you can define prices not only manually but also automatically. So

01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040
manually but also automatically. So

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.750
manually but also automatically. So whenever some change is performed over

01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760
whenever some change is performed over

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.709

the product uh uh or new product is

01:49:22.719 --> 01:49:25.990
the product uh uh or new product is added the price is generated by

01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000
added the price is generated by

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.270
added the price is generated by automatically by some uh rules and some

01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280
automatically by some uh rules and some

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.750
automatically by some uh rules and some conditions. Uh there is also an ability

01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760

period of time amount of time

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.629
period of time amount of time uh using uh schedules and we will check

01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639
uh using uh schedules and we will check

01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:49.030
uh using uh schedules and we will check that and uh uh there is an ability to

01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040
that and uh uh there is an ability to

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.030
that and uh uh there is an ability to specify automatic uh prices while on the

01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.629
specify automatic uh prices while on the other hand side uh override with some

01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639
other hand side uh override with some

01:49:56.639 --> 01:49:58.950
other hand side uh override with some manual changes. We will check that as

01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960
manual changes. We will check that as

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.430
manual changes. We will check that as well. If we are talking about prices, it

01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440
well. If we are talking about prices, it

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.149
well. If we are talking about prices, it includes like following

01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159
includes like following

01:50:04.159 --> 01:50:07.669
includes like following components. U currencies,

01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679
components. U currencies,

01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:12.070
components. U currencies, uh product prices, uh then price lists,

01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080
uh product prices, uh then price lists,

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.030
uh product prices, uh then price lists, uh this is the place where actually uh

01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040
uh this is the place where actually uh

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.030
uh this is the place where actually uh product prices are stored. Uh then price

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040
product prices are stored. Uh then price

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.390
product prices are stored. Uh then price attributes. Uh we will check it. Um

01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400
attributes. Uh we will check it. Um

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.910
attributes. Uh we will check it. Um another thing is um how

01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920
another thing is um how

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.550
another thing is um how prices are

01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560
prices are

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.149
prices are um combined and final prices are uh

01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159
um combined and final prices are uh

01:50:34.159 --> 01:50:37.109
um combined and final prices are uh provided for the end user is using this

01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119
provided for the end user is using this

01:50:37.119 --> 01:50:39.830
provided for the end user is using this so-called pricing strategy. So we have

01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840
so-called pricing strategy. So we have

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.390
so-called pricing strategy. So we have two of them. We will check how it works.

01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400
two of them. We will check how it works.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.910
two of them. We will check how it works. And we have u the

01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920
And we have u the

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.790
And we have u the uh layer which is responsible for uh

01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800
uh layer which is responsible for uh

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.669
uh layer which is responsible for uh assigning uh products uh to the price

01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679
assigning uh products uh to the price

01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:54.470
assigning uh products uh to the price list and doing some uh price

01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480
list and doing some uh price

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.709
list and doing some uh price calculation. Uh and this is uh mainly

01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719
calculation. Uh and this is uh mainly

01:50:58.719 --> 01:51:04.070
calculation. Uh and this is uh mainly for some automatic u price calculations.

01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080
for some automatic u price calculations.

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.470
for some automatic u price calculations. Let's start with the first item which is

01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480
Let's start with the first item which is

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:09.510
Let's start with the first item which is currencies. So currency itself it

01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520
currencies. So currency itself it

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.470
currencies. So currency itself it contains as an entity or is a as a

01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480
contains as an entity or is a as a

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.950
contains as an entity or is a as a record it contains of the name code

01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960
record it contains of the name code

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.270
record it contains of the name code symbol. We might have multiple

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280
symbol. We might have multiple

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:20.629
symbol. We might have multiple currencies. U in enterprise edition. Uh

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639
currencies. U in enterprise edition. Uh

01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:22.709
currencies. U in enterprise edition. Uh while in community we will have single

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719
while in community we will have single

01:51:22.719 --> 01:51:24.870
while in community we will have single currency. Uh there is an ability to

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880
currency. Uh there is an ability to

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.030
currency. Uh there is an ability to specify exchange rates between

01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040
specify exchange rates between

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.950
specify exchange rates between currencies and uh um there should be set

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960
currencies and uh um there should be set

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.990
currencies and uh um there should be set up like one uh base currency for that.

01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000
up like one uh base currency for that.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.350
up like one uh base currency for that. Let's uh start with the

01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360
Let's uh start with the

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.229
Let's uh start with the uh back office.

01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239
uh back office.

01:51:40.239 --> 01:51:43.669
uh back office. Check how it works.

01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679
Check how it works.

01:51:43.679 --> 01:51:45.669
Check how it works. How it is presented there. Currencies I

01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679
How it is presented there. Currencies I

01:51:45.679 --> 01:51:53.030
How it is presented there. Currencies I mean. So under system configuration

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.750
we have currency

01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760

switch will appear. This is something we've seen um while checking websites.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.070
Okay, we have a currency

01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080
Okay, we have a currency

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.470
Okay, we have a currency and we have some exchange rates for

01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480
and we have some exchange rates for

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.390
and we have some exchange rates for internal needs. Then we have a product

01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400
internal needs. Then we have a product

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.750
internal needs. Then we have a product price. Product price its definition

01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760
price. Product price its definition

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:56.709
price. Product price its definition contains of uh following uh items. This

01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719
contains of uh following uh items. This

01:54:56.719 --> 01:54:59.830
contains of uh following uh items. This is a product to which this price uh

01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840
is a product to which this price uh

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.070
is a product to which this price uh belongs to uh a price list in which uh

01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080
belongs to uh a price list in which uh

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.910
belongs to uh a price list in which uh this price is defined for which quantity

01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920
this price is defined for which quantity

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.709
this price is defined for which quantity uh for which uh unit of measure.

01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719
uh for which uh unit of measure.

01:55:10.719 --> 01:55:13.669
uh for which uh unit of measure. Remember we might be selling in items in

01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679
Remember we might be selling in items in

01:55:13.679 --> 01:55:16.790
Remember we might be selling in items in sets. That's why we would need to have a

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800
sets. That's why we would need to have a

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.830
sets. That's why we would need to have a price depending on a unit. Then a

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840
price depending on a unit. Then a

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.070
price depending on a unit. Then a currency that's obvious. So we might be

01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080
currency that's obvious. So we might be

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.950
currency that's obvious. So we might be selling in uh

01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960
selling in uh

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.709
selling in uh uh

01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719
uh

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:29.750
uh US dollars in uh euros that's why

01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760
US dollars in uh euros that's why

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.750
US dollars in uh euros that's why currency should also be taken into

01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760
currency should also be taken into

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.430
currency should also be taken into account and actual the price value uh

01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440
account and actual the price value uh

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.149
account and actual the price value uh the amount of money to charge customer

01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159
the amount of money to charge customer

01:55:38.159 --> 01:55:42.229
the amount of money to charge customer for the product. So with that we have uh

01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239
for the product. So with that we have uh

01:55:42.239 --> 01:55:45.109
for the product. So with that we have uh this uh product price list quantity and

01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119
this uh product price list quantity and

01:55:45.119 --> 01:55:47.270
this uh product price list quantity and unit and currency should we should have

01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280
unit and currency should we should have

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.669
unit and currency should we should have like a unique combination of it. We

01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679
like a unique combination of it. We

01:55:49.679 --> 01:55:51.510
like a unique combination of it. We could not have like for the same

01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520
could not have like for the same

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:54.629
could not have like for the same product, same priceless, same quantity

01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639
product, same priceless, same quantity

01:55:54.639 --> 01:56:01.350
product, same priceless, same quantity uh the same uh value uh

01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360
uh the same uh value uh

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.030
uh the same uh value uh back office restricts adding prices but

01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040
back office restricts adding prices but

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.910
back office restricts adding prices but having this combination not unique

01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920
having this combination not unique

01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.830
having this combination not unique and uh how prices could be defined I

01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840
and uh how prices could be defined I

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.030
and uh how prices could be defined I will demonstrate. Let's uh actually

01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040
will demonstrate. Let's uh actually

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.350
will demonstrate. Let's uh actually start here.

01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360
start here.

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.229
start here. So if you go to

01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239
So if you go to

01:56:22.239 --> 01:56:24.229
So if you go to the storefront,

01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239
the storefront,

01:56:24.239 --> 01:56:26.629
the storefront, we are navigating the website. We see

01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639
we are navigating the website. We see

01:56:26.639 --> 01:56:29.990
we are navigating the website. We see the prices and specifically the price

01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000
the prices and specifically the price

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.229
the prices and specifically the price for the uh for specific uh currency for

01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239
for the uh for specific uh currency for

01:56:34.239 --> 01:56:37.189
for the uh for specific uh currency for specific unit of quantity

01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199
specific unit of quantity

01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:41.510
specific unit of quantity uh we uh for specific quantity. So these

01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520
uh we uh for specific quantity. So these

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:44.229
uh we uh for specific quantity. So these are so-called tire prices. So depending

01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239
are so-called tire prices. So depending

01:56:44.239 --> 01:56:48.390
are so-called tire prices. So depending on the purchased quantity the price uh

01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400
on the purchased quantity the price uh

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:52.070
on the purchased quantity the price uh value might differ and so just as an

01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080
value might differ and so just as an

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.589
value might differ and so just as an example so if I am purchasing one item

01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599
example so if I am purchasing one item

01:56:55.599 --> 01:56:59.910
example so if I am purchasing one item um this is price 76 while purchasing 11

01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920
um this is price 76 while purchasing 11

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:05.830
um this is price 76 while purchasing 11 items uh it will uh pick up lower price

01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840
items uh it will uh pick up lower price

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.310
items uh it will uh pick up lower price for the for the 10 and more quantity so

01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320
for the for the 10 and more quantity so

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:13.510
for the for the 10 and more quantity so that's why quantity are also taken into

01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520
that's why quantity are also taken into

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.990
that's why quantity are also taken into account for the prices, actual priced

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000
account for the prices, actual priced

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.589
account for the prices, actual priced value and uh so prices are visible on

01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599
value and uh so prices are visible on

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:22.310
value and uh so prices are visible on the product listing page on the product

01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320
the product listing page on the product

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.550
the product listing page on the product uh details page. If we navigate to the

01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560
uh details page. If we navigate to the

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.830
uh details page. If we navigate to the shopping list,

01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840
adding not adding a price right on the

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.229
adding not adding a price right on the product edit page specifying the price

01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239
product edit page specifying the price

01:59:34.239 --> 01:59:36.470
product edit page specifying the price list quantity. So we imagine I will pick

01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480
list quantity. So we imagine I will pick

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.790
list quantity. So we imagine I will pick up the

01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800
up the

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.070
up the uh customer price with a quantity 100

01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080
uh customer price with a quantity 100

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.669
uh customer price with a quantity 100 with a set with the value and for the

01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679
with a set with the value and for the

01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:49.109
with a set with the value and for the yellow robot with another uh value. I

01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119
yellow robot with another uh value. I

01:59:49.119 --> 01:59:51.750
yellow robot with another uh value. I will try to save the changes

01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760
will try to save the changes

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.070
will try to save the changes and it will not allow me to save the

01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080
and it will not allow me to save the

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:58.390
and it will not allow me to save the changes as I have a duplication for this

01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400
changes as I have a duplication for this

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:00.470
changes as I have a duplication for this uh

02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480
uh

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:02.870
uh uh I have not unique combination for the

02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880
uh I have not unique combination for the

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.589
uh I have not unique combination for the priceless quantity unit of um quantity

02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599
priceless quantity unit of um quantity

02:00:07.599 --> 02:00:10.070
priceless quantity unit of um quantity currency and that's why it restricts me

02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080
currency and that's why it restricts me

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:15.109
currency and that's why it restricts me to do this. So I will remove this uh

02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119
to do this. So I will remove this uh

02:00:15.119 --> 02:00:17.669
to do this. So I will remove this uh save the changes.

02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679
save the changes.

02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:19.910
save the changes. So this is option number one how prices

02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920
So this is option number one how prices

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.550
So this is option number one how prices could be defined. Option number two is

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560
could be defined. Option number two is

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.950
could be defined. Option number two is when I go to uh price list that I have

02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960
when I go to uh price list that I have

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:29.189
when I go to uh price list that I have in the system. So I have several of them

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199
in the system. So I have several of them

02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:32.149
in the system. So I have several of them they are assigned to some u on some

02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159
they are assigned to some u on some

02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:34.629
they are assigned to some u on some levels. We will check it. So if I

02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639
levels. We will check it. So if I

02:00:34.639 --> 02:00:37.589
levels. We will check it. So if I navigate to the default price list here

02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599
navigate to the default price list here

02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:40.950
navigate to the default price list here I also able to add uh product price.

02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960
I also able to add uh product price.

02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:44.070
I also able to add uh product price. specify the product, specify the

02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080
specify the product, specify the

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.149
specify the product, specify the quantity,

02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159
quantity,

02:00:46.159 --> 02:00:49.990
quantity, unit and price and it will be uh store

02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000
unit and price and it will be uh store

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.589
unit and price and it will be uh store that. Let's actually add for the

02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599
that. Let's actually add for the

02:00:51.599 --> 02:00:55.669
that. Let's actually add for the quantity five just as an example. Let's

02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679
quantity five just as an example. Let's

02:00:55.679 --> 02:00:59.350
quantity five just as an example. Let's pick uh let's it be

02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360
pick uh let's it be

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.350
pick uh let's it be 90

02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360
90

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.820
90 20

02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:03.830
20

02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:08.229
20 [Music]

02:01:08.239 --> 02:01:12.870
is it using set

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:15.910
Yes. Set. Mhm.

02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920
Yes. Set. Mhm.

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:25.589
Yes. Set. Mhm. Okay. I will save the changes.

02:01:25.599 --> 02:01:29.990
So now I have the prices um updated for

02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000
So now I have the prices um updated for

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.229
So now I have the prices um updated for this product. Now I have the price

02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239
this product. Now I have the price

02:01:32.239 --> 02:01:35.109
this product. Now I have the price specified for another tire uh like for

02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119
specified for another tire uh like for

02:01:35.119 --> 02:01:37.830
specified for another tire uh like for the quantity five like purchasing six

02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840
the quantity five like purchasing six

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.990
the quantity five like purchasing six product will give me the price of uh 20

02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000
product will give me the price of uh 20

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.589
product will give me the price of uh 20 rather than this one or this one. Okay,

02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599
rather than this one or this one. Okay,

02:01:45.599 --> 02:01:47.910
rather than this one or this one. Okay, this is the second thing uh where we can

02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920
this is the second thing uh where we can

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:50.790
this is the second thing uh where we can add prices. Another thing we can uh use

02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800
add prices. Another thing we can uh use

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.589
add prices. Another thing we can uh use import file and within the import file

02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599
import file and within the import file

02:01:53.599 --> 02:01:57.030
import file and within the import file we are downloading a template and then

02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040
we are downloading a template and then

02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.589
we are downloading a template and then there are two options how to add those

02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599
there are two options how to add those

02:01:59.599 --> 02:02:04.310
there are two options how to add those prices either to add or replace existing

02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320
prices either to add or replace existing

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.990
prices either to add or replace existing or simply reset the whole price list and

02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000
or simply reset the whole price list and

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.830
or simply reset the whole price list and populate with those uh uh with those

02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840
populate with those uh uh with those

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.870
populate with those uh uh with those prices uh which were specified in a

02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880
prices uh which were specified in a

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:20.149
prices uh which were specified in a in the uh import file.

02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159
in the uh import file.

02:02:20.159 --> 02:02:22.229
in the uh import file. Okay, this is the second thing how

02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239
Okay, this is the second thing how

02:02:22.239 --> 02:02:25.510
Okay, this is the second thing how prices could be added and yeah let's

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520
prices could be added and yeah let's

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:32.870
prices could be added and yeah let's let's continue.

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:36.390
Now we came to the uh to the term uh

02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400
Now we came to the uh to the term uh

02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:40.310
Now we came to the uh to the term uh called price list. Uh so in a price list

02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320
called price list. Uh so in a price list

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.350
called price list. Uh so in a price list we are defining

02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360
we are defining

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.669
we are defining product prices which are matching by

02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679
product prices which are matching by

02:02:45.679 --> 02:02:49.669
product prices which are matching by quantity uh

02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679
quantity uh

02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:52.950
quantity uh currency um and actually specifies the

02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960
currency um and actually specifies the

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.149
currency um and actually specifies the value of the of the price. uh each price

02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159
value of the of the price. uh each price

02:02:56.159 --> 02:02:59.189
value of the of the price. uh each price list. It could be um a static which

02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199
list. It could be um a static which

02:02:59.199 --> 02:03:02.790
list. It could be um a static which defines like static prices uh per each

02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800
defines like static prices uh per each

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.350
defines like static prices uh per each uh product which is added to the price

02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360
uh product which is added to the price

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.669
uh product which is added to the price list, right? Or it could be

02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679
list, right? Or it could be

02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:09.189
list, right? Or it could be autogenerated

02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199
autogenerated

02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:13.270
autogenerated and autogeneration is um performed based

02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280
and autogeneration is um performed based

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.149
and autogeneration is um performed based on some rules. We will check it. Uh on

02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159
on some rules. We will check it. Uh on

02:03:16.159 --> 02:03:18.070
on some rules. We will check it. Uh on the other hand side, it could be mixed.

02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080
the other hand side, it could be mixed.

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.870
the other hand side, it could be mixed. So we can like autogenerate uh some um

02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880
So we can like autogenerate uh some um

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.229
So we can like autogenerate uh some um uh product uh prices while others could

02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239
uh product uh prices while others could

02:03:26.239 --> 02:03:28.550
uh product uh prices while others could be added manually

02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560
be added manually

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.070
be added manually uh by uh by the back office users and um

02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080
uh by uh by the back office users and um

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.910
uh by uh by the back office users and um they may rely on some uh additional uh

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920
they may rely on some uh additional uh

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.109
they may rely on some uh additional uh indicators like uh product availability,

02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119
indicators like uh product availability,

02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:43.830
indicators like uh product availability, some uh price attributes, some

02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840
some uh price attributes, some

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.910
some uh price attributes, some recommended price and we will check it

02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920
recommended price and we will check it

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.990
recommended price and we will check it in a moment.

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000
in a moment.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.390
in a moment. So if we are creating a price list, it

02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400
So if we are creating a price list, it

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:54.390
So if we are creating a price list, it contains of uh following

02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400
contains of uh following

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.990
contains of uh following properties. Let's go to price list. So

02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000
properties. Let's go to price list. So

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.070
properties. Let's go to price list. So these are located under sales price

02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:00.080
these are located under sales price

02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:08.470
these are located under sales price list. We will create a price list.

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.390
I would need to specify the name of the

02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400
I would need to specify the name of the

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.950
I would need to specify the name of the price list, the currencies for which

02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960
price list, the currencies for which

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:15.910
price list, the currencies for which this uh price list will be uh working

02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920
this uh price list will be uh working

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:19.669
this uh price list will be uh working with. Let's pick up US dollars only

02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679
with. Let's pick up US dollars only

02:04:19.679 --> 02:04:21.510
with. Let's pick up US dollars only whether it should be active or not. So

02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520
whether it should be active or not. So

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.750
whether it should be active or not. So whenever you are working with some u

02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760
whenever you are working with some u

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:27.510
whenever you are working with some u draft prices uh just keep it uh as not

02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520
draft prices uh just keep it uh as not

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.070
draft prices uh just keep it uh as not active and then on the make active when

02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:30.080
active and then on the make active when

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.709
active and then on the make active when the price list should be

02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719
the price list should be

02:04:34.719 --> 02:04:37.510
the price list should be available for the storefront. Then we

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520
available for the storefront. Then we

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:44.709
available for the storefront. Then we have a field for specifying schedules.

02:04:44.719 --> 02:04:47.510
So with that we can uh we can specify in

02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520
So with that we can uh we can specify in

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.550
So with that we can uh we can specify in what period uh this uh particular price

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560
what period uh this uh particular price

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:53.270
what period uh this uh particular price list should be uh should be active and

02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280
list should be uh should be active and

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.109
list should be uh should be active and the prices which are specified in the

02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119
the prices which are specified in the

02:04:55.119 --> 02:04:57.430
the prices which are specified in the price list should be taken into account

02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440
price list should be taken into account

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.629
price list should be taken into account for the final u uh price that customer

final prices which then user will see here in a storefront. They are

02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880
here in a storefront. They are

02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.470
here in a storefront. They are calculated

02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480
calculated

02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:01.270
calculated uh as a background in a background

02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280
uh as a background in a background

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.990
uh as a background in a background background process and actually you

02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000
background process and actually you

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.270
background process and actually you should not uh uh bother on that they are

02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280
should not uh uh bother on that they are

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.030
should not uh uh bother on that they are recalculated but on the other hand side

02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040
recalculated but on the other hand side

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.270
recalculated but on the other hand side we have this uh recalculate button which

02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280
we have this uh recalculate button which

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.069
we have this uh recalculate button which will uh perform manual recalculation of

02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079
will uh perform manual recalculation of

02:07:14.079 --> 02:07:17.669
will uh perform manual recalculation of the price list. So in case maybe uh like

02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679
the price list. So in case maybe uh like

02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:21.430
the price list. So in case maybe uh like message consumer got stucks uh uh or

02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440
message consumer got stucks uh uh or

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:24.069
message consumer got stucks uh uh or busy with too many messages uh in the

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079
busy with too many messages uh in the

02:07:24.079 --> 02:07:26.229
busy with too many messages uh in the queue you may use recalculate to

02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239
queue you may use recalculate to

02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:30.149
queue you may use recalculate to recalculate it uh faster uh avoiding uh

02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159
recalculate it uh faster uh avoiding uh

02:07:30.159 --> 02:07:33.109
recalculate it uh faster uh avoiding uh message queue. So we have the ability to

02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119
message queue. So we have the ability to

02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:36.709

02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040
And this is done using this uh product

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.990
And this is done using this uh product assignment and price calculation rules.

02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000
assignment and price calculation rules.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.750
assignment and price calculation rules. So product assignment is responsible for

02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760
So product assignment is responsible for

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.669
So product assignment is responsible for defining what products should be

02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679
defining what products should be

02:10:27.679 --> 02:10:29.990
defining what products should be assigned to this price list. For me not

02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000
assigned to this price list. For me not

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.830
assigned to this price list. For me not to add manually all products one by one

02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840
to add manually all products one by one

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:36.629
to add manually all products one by one uh or import them via file. But imagine

02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639
uh or import them via file. But imagine

02:10:36.639 --> 02:10:38.870
uh or import them via file. But imagine I will have I would like to have all

02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880
I will have I would like to have all

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:42.069
I will have I would like to have all products included in a in a uh in this

02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079
products included in a in a uh in this

02:10:42.079 --> 02:10:45.109
products included in a in a uh in this price list. So for that I have this uh

02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119
price list. So for that I have this uh

02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:47.750
price list. So for that I have this uh expression language and while clicking

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760
expression language and while clicking

02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:51.510
expression language and while clicking so it already suggests me few entities I

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520
so it already suggests me few entities I

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.149
so it already suggests me few entities I can work with for defining what kind of

02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159
can work with for defining what kind of

02:10:54.159 --> 02:10:56.870
can work with for defining what kind of products I would like to assign and we

02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880
products I would like to assign and we

02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.629
products I would like to assign and we have like either rely on the price list

02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639
have like either rely on the price list

02:11:00.639 --> 02:11:02.310
have like either rely on the price list entity

02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320
entity

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:06.149
entity uh or on some product. So let's pick up

02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159
uh or on some product. So let's pick up

02:11:06.159 --> 02:11:08.390
uh or on some product. So let's pick up uh I will create a test pick uh price

02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400
uh I will create a test pick uh price

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:13.030
uh I will create a test pick uh price list which will have uh as an example

02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040
list which will have uh as an example

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.109
list which will have uh as an example I will have a default price list plus uh

02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119
I will have a default price list plus uh

02:11:17.119 --> 02:11:20.390
I will have a default price list plus uh 10 percentage. So for that I will use as

02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400
10 percentage. So for that I will use as

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.550
10 percentage. So for that I will use as assigning products I will use price

02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560
assigning products I will use price

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.990
assigning products I will use price list. Uh then I will use uh uh default

02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000
list. Uh then I will use uh uh default

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.149
list. Uh then I will use uh uh default price list as a source of the products

02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159
price list as a source of the products

02:11:32.159 --> 02:11:37.669
price list as a source of the products and I will pick up uh pick up

02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679
and I will pick up uh pick up

02:11:37.679 --> 02:11:41.510
and I will pick up uh pick up created uh

02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520
created uh

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.430
created uh assign all assigned products.

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440
assign all assigned products.

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:48.629
assign all assigned products. Will it work? We'll we'll see.

02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639
Will it work? We'll we'll see.

02:11:48.639 --> 02:11:51.990
Will it work? We'll we'll see. And add a calculation. So here with the

02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000
And add a calculation. So here with the

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.189
And add a calculation. So here with the price calculation rules I will define.

02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199
price calculation rules I will define.

02:11:55.199 --> 02:11:59.030
price calculation rules I will define. So this part uh is responsible for u

02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040
So this part uh is responsible for u

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.669
So this part uh is responsible for u managing what kind of products I am

02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679
managing what kind of products I am

02:12:01.679 --> 02:12:04.550
managing what kind of products I am assigning to the price list while this

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560
assigning to the price list while this

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:08.390
assigning to the price list while this part is u responsible for defining how

02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400
part is u responsible for defining how

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.510
part is u responsible for defining how those prices should be

02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520
those prices should be

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.830
those prices should be uh should be assigned

02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840
uh should be assigned

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.669
uh should be assigned uh

02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679
uh

02:12:15.679 --> 02:12:19.270
uh should be calculated and um the

02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280
should be calculated and um the

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.709
should be calculated and um the calculation u of the prices are

02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719
calculation u of the prices are

02:12:22.719 --> 02:12:25.189
calculation u of the prices are performed based on the quantity

02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199
performed based on the quantity

02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:28.629
performed based on the quantity unit of uh measure or unit of quantity

02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639
unit of uh measure or unit of quantity

02:12:28.639 --> 02:12:32.790
unit of uh measure or unit of quantity and currency. So I will uh I may use

02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800
and currency. So I will uh I may use

02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:35.830
and currency. So I will uh I may use some static values uh like generate only

02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840
some static values uh like generate only

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.350
some static values uh like generate only for quantity one and for u specific uh

02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360
for quantity one and for u specific uh

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.430
for quantity one and for u specific uh set specific unit of measure and

02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440
set specific unit of measure and

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.189
set specific unit of measure and specific currency. On the other hand

02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199
specific currency. On the other hand

02:12:45.199 --> 02:12:47.990
specific currency. On the other hand side I can also use expression to

02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000
side I can also use expression to

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.109
side I can also use expression to generate this uh prices. I will pick up

02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119
generate this uh prices. I will pick up

02:12:51.119 --> 02:12:57.050
generate this uh prices. I will pick up expression and for the I will pick up.

02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:57.060
expression and for the I will pick up.

02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:58.390
expression and for the I will pick up. [Music]

02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400
[Music]

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:13.030
[Music] Let me check what was that.

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:25.750
Yeah, I should start price list.

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:28.550
So price list I will refer to I will

02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560
So price list I will refer to I will

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.589
So price list I will refer to I will pick up quantities or prices from price

02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599
pick up quantities or prices from price

02:13:31.599 --> 02:13:37.109
pick up quantities or prices from price list one within a uh within a for the

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119
list one within a uh within a for the

02:13:37.119 --> 02:13:39.910
list one within a uh within a for the price list one this is a default one

02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920
price list one this is a default one

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.310
price list one this is a default one there are prices which are defined there

02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320
there are prices which are defined there

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:44.069
there are prices which are defined there and quantity

02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079
and quantity

02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:46.069
and quantity yep quantity

02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079
yep quantity

02:13:46.079 --> 02:13:48.950
yep quantity for the unit I will also pick up price

02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960
for the unit I will also pick up price

02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:52.550
for the unit I will also pick up price list one uh prices units

02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560
list one uh prices units

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:56.709
list one uh prices units and for the currency

02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719
and for the currency

02:13:56.719 --> 02:13:59.990
and for the currency I will also pick up all prices from the

02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000
I will also pick up all prices from the

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.350
I will also pick up all prices from the price list one and their currencies and

02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360
price list one and their currencies and

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.550
price list one and their currencies and I will calculate uh product uh price as

02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560
I will calculate uh product uh price as

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:11.270
I will calculate uh product uh price as price list

02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280
price list

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.229
price list from the taking prices from the default

02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239
from the taking prices from the default

02:14:14.239 --> 02:14:18.870
from the taking prices from the default one I will pick up prices and the value

02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880
one I will pick up prices and the value

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.030
one I will pick up prices and the value which will be multiplied on

02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040
which will be multiplied on

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:24.629
which will be multiplied on 1.1

02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639
1.1

02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:27.030
1.1 which will be 10 percentage on top of

02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040
which will be 10 percentage on top of

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.510
which will be 10 percentage on top of the default price list. So once again we

02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520
the default price list. So once again we

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.189
the default price list. So once again we have

02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199
have

02:14:31.199 --> 02:14:34.950
have uh we have a price list which will be

02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960
uh we have a price list which will be

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.390
uh we have a price list which will be generated uh based on the default price

02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400
generated uh based on the default price

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.390
generated uh based on the default price list that's why I named it so uh so for

02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400
list that's why I named it so uh so for

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:45.189
list that's why I named it so uh so for assigning products I am using default

02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199
assigning products I am using default

02:14:45.199 --> 02:14:47.430
assigning products I am using default price list and picking up all assigned

02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440
price list and picking up all assigned

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:52.069
price list and picking up all assigned products and I'm using uh expression to

02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079
products and I'm using uh expression to

02:14:52.079 --> 02:14:55.270
products and I'm using uh expression to specify uh what quantity what unit of

02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280
specify uh what quantity what unit of

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.069
specify uh what quantity what unit of measure and what currency to pick up for

02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079
measure and what currency to pick up for

02:14:58.079 --> 02:15:01.750
measure and what currency to pick up for the qu for the prices and also the value

02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760
the qu for the prices and also the value

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:04.390
the qu for the prices and also the value how it should be calculated. I will save

02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400
how it should be calculated. I will save

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.510
how it should be calculated. I will save the changes. So and as a mandatory field

02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520
the changes. So and as a mandatory field

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:09.910
the changes. So and as a mandatory field I should have a priority defined uh for

02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920
I should have a priority defined uh for

02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:12.229
I should have a priority defined uh for this uh for this rules. And by the way,

02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239
this uh for this rules. And by the way,

02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:14.550
this uh for this rules. And by the way, you may have like uh a collection of

02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560
you may have like uh a collection of

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.069
you may have like uh a collection of rules uh here defined and all of them

02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079
rules uh here defined and all of them

02:15:18.079 --> 02:15:21.350
rules uh here defined and all of them will then be combined to the final one

02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360
will then be combined to the final one

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.669
will then be combined to the final one uh rule

02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679
uh rule

02:15:23.679 --> 02:15:25.750
uh rule and based on that not final actually

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760
and based on that not final actually

02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.030
and based on that not final actually rule but based on those set of rules uh

02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040
rule but based on those set of rules uh

02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.990
rule but based on those set of rules uh calculation rules final prices will be

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000
calculation rules final prices will be

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.709
calculation rules final prices will be uh will be prepared. Okay. I will have

02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:34.719
uh will be prepared. Okay. I will have

02:15:34.719 --> 02:15:37.910
uh will be prepared. Okay. I will have for now just one single rule. Uh I will

02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920
for now just one single rule. Uh I will

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.629
for now just one single rule. Uh I will save the changes.

02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639
save the changes.

02:15:40.639 --> 02:15:44.790
save the changes. Okay, this one I have used an incorrect

02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800
Okay, this one I have used an incorrect

02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:54.090
Okay, this one I have used an incorrect uh assigned products.

02:15:54.100 --> 02:16:03.430
[Music]

02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:05.430
So we see how we can build the

02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440
So we see how we can build the

02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.550
So we see how we can build the expression. So we have a suggestion

02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560
expression. So we have a suggestion

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.669
expression. So we have a suggestion um

02:16:11.679 --> 02:16:14.149
I would like to pick up all assigned

02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159
I would like to pick up all assigned

02:16:14.159 --> 02:16:16.629
I would like to pick up all assigned products in

02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639
products in

02:16:16.639 --> 02:16:18.709
products in ID.

02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719
ID.

02:16:18.719 --> 02:16:22.629
ID. Yeah, that will be let's pick up a bit

02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639
Yeah, that will be let's pick up a bit

02:16:22.639 --> 02:16:24.950
Yeah, that will be let's pick up a bit easier. I will pick up all products with

02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960
easier. I will pick up all products with

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.270
easier. I will pick up all products with ID

02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280
ID

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.270
ID uh product ID

02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280
uh product ID

02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:34.070
uh product ID more than zero. Just simply pick up all

02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080
more than zero. Just simply pick up all

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.349
more than zero. Just simply pick up all products. I will save the changes.

02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359
products. I will save the changes.

02:16:37.359 --> 02:16:39.589
products. I will save the changes. So it states that prices will be

02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599
So it states that prices will be

02:16:39.599 --> 02:16:42.790
So it states that prices will be recalculated.

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.790
Have I performed

02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800
Have I performed

02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:48.469
Have I performed uh recalculation take took place?

02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479
uh recalculation take took place?

02:16:48.479 --> 02:16:50.629
uh recalculation take took place? Now we have a default price list which

02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639
Now we have a default price list which

02:16:50.639 --> 02:16:53.030
Now we have a default price list which was generated

02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040
was generated

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.750
was generated uh using uh those expressions. We have

02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760
uh using uh those expressions. We have

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:58.950
uh using uh those expressions. We have specified uh prices were generated based

02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960
specified uh prices were generated based

02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.709
specified uh prices were generated based on the default price list and uh let's

02:17:02.709 --> 02:17:02.719
on the default price list and uh let's

02:17:02.719 --> 02:17:05.589
on the default price list and uh let's actually check it how it works. So I

02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599
actually check it how it works. So I

02:17:05.599 --> 02:17:07.990
actually check it how it works. So I will pick up uh so and it contains

02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000
will pick up uh so and it contains

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.150
will pick up uh so and it contains actually all the products from the from

02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160
actually all the products from the from

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.990
actually all the products from the from the default price list. U

02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000
the default price list. U

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.910
the default price list. U okay so I will pick up one of the

02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920
okay so I will pick up one of the

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:19.840
okay so I will pick up one of the products. Uh let's

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:19.850
products. Uh let's

02:17:19.850 --> 02:17:27.910
products. Uh let's [Music]

02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:29.910
go here.

02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920
go here.

02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:36.549
go here. I will pick up this one.

02:17:36.559 --> 02:17:41.349
product SKU. Okay, this one. Uh, so we

02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359
product SKU. Okay, this one. Uh, so we

02:17:41.359 --> 02:17:42.870
product SKU. Okay, this one. Uh, so we have

02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880
have

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:50.629
have I will sort by quantity.

02:17:50.639 --> 02:17:53.750
Okay, let's go to the default price

02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760
Okay, let's go to the default price

02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.870
Okay, let's go to the default price list.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.709
Pick up the same product.

02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719
Pick up the same product.

02:18:02.719 --> 02:18:06.469
Pick up the same product. uh for the same uh currency. Remember

02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479
uh for the same uh currency. Remember

02:18:06.479 --> 02:18:08.709
uh for the same uh currency. Remember the the one that we've just created we

02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719
the the one that we've just created we

02:18:08.719 --> 02:18:12.230
the the one that we've just created we were generated only for uh for US uh

02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240
were generated only for uh for US uh

02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:14.469
were generated only for uh for US uh dollars currency while default price

02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479
dollars currency while default price

02:18:14.479 --> 02:18:18.549
dollars currency while default price list it is it contains currency for uh

02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559
list it is it contains currency for uh

02:18:18.559 --> 02:18:20.950
list it is it contains currency for uh prices for multiple currencies. Okay, I

02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960
prices for multiple currencies. Okay, I

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.509
prices for multiple currencies. Okay, I will pick up US dollars only and uh okay

02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519
will pick up US dollars only and uh okay

02:18:25.519 --> 02:18:28.629
will pick up US dollars only and uh okay I will sort for now we have uh the same

02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639
I will sort for now we have uh the same

02:18:28.639 --> 02:18:31.030
I will sort for now we have uh the same product within a default price list.

02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040
product within a default price list.

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.270
product within a default price list. Prices are defined here. Just as an

02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280
Prices are defined here. Just as an

02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.750
Prices are defined here. Just as an example, for quantity one, we have

02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760
example, for quantity one, we have

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.910
example, for quantity one, we have almost 26 while on a default one. Uh for

02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920
almost 26 while on a default one. Uh for

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.230
almost 26 while on a default one. Uh for the quantity one, we have like all 28 uh

02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240
the quantity one, we have like all 28 uh

02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.870
the quantity one, we have like all 28 uh and almost half. So which is 10

02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880
and almost half. So which is 10

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:50.549
and almost half. So which is 10 percentage on top of uh of the one which

02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559
percentage on top of uh of the one which

02:18:50.559 --> 02:18:53.349
percentage on top of uh of the one which is specified here.

02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359
is specified here.

02:18:53.359 --> 02:18:55.750
is specified here. Yeah. And for actually for the quantity

02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760
Yeah. And for actually for the quantity

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.110
Yeah. And for actually for the quantity five we have 22 which is 10 percentage

02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120
five we have 22 which is 10 percentage

02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:03.669
five we have 22 which is 10 percentage more than uh 20 uh which is in a default

02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679
more than uh 20 uh which is in a default

02:19:03.679 --> 02:19:10.469
more than uh 20 uh which is in a default price list.

02:19:10.479 --> 02:19:12.709
Okay. So

02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719
Okay. So

02:19:12.719 --> 02:19:15.270
Okay. So with that we were able to generate price

02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280
with that we were able to generate price

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:21.750
with that we were able to generate price list uh based on some

02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.910
assignment what kind of products we

02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.920
assignment what kind of products we

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:26.709
assignment what kind of products we assign to the price list plus plus uh

02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719
assign to the price list plus plus uh

02:19:26.719 --> 02:19:30.150
assign to the price list plus plus uh what kind of uh how we are calculating

02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160
what kind of uh how we are calculating

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:32.870
what kind of uh how we are calculating the prices for the

02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880
the prices for the

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.349
the prices for the uh for this price list. So and here we

02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359
uh for this price list. So and here we

02:19:37.359 --> 02:19:40.150
uh for this price list. So and here we may notice that prices which are defined

02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160
may notice that prices which are defined

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:42.469
may notice that prices which are defined uh which are listed here they have they

02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479
uh which are listed here they have they

02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:45.990
uh which are listed here they have they are of type generated which means that

02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000
are of type generated which means that

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.910
are of type generated which means that uh yeah they were generated

02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920
uh yeah they were generated

02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.270
uh yeah they were generated automatically plus uh remember we were

02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280
automatically plus uh remember we were

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.870
automatically plus uh remember we were adding manually manually I have added

02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880
adding manually manually I have added

02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:58.070
adding manually manually I have added one of the prices. So we can contain uh

02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080
one of the prices. So we can contain uh

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.389
one of the prices. So we can contain uh we can have a price list with both

02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399
we can have a price list with both

02:20:00.399 --> 02:20:03.349
we can have a price list with both manually generated uh manually assigned

02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359
manually generated uh manually assigned

02:20:03.359 --> 02:20:07.910
manually generated uh manually assigned uh prices and also uh generated uh based

02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920
uh prices and also uh generated uh based

02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:12.389
uh prices and also uh generated uh based on some rules. Let me demonstrate how uh

02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399
on some rules. Let me demonstrate how uh

02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:16.630
on some rules. Let me demonstrate how uh this generation

02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.910
works. I will pick up the same product.

02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920
works. I will pick up the same product.

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:23.110
works. I will pick up the same product. And now I will

02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120
And now I will

02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:27.670
And now I will uh I will change and um addit price in

02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680
uh I will change and um addit price in

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:30.070
uh I will change and um addit price in the default price list which is the

02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080
the default price list which is the

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.389
the default price list which is the original one from which we created our

02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399
original one from which we created our

02:20:32.399 --> 02:20:35.750
original one from which we created our price list and change the price for this

02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760
price list and change the price for this

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:38.309
price list and change the price for this uh

02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319
uh

02:20:38.319 --> 02:20:45.270
uh uh for this

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:49.750
quantity. I will specify simply 26.

02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760
quantity. I will specify simply 26.

02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:53.990
quantity. I will specify simply 26. I will save.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.590
So now we have 26. Um

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:02.389
and if I refresh u the one that we've

02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399
and if I refresh u the one that we've

02:21:02.399 --> 02:21:04.950
and if I refresh u the one that we've just created prices with 10 percentage

02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960
just created prices with 10 percentage

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.150
just created prices with 10 percentage of and autogenerated price. So now I

02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160
of and autogenerated price. So now I

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:11.590
of and autogenerated price. So now I should have for the quantity one uh not

02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600
should have for the quantity one uh not

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.309
should have for the quantity one uh not this one value but another one which is

02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319
this one value but another one which is

02:21:16.319 --> 02:21:18.870
this one value but another one which is uh 28.6

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880
uh 28.6

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:22.309
uh 28.6 uh which was auto regenerated based on

02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319
uh which was auto regenerated based on

02:21:22.319 --> 02:21:26.230
uh which was auto regenerated based on the default uh price list. So changing

02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240
the default uh price list. So changing

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:31.270
the default uh price list. So changing doing updates in a dep um dependent u in

02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280
doing updates in a dep um dependent u in

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:33.910
doing updates in a dep um dependent u in the main in the base uh price list we

02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920
the main in the base uh price list we

02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:37.670
the main in the base uh price list we are also uh automatically uh introducing

02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680
are also uh automatically uh introducing

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:40.790
are also uh automatically uh introducing changes in the dependent u uh price

02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800
changes in the dependent u uh price

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:43.429
changes in the dependent u uh price list.

02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439
list.

02:21:43.439 --> 02:21:48.389
list. Let's switch back to

02:21:48.399 --> 02:21:53.750
uh to to the slides. Uh so those rules

02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760
uh to to the slides. Uh so those rules

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:56.150
uh to to the slides. Uh so those rules that I was demonstrated then they used

02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160
that I was demonstrated then they used

02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:58.790
that I was demonstrated then they used for automatic generation of price list

02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800
for automatic generation of price list

02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:02.630
for automatic generation of price list and uh we have seen that it might u rely

02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640
and uh we have seen that it might u rely

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:05.590
and uh we have seen that it might u rely on edit

02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600
on edit

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:09.429
on edit u so whenever I am picking up u some

02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439
u so whenever I am picking up u some

02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:12.469
u so whenever I am picking up u some entity it's also suggest me what kind of

02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479
entity it's also suggest me what kind of

02:22:12.479 --> 02:22:15.670
entity it's also suggest me what kind of property I of the entity I would like to

02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680
property I of the entity I would like to

02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:19.429
property I of the entity I would like to use what kind of sorry operators I would

02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439
use what kind of sorry operators I would

02:22:19.439 --> 02:22:22.070
use what kind of sorry operators I would like to use and so on and this is

02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080
like to use and so on and this is

02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:25.110
like to use and so on and this is applied for the rules and also for the

02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120
applied for the rules and also for the

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:28.070
applied for the rules and also for the uh for the calcula for the assignment

02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080
uh for the calcula for the assignment

02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:31.030
uh for the calcula for the assignment and also for the calculation rules. Uh

02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040
and also for the calculation rules. Uh

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:35.110
and also for the calculation rules. Uh we have uh what kind of um

02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120
we have uh what kind of um

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:37.190
we have uh what kind of um entities we can rely we can rely on a

02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200
entities we can rely we can rely on a

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.510
entities we can rely we can rely on a product entity or on a price list.

02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520
product entity or on a price list.

02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:42.630
product entity or on a price list. within a product entity, we can pick up

02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:42.640
within a product entity, we can pick up

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:47.270
within a product entity, we can pick up uh some specific u uh uh attribute or

02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280
uh some specific u uh uh attribute or

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:52.469
uh some specific u uh uh attribute or family and uh so in this way generate

02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479
family and uh so in this way generate

02:22:52.479 --> 02:22:56.230
family and uh so in this way generate prices only for specific uh

02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240
prices only for specific uh

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:59.110
prices only for specific uh um on specific uh attribute family or on

02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120
um on specific uh attribute family or on

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:05.429
um on specific uh attribute family or on specific uh uh category um user uh just

02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439
specific uh uh category um user uh just

02:23:05.439 --> 02:23:08.950
specific uh uh category um user uh just not on specific category. Let's actually

02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960
not on specific category. Let's actually

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.469
not on specific category. Let's actually quickly

02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479
quickly

02:23:10.479 --> 02:23:14.469
quickly uh I will put it here.

02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479
uh I will put it here.

02:23:14.479 --> 02:23:18.950
uh I will put it here. So if I specify product category

02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960
So if I specify product category

02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.990
So if I specify product category uh within a id let's say equal to

02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000
uh within a id let's say equal to

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.590
uh within a id let's say equal to sorry

02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600
sorry

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.309
sorry equal to 10 then I will generate prices

02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319
equal to 10 then I will generate prices

02:23:30.319 --> 02:23:33.270
equal to 10 then I will generate prices only for the product category with an ID

02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280
only for the product category with an ID

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:36.389
only for the product category with an ID 10 only those uh prices will be assigned

02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399
10 only those uh prices will be assigned

02:23:36.399 --> 02:23:38.469
10 only those uh prices will be assigned there.

02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479
there.

02:23:38.479 --> 02:23:43.670
there. And we have uh uh so documentation how

02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680
And we have uh uh so documentation how

02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.550
And we have uh uh so documentation how uh so this is built using symfony

02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560
uh so this is built using symfony

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:49.750
uh so this is built using symfony expressions uh this one expression

02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760
expressions uh this one expression

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.750
expressions uh this one expression language

02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760
language

02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:55.349
language which contains some out ofthe-box uh

02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359
which contains some out ofthe-box uh

02:23:55.359 --> 02:23:59.510
which contains some out ofthe-box uh literal and operators and so on. And on

02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520
literal and operators and so on. And on

02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:06.070
literal and operators and so on. And on top also introduces its own

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.990
capabilities for this for using those

02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000
capabilities for this for using those

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.590
capabilities for this for using those expressions.

02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600
expressions.

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:14.309
expressions. And we have this uh

02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319
And we have this uh

02:24:14.319 --> 02:24:18.150
And we have this uh uh this article where we have an

02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160
uh this article where we have an

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:21.910
uh this article where we have an examples of what kind of uh how those

02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920
examples of what kind of uh how those

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:24.630
examples of what kind of uh how those expressions could be used. Um here

02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640
expressions could be used. Um here

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:26.870
expressions could be used. Um here calculate as in conditions and then

02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880
calculate as in conditions and then

02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.750
calculate as in conditions and then calculate depending on a price list on a

02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760
calculate depending on a price list on a

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:33.270
calculate depending on a price list on a on a product how to pick up and with

02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280
on a product how to pick up and with

02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:36.630
on a product how to pick up and with with some cases uh how to generate them.

02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640
with some cases uh how to generate them.

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:39.110
with some cases uh how to generate them. Please refer to it once you will be

02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120
Please refer to it once you will be

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:49.510
Please refer to it once you will be setting up your your prices.

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.790
Um okay within a price assignment rule

02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800
Um okay within a price assignment rule

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.230
Um okay within a price assignment rule we defined uh products which should be

02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240
we defined uh products which should be

02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:01.190
we defined uh products which should be assigned to the price list. it is um it

02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200
assigned to the price list. it is um it

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:04.950
assigned to the price list. it is um it then assigns automatically based on that

02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960
then assigns automatically based on that

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:08.469
then assigns automatically based on that u criteria that matches the expression.

02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479
u criteria that matches the expression.

02:25:08.479 --> 02:25:13.349
u criteria that matches the expression. Um this one

02:25:13.359 --> 02:25:20.230
and um yeah just uh for as an easy

02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240
and um yeah just uh for as an easy

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:22.230
and um yeah just uh for as an easy example

02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240
example

02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.630
example just generating a price list for all the

02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640
just generating a price list for all the

02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:26.950
just generating a price list for all the products you may pick up product ID with

02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960
products you may pick up product ID with

02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:30.710
products you may pick up product ID with uh ID more than greater than zero and

02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720
uh ID more than greater than zero and

02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:33.990
uh ID more than greater than zero and you will have all products assigned

02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000
you will have all products assigned

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.389
you will have all products assigned and uh yeah I have demonstrated uh for

02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399
and uh yeah I have demonstrated uh for

02:25:38.399 --> 02:25:41.590
and uh yeah I have demonstrated uh for specific category. This is how we can um

02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600
specific category. This is how we can um

02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.309
specific category. This is how we can um assign products for specific category

02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319
assign products for specific category

02:25:46.319 --> 02:25:49.190
assign products for specific category and price calculation rules. So

02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200
and price calculation rules. So

02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:52.150
and price calculation rules. So calculation rules this is section this

02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160
calculation rules this is section this

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:58.710
calculation rules this is section this one. So it uh contains of specifying um

02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720
one. So it uh contains of specifying um

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:01.990
one. So it uh contains of specifying um the value for the quantity depending on

02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000
the value for the quantity depending on

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.030
the value for the quantity depending on the quantity unit and currency.

02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040
the quantity unit and currency.

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.510
the quantity unit and currency. uh and we can specify like static values

02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520
uh and we can specify like static values

02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.230
uh and we can specify like static values just not use uh depending on a uh price

02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240
just not use uh depending on a uh price

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:16.150
just not use uh depending on a uh price list or some other entity but just

02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160
list or some other entity but just

02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:18.630
list or some other entity but just depending on a uh not dependent but

02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640
depending on a uh not dependent but

02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:21.349
depending on a uh not dependent but simply for some static value just for

02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359
simply for some static value just for

02:26:21.359 --> 02:26:25.990
simply for some static value just for the US dollars or for some uh

02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000
the US dollars or for some uh

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.190
the US dollars or for some uh specific uh unit of quantity

02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200
specific uh unit of quantity

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:32.150
specific uh unit of quantity right so it depends how you would like

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160
right so it depends how you would like

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:34.950
right so it depends how you would like to generate whether

02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960
to generate whether

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:37.270
to generate whether depending on some expression or with

02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280
depending on some expression or with

02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.469
depending on some expression or with some static values. And we may have uh

02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479
some static values. And we may have uh

02:26:40.479 --> 02:26:48.630
some static values. And we may have uh this multiple uh

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.990
this multiple uh calculation rules. We

02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000
this multiple uh calculation rules. We

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.630
this multiple uh calculation rules. We can add it as a collection. Uh but then

02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640
can add it as a collection. Uh but then

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:57.510
can add it as a collection. Uh but then you would need to specify priority which

02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520
you would need to specify priority which

02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:59.510
you would need to specify priority which expression should be or which rule

02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520
expression should be or which rule

02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.190
expression should be or which rule should be taken first which should be

02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200
should be taken first which should be

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:04.870
should be taken first which should be taken the next one. Plus uh we may also

02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880
taken the next one. Plus uh we may also

02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:07.510
taken the next one. Plus uh we may also add an expression

02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520
add an expression

02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:12.070
add an expression for what uh uh condition to apply this

02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080
for what uh uh condition to apply this

02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.990
for what uh uh condition to apply this uh calculation. For instance, we would

02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000
uh calculation. For instance, we would

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.230
uh calculation. For instance, we would like to calculate this part uh

02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240
like to calculate this part uh

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:21.510
like to calculate this part uh only for products with the category

02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520
only for products with the category

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:25.429
only for products with the category uh ID equal to

02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439
uh ID equal to

02:27:25.439 --> 02:27:28.230
uh ID equal to uh equal to 10.

02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:28.240
uh equal to 10.

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:34.150
uh equal to 10. Here I will pick up all products

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.110
id.

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.990
So I am assigning all products but

02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000
So I am assigning all products but

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.389
So I am assigning all products but generating prices for category ID with

02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399
generating prices for category ID with

02:27:46.399 --> 02:27:48.230
generating prices for category ID with the

02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240
the

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:53.349
the multiplier one uh.1 while for the

02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359
multiplier one uh.1 while for the

02:27:53.359 --> 02:27:56.230
multiplier one uh.1 while for the for some other category let's say with

02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240
for some other category let's say with

02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:59.349
for some other category let's say with an ID 11 I would like to calculate

02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359
an ID 11 I would like to calculate

02:27:59.359 --> 02:28:04.070
an ID 11 I would like to calculate prices with a another value uh one

02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080
prices with a another value uh one

02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:08.070
prices with a another value uh one multiplier 1.2 like that. So this is the

02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080
multiplier 1.2 like that. So this is the

02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:13.990
multiplier 1.2 like that. So this is the where the conditions uh could be used

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.349
and uh whenever you are u introducing

02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359
and uh whenever you are u introducing

02:28:17.359 --> 02:28:19.990
and uh whenever you are u introducing this autogenerated uh prices with

02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:20.000
this autogenerated uh prices with

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.990
this autogenerated uh prices with multiple uh rules it takes some times

02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000
multiple uh rules it takes some times

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.270
multiple uh rules it takes some times though uh in the nearest

02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280
though uh in the nearest

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:30.710
though uh in the nearest um time it was uh improved and now it's

02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720
um time it was uh improved and now it's

02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:32.550
um time it was uh improved and now it's yeah it really takes some time but

02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560
yeah it really takes some time but

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:43.830
yeah it really takes some time but really uh very very little amount of

02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:48.790
Okay. And now let me uh

02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800
Okay. And now let me uh

02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:51.830
Okay. And now let me uh let me talk about uh price attributes.

02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840
let me talk about uh price attributes.

02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.590
let me talk about uh price attributes. Uh so remember we have prices um which

02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600
Uh so remember we have prices um which

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.270
Uh so remember we have prices um which are assigned to the uh to the price list

02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280
are assigned to the uh to the price list

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:01.750
are assigned to the uh to the price list and we are generated price list

02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760
and we are generated price list

02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:05.750
and we are generated price list depending on some u some values from the

02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760
depending on some u some values from the

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:09.190
depending on some u some values from the price list. So on the other hand side we

02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200
price list. So on the other hand side we

02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:12.150
price list. So on the other hand side we can generate prices uh depending on a

02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160
can generate prices uh depending on a

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:14.790
can generate prices uh depending on a price attributes. So what are price

02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800
price attributes. So what are price

02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:19.429
price attributes. So what are price attributes? So if you go to product uh

02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439
attributes? So if you go to product uh

02:29:19.439 --> 02:29:25.990
attributes? So if you go to product uh price

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.349
attribute.

02:29:33.359 --> 02:29:36.710
Okay. So we have already some uh uh

02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720
Okay. So we have already some uh uh

02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:41.030
Okay. So we have already some uh uh price attributes uh here listed. Uh so

02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040
price attributes uh here listed. Uh so

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:43.590
price attributes uh here listed. Uh so whenever we are adding additional

02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600
whenever we are adding additional

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.150
whenever we are adding additional attribute to add additional attribute

02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160
attribute to add additional attribute

02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:48.230
attribute to add additional attribute you would need to go just and create an

02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240
you would need to go just and create an

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.830
you would need to go just and create an attribute

02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840
attribute

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.910
attribute um specify uh the field name for this

02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920
um specify uh the field name for this

02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:57.270
um specify uh the field name for this attribute uh and currencies in which

02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280
attribute uh and currencies in which

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.990
attribute uh and currencies in which this attribute will be used. So right

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000
this attribute will be used. So right

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.349
this attribute will be used. So right here we we already have this ERP price

02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359
here we we already have this ERP price

02:30:03.359 --> 02:30:06.790
here we we already have this ERP price attribute. Imagine that this is the ERP

02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800
attribute. Imagine that this is the ERP

02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:10.469
attribute. Imagine that this is the ERP uh price the price which is in ERP

02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479
uh price the price which is in ERP

02:30:10.479 --> 02:30:13.270
uh price the price which is in ERP system which is uh provided on daily

02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280
system which is uh provided on daily

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:17.270
system which is uh provided on daily basis using some API u endpoints right

02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280
basis using some API u endpoints right

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:20.309
basis using some API u endpoints right we have this ERP price uh attributes

02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319
we have this ERP price uh attributes

02:30:20.319 --> 02:30:22.309
we have this ERP price uh attributes once we have it then it becomes

02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319
once we have it then it becomes

02:30:22.319 --> 02:30:26.389
once we have it then it becomes available on a product level so let me

02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399
available on a product level so let me

02:30:26.399 --> 02:30:28.150
available on a product level so let me go to

02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160
go to

02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:30.630
go to one of the products um and I will pick

02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640
one of the products um and I will pick

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:35.270
one of the products um and I will pick up actually this on

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:37.110
uh

02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120
uh

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:40.230
uh products

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:41.910
update.

02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920
update.

02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:44.950
update. Okay, so I have a product. If I go to

02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960
Okay, so I have a product. If I go to

02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:47.590
Okay, so I have a product. If I go to edit,

02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600
edit,

02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:51.270
edit, I have product prices remember depending

02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:51.280
I have product prices remember depending

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:54.630
I have product prices remember depending on a price list and I have a section uh

02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640
on a price list and I have a section uh

02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:58.309
on a price list and I have a section uh with the product prices to define uh uh

02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319
with the product prices to define uh uh

02:30:58.319 --> 02:31:01.190
with the product prices to define uh uh price attributes. These are um

02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200
price attributes. These are um

02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:03.830
price attributes. These are um attributes which goes out of the box

02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840
attributes which goes out of the box

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:06.150
attributes which goes out of the box with the demo data and I have created

02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160
with the demo data and I have created

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:09.510
with the demo data and I have created this ERP price uh which was specified

02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520
this ERP price uh which was specified

02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:13.030
this ERP price uh which was specified only for US dollars and now I am able to

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040
only for US dollars and now I am able to

02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:19.110
only for US dollars and now I am able to put the values here let's put uh 20 20

02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120
put the values here let's put uh 20 20

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:21.990
put the values here let's put uh 20 20 let it be simple

02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000
let it be simple

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.630
let it be simple uh oh I will not specify for the item

02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640
uh oh I will not specify for the item

02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:27.990
uh oh I will not specify for the item just for the set so price uh I have set

02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000
just for the set so price uh I have set

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.630
just for the set so price uh I have set to 20 I will save the changes.

02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640
to 20 I will save the changes.

02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:35.270
to 20 I will save the changes. So I have a

02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280
So I have a

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:40.950
So I have a price um

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:45.510
attribute ERP price with a value 20. Now

02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520
attribute ERP price with a value 20. Now

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:48.870
attribute ERP price with a value 20. Now I am able to generate a price list uh

02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880
I am able to generate a price list uh

02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:52.870
I am able to generate a price list uh based on the ERP price. Uh how to do

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880
based on the ERP price. Uh how to do

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:55.910
based on the ERP price. Uh how to do this? This actually this is the

02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920
this? This actually this is the

02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:58.070
this? This actually this is the the case where usually this price

02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080
the case where usually this price

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.790
the case where usually this price attributes are used. You have a year

02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800
attributes are used. You have a year

02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:05.510
attributes are used. You have a year price which is uh provided u regularly

02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520
price which is uh provided u regularly

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:08.070
price which is uh provided u regularly uh from year and based on it you are

02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080
uh from year and based on it you are

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:12.790
uh from year and based on it you are building a uh price list and adding some

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800
building a uh price list and adding some

02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:16.630
building a uh price list and adding some margin on top of it. I will go to price

02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640
margin on top of it. I will go to price

02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:22.230
margin on top of it. I will go to price list. Create a price list

02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.670
price list plus1 US.

02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680
price list plus1 US.

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:28.630
price list plus1 US. It will be for US dollars only. It will

02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640
It will be for US dollars only. It will

02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:30.710
It will be for US dollars only. It will be active.

02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720
be active.

02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:33.670
be active. I will assign

02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:33.680
I will assign

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:36.630
I will assign all products though only remember only

02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640
all products though only remember only

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:40.469
all products though only remember only one product has this ERP uh ERP price

02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479
one product has this ERP uh ERP price

02:32:40.479 --> 02:32:43.830
one product has this ERP uh ERP price and I will add price calculation rules.

02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840
and I will add price calculation rules.

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:49.990
and I will add price calculation rules. So for that I will pick up um

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.550
that pick up for quantity one

02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560
that pick up for quantity one

02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:55.510
that pick up for quantity one demonstrate not using expressions but

02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520
demonstrate not using expressions but

02:32:55.520 --> 02:33:02.790
demonstrate not using expressions but simply and for quant uh for unit uh set

02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800
simply and for quant uh for unit uh set

02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:05.670
simply and for quant uh for unit uh set uh for unit set

02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680
uh for unit set

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:07.830
uh for unit set for US dollar. So right now I am not

02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840
for US dollar. So right now I am not

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:10.550
for US dollar. So right now I am not using an expressions but just static

02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560
using an expressions but just static

02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:13.429
using an expressions but just static values and I will calculate the price

02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439
values and I will calculate the price

02:33:13.439 --> 02:33:18.230
values and I will calculate the price like product ERP price value

02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240
like product ERP price value

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:19.750
like product ERP price value plus

02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760
plus

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:24.230
plus uh one U plus one. Okay and priority

02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240
uh one U plus one. Okay and priority

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:27.429
uh one U plus one. Okay and priority one. So once again I am assigning all

02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439
one. So once again I am assigning all

02:33:27.439 --> 02:33:30.070
one. So once again I am assigning all products though only one product has ERP

02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080
products though only one product has ERP

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:32.469
products though only one product has ERP price and I am specifying how to

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479
price and I am specifying how to

02:33:32.479 --> 02:33:36.630
price and I am specifying how to calculate u price list uh price list uh

02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640
calculate u price list uh price list uh

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:39.750
calculate u price list uh price list uh depending on this price attribute. So I

02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760
depending on this price attribute. So I

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:42.150
depending on this price attribute. So I am specifying I would like pick up

02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160
am specifying I would like pick up

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:45.910
am specifying I would like pick up product Europe price value and multip

02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920
product Europe price value and multip

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:48.950
product Europe price value and multip sorry additionally one US dollar on top

02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960
sorry additionally one US dollar on top

02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:52.389
sorry additionally one US dollar on top of it and I'm not using any expressions

02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399
of it and I'm not using any expressions

02:33:52.399 --> 02:33:54.630
of it and I'm not using any expressions but just static values. I will save the

02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640
but just static values. I will save the

02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:01.429
but just static values. I will save the changes.

02:34:01.439 --> 02:34:04.230
Okay. So I have only one product where

02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:04.240
Okay. So I have only one product where

02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.950
Okay. So I have only one product where with the ERP price

02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960
with the ERP price

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:12.230
with the ERP price um it was um calculated based on ERP

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240
um it was um calculated based on ERP

02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:14.469
um it was um calculated based on ERP price 20

02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479
price 20

02:34:14.479 --> 02:34:17.030
price 20 and on top of that of that we add some

02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040
and on top of that of that we add some

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:19.110
and on top of that of that we add some additional margin which is equal to$1

02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120
additional margin which is equal to$1

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:20.870
additional margin which is equal to$1 US.

02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880
US.

02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:23.910
US. So that's how price attributes could be

02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920
So that's how price attributes could be

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.910
So that's how price attributes could be used. So if we will be introducing

02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920
used. So if we will be introducing

02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:29.910
used. So if we will be introducing another uh product uh

02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:29.920
another uh product uh

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:31.990
another uh product uh ERP

02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000
ERP

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.150
ERP um let's pick up um any actually but

02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160
um let's pick up um any actually but

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:40.389
um let's pick up um any actually but with the set you need to set let's

02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399
with the set you need to set let's

02:34:40.399 --> 02:34:46.309
with the set you need to set let's okay um

02:34:46.319 --> 02:34:49.590
this one should be with a set

02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600
this one should be with a set

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:53.670
this one should be with a set okay it works addit

02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680
okay it works addit

02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.429
okay it works addit So if I add ERP price attribute value

02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439
So if I add ERP price attribute value

02:34:57.439 --> 02:35:01.910
So if I add ERP price attribute value for another product uh let's pick uh

02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920
for another product uh let's pick uh

02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.750
for another product uh let's pick uh let's be 25

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.429
for the set. I will save the changes.

02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439
for the set. I will save the changes.

02:35:09.439 --> 02:35:11.750
for the set. I will save the changes. So remember I assigned all products to

02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760
So remember I assigned all products to

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.429
So remember I assigned all products to that u to this price list and now I

02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439
that u to this price list and now I

02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:17.750
that u to this price list and now I should have it there as well. So it was

02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760
should have it there as well. So it was

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:20.950
should have it there as well. So it was autogenerated and on top of 25

02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960
autogenerated and on top of 25

02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.590
autogenerated and on top of 25 additional one US dollar was added price

02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600
additional one US dollar was added price

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:29.270
additional one US dollar was added price we have here.

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.230
So just to conclude

02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240
So just to conclude

02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:35.830
So just to conclude uh we have this uh price attributes um

02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840
uh we have this uh price attributes um

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:38.950
uh we have this uh price attributes um you can create it um create them in the

02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960
you can create it um create them in the

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.950
you can create it um create them in the back office create as many as you would

02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960
back office create as many as you would

02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:43.349
back office create as many as you would like to have those price attributes.

02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359
like to have those price attributes.

02:35:43.359 --> 02:35:45.349
like to have those price attributes. Once you create them, they are then

02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359
Once you create them, they are then

02:35:45.359 --> 02:35:48.630
Once you create them, they are then available for managing uh for specifying

02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640
available for managing uh for specifying

02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.790
available for managing uh for specifying their values uh on a product edit page.

02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800
their values uh on a product edit page.

02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:55.110
their values uh on a product edit page. Uh the values are specified depending on

02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120
Uh the values are specified depending on

02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:00.150
Uh the values are specified depending on a uh unit of quantity and currency and

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160
a uh unit of quantity and currency and

02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.990
a uh unit of quantity and currency and then they could be used uh as uh

02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000
then they could be used uh as uh

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.550
then they could be used uh as uh building uh

02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560
building uh

02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:09.670
building uh defining price uh prices for the price

02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680
defining price uh prices for the price

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.590
defining price uh prices for the price list in uh using this uh rule

02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600
list in uh using this uh rule

02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.990
list in uh using this uh rule expressions

02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000
expressions

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.870
expressions and uh yeah so out of the box uh these

02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880
and uh yeah so out of the box uh these

02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:21.830
and uh yeah so out of the box uh these two manufacturer suggested retail price

02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840
two manufacturer suggested retail price

02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.990
two manufacturer suggested retail price if I'm not mistake taken it is called

02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000
if I'm not mistake taken it is called

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.349
if I'm not mistake taken it is called and some other manufacturer ad

02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359
and some other manufacturer ad

02:36:27.359 --> 02:36:30.389
and some other manufacturer ad advertisement price like that

02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399
advertisement price like that

02:36:30.399 --> 02:36:32.469
advertisement price like that and the values for those price

02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479
and the values for those price

02:36:32.479 --> 02:36:35.110
and the values for those price attributes they are kept in a price

02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120
attributes they are kept in a price

02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.750
attributes they are kept in a price attribute price list entity so you may

02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760
attribute price list entity so you may

02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:41.590
attribute price list entity so you may check how it looks like

02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:41.600
check how it looks like

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.750
check how it looks like and uh we have a couple of price

02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760
and uh we have a couple of price

02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:47.990
and uh we have a couple of price calculation examples let's open

02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000
calculation examples let's open

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.309
calculation examples let's open yeah depending on some um quantity on on

02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319
yeah depending on some um quantity on on

02:36:52.319 --> 02:36:57.190
yeah depending on some um quantity on on category on some value for those price

02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200
category on some value for those price

02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.670
category on some value for those price attributes.

02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680
attributes.

02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:02.070
attributes. Yeah. And the pro properties that's how

02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080
Yeah. And the pro properties that's how

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:06.230
Yeah. And the pro properties that's how it could be uh could be achieved. Yeah.

02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240
it could be uh could be achieved. Yeah.

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:07.830
it could be uh could be achieved. Yeah. By the way, you might have like

02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840
By the way, you might have like

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.270
By the way, you might have like additional value. You see that on a

02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280
additional value. You see that on a

02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:14.710
additional value. You see that on a category level have some uh margin uh

02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720
category level have some uh margin uh

02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:19.510
category level have some uh margin uh value and then define prices based on

02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520
value and then define prices based on

02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:23.670
value and then define prices based on MSRP value multiplying margin uh plus

02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680
MSRP value multiplying margin uh plus

02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.990
MSRP value multiplying margin uh plus five. So so the flexibility how you can

02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000
five. So so the flexibility how you can

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.309
five. So so the flexibility how you can use u uh this expression is quite wide

02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319
use u uh this expression is quite wide

02:37:32.319 --> 02:37:35.990
use u uh this expression is quite wide um for different cases

02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000
um for different cases

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.429
um for different cases and uh automation examples.

02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439
and uh automation examples.

02:37:39.439 --> 02:37:41.590
and uh automation examples. Yeah, this is something I was I guess I

02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600
Yeah, this is something I was I guess I

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.630
Yeah, this is something I was I guess I was already yeah some other examples how

02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640
was already yeah some other examples how

02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:46.950
was already yeah some other examples how this

02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960
this

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:50.309
this expressions could be used.

02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319
expressions could be used.

02:37:50.319 --> 02:37:55.510
expressions could be used. Okay, so let's uh before we go to

02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520
Okay, so let's uh before we go to

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:58.070
Okay, so let's uh before we go to continue with the pricing setup and go

02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080
continue with the pricing setup and go

02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:02.070
continue with the pricing setup and go to to more advanced things uh how they

02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080
to to more advanced things uh how they

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.630
to to more advanced things uh how they used then

02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640
used then

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:06.790
used then combined

02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800
combined

02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:08.790
combined and then presented in a storefront.

02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800
and then presented in a storefront.

02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:10.950
and then presented in a storefront. Let's uh

02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960
Let's uh

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:14.550
Let's uh make a break. But before a break uh

02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560
make a break. But before a break uh

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:16.550
make a break. But before a break uh let's check questions related to this

02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560
let's check questions related to this

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:24.150
let's check questions related to this part.

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.070
Okay. Is there any possibility to get

02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080
Okay. Is there any possibility to get

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.190
Okay. Is there any possibility to get access to the enterprise edition code uh

02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200
access to the enterprise edition code uh

02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:33.110
access to the enterprise edition code uh uh to so we can get better follow along

02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120
uh to so we can get better follow along

02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:34.870
uh to so we can get better follow along can gain understanding in our local

02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880
can gain understanding in our local

02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:38.870
can gain understanding in our local environments. So I guess uh like getting

02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880
environments. So I guess uh like getting

02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:41.110
environments. So I guess uh like getting this uh code

02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120
this uh code

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:43.910
this uh code uh locally this should be negotiated

02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920
uh locally this should be negotiated

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:46.870
uh locally this should be negotiated with the those who were organizing this

02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880
with the those who were organizing this

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:49.270
with the those who were organizing this training. I don't know maybe there are

02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280
training. I don't know maybe there are

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:51.270
training. I don't know maybe there are some

02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280
some

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.070
some uh agreements that could be uh done in

02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080
uh agreements that could be uh done in

02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:56.230
uh agreements that could be uh done in this in this area. On the other hand

02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240
this in this area. On the other hand

02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.190
this in this area. On the other hand side like we have a demo instance

02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200
side like we have a demo instance

02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:02.950
side like we have a demo instance and uh within a demo instance uh there

02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960
and uh within a demo instance uh there

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:05.990
and uh within a demo instance uh there is an ability to uh to check how

02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000
is an ability to uh to check how

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.190
is an ability to uh to check how enterprise edition works u from

02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200
enterprise edition works u from

02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.270
enterprise edition works u from management console from the back office

02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280
management console from the back office

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:18.309
management console from the back office standpoint. Uh

02:39:18.319 --> 02:39:22.550
so all those uh things are listed uh

02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560
so all those uh things are listed uh

02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.469
so all those uh things are listed uh uh here the same on the other hand side

02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479
uh here the same on the other hand side

02:39:26.479 --> 02:39:29.990
uh here the same on the other hand side check usage as a from the B2B store

02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000
check usage as a from the B2B store

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.110
check usage as a from the B2B store perspective as a buyer like logging in

02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120
perspective as a buyer like logging in

02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:36.870
perspective as a buyer like logging in with the administrative role user or as

02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880
with the administrative role user or as

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:40.230
with the administrative role user or as a buyer and exploring it here like these

02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240
a buyer and exploring it here like these

02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.950
a buyer and exploring it here like these are the options. Option number one is

02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960
are the options. Option number one is

02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:45.670
are the options. Option number one is negotiate uh with the organizers of this

02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680
negotiate uh with the organizers of this

02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:49.670
negotiate uh with the organizers of this training how you can get this enterprise

02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.680
training how you can get this enterprise

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:53.910
training how you can get this enterprise edition for uh local checkin or another

02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:53.920
edition for uh local checkin or another

02:39:53.920 --> 02:40:01.990
edition for uh local checkin or another option is to use demo autocommerce.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:12.309
Oops.

02:40:12.319 --> 02:40:16.389
Okay, this is the one.

02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399
Okay, this is the one.

02:40:16.399 --> 02:40:19.990
Okay, this is the one. Okay, the next question.

02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000
Okay, the next question.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.550
Okay, the next question. Does it have a builtin currency rate

02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560
Does it have a builtin currency rate

02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:25.510
Does it have a builtin currency rate sync with external services? Out of the

02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520
sync with external services? Out of the

02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:29.349
sync with external services? Out of the box, there is no uh built-in currency

02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359
box, there is no uh built-in currency

02:40:29.359 --> 02:40:32.150
box, there is no uh built-in currency rates uh synchronizations with external

02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160
rates uh synchronizations with external

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:34.790
rates uh synchronizations with external services. Yeah, you may because the

02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800
services. Yeah, you may because the

02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.750
services. Yeah, you may because the reason for that is those rates are

02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760
reason for that is those rates are

02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:40.630
reason for that is those rates are introduced there just to have some to

02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640
introduced there just to have some to

02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:43.270
introduced there just to have some to store the relation between base currency

02:40:43.270 --> 02:40:43.280
store the relation between base currency

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.309
store the relation between base currency and um and those additional currencies

02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319
and um and those additional currencies

02:40:48.319 --> 02:40:52.309
and um and those additional currencies they are those rates exist in a system

02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319
they are those rates exist in a system

02:40:52.319 --> 02:40:54.950
they are those rates exist in a system in a database in a back office and it's

02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960
in a database in a back office and it's

02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.230
in a database in a back office and it's up to you to decide how to use it uh in

02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240
up to you to decide how to use it uh in

02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:00.630
up to you to decide how to use it uh in orcommerce storefront or back office

02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:00.640
orcommerce storefront or back office

02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:03.190
orcommerce storefront or back office they are not used just store it that you

02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200
they are not used just store it that you

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.790
they are not used just store it that you may uh use it u for your needs within

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800
may uh use it u for your needs within

02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.469
may uh use it u for your needs within your customization.

02:41:10.479 --> 02:41:13.349
The next question uh how to make custom

02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359
The next question uh how to make custom

02:41:13.359 --> 02:41:16.630
The next question uh how to make custom product attribute support translations

02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640
product attribute support translations

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:18.870
product attribute support translations custom product attribute support

02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880
custom product attribute support

02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:22.389
custom product attribute support translation. Okay. So this is uh the

02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399
translation. Okay. So this is uh the

02:41:22.399 --> 02:41:28.870
translation. Okay. So this is uh the topic uh related to product attributes

02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880
topic uh related to product attributes

02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:36.870
topic uh related to product attributes support translation.

02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:41.110
Let me close this thing.

02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.230
Product attributes.

02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240
Product attributes.

02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:46.950
Product attributes. So if you are creating

02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960
So if you are creating

02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.190
So if you are creating you are not

02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200
you are not

02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:53.030
you are not you have it the field type

02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040
you have it the field type

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.670
you have it the field type and that's it. Okay. And what do we

02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680
and that's it. Okay. And what do we

02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:59.510
and that's it. Okay. And what do we have? Okay. Whenever we have created

02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520
have? Okay. Whenever we have created

02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:04.070
have? Okay. Whenever we have created label

02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:12.950
Mhm.

02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:15.670
So you would need to So the idea is to

02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680
So you would need to So the idea is to

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:17.429
So you would need to So the idea is to my understanding you have an attribute

02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439
my understanding you have an attribute

02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:19.510
my understanding you have an attribute you are displaying that attribute on a

02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520
you are displaying that attribute on a

02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:21.990
you are displaying that attribute on a product details page and you would like

02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000
product details page and you would like

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.349
product details page and you would like to have it displayed not uh like this uh

02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359
to have it displayed not uh like this uh

02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:31.110
to have it displayed not uh like this uh brand uh but already translated. Uh so

02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120
brand uh but already translated. Uh so

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.429
brand uh but already translated. Uh so we I have checked uh there is no

02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439
we I have checked uh there is no

02:42:33.439 --> 02:42:36.309
we I have checked uh there is no possibility for that. What how I would

02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319
possibility for that. What how I would

02:42:36.319 --> 02:42:39.429
possibility for that. What how I would achieve that? I would uh introduce a

02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439
achieve that? I would uh introduce a

02:42:39.439 --> 02:42:44.150
achieve that? I would uh introduce a translation key which will be built uh

02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160
translation key which will be built uh

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:45.990
translation key which will be built uh based on

02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000
based on

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.230
based on uh based on attribute uh code

02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240
uh based on attribute uh code

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.230
uh based on attribute uh code um and have this translation

02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240
um and have this translation

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:57.349
um and have this translation uh defined here.

02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359
uh defined here.

02:42:57.359 --> 02:42:59.110
uh defined here. So system

02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120
So system

02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:01.110
So system one second

02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120
one second

02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:04.469
one second I will switch to global organization.

02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479
I will switch to global organization.

02:43:04.479 --> 02:43:07.510
I will switch to global organization. Uh so here we have uh translations uh

02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520
Uh so here we have uh translations uh

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.710
Uh so here we have uh translations uh localization translations

02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720
localization translations

02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.630
localization translations and so then you will you could manage

02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640
and so then you will you could manage

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:14.389
and so then you will you could manage actually those translations. So imagine

02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399
actually those translations. So imagine

02:43:14.399 --> 02:43:18.309
actually those translations. So imagine you will have a

02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319
you will have a

02:43:18.319 --> 02:43:22.150
you will have a uh a key translation key like let's say

02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160
uh a key translation key like let's say

02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:27.349
uh a key translation key like let's say oro product then uh product uh uh

02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359
oro product then uh product uh uh

02:43:27.359 --> 02:43:31.190
oro product then uh product uh uh attribute code let's say brand or color

02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200
attribute code let's say brand or color

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:33.750
attribute code let's say brand or color and then label and for that you will

02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760
and then label and for that you will

02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:35.830
and then label and for that you will have a translation

02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840
have a translation

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:38.550
have a translation uh then you would need you could then

02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560
uh then you would need you could then

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.309
uh then you would need you could then specify this translation for different

02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319
specify this translation for different

02:43:40.319 --> 02:43:43.830
specify this translation for different languages like English uh

02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:43.840
languages like English uh

02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:48.950
languages like English uh uh Chinese whatever and then use it uh

02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960
uh Chinese whatever and then use it uh

02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:52.630
uh Chinese whatever and then use it uh uh in your template just uh instead of

02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640
uh in your template just uh instead of

02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:55.590
uh in your template just uh instead of customize the template and instead of

02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600
customize the template and instead of

02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:58.950
customize the template and instead of providing uh

02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960
providing uh

02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:06.870
providing uh brand uh just list u

02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:10.070
but wait uh it should be already it

02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080
but wait uh it should be already it

02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:13.590
but wait uh it should be already it should be already added as uh as

02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600
should be already added as uh as

02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.030
should be already added as uh as translatable values. Uh

02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040
translatable values. Uh

02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:20.309
translatable values. Uh yep, it should be uh so these values

02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319
yep, it should be uh so these values

02:44:20.319 --> 02:44:23.429
yep, it should be uh so these values this these labels should already be um

02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439
this these labels should already be um

02:44:23.439 --> 02:44:26.710
this these labels should already be um added as translatable keys and uh so

02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720
added as translatable keys and uh so

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:28.630
added as translatable keys and uh so defining translation for other for the

02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640
defining translation for other for the

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.870
defining translation for other for the same key for but for other language you

02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880
same key for but for other language you

02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:33.750
same key for but for other language you should have it uh already translated.

02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760
should have it uh already translated.

02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:43.910
should have it uh already translated. Yeah, I recollected. So if you go to

02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:47.670
so whenever you are introducing a new

02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680
so whenever you are introducing a new

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:51.750
so whenever you are introducing a new um a new entity field or attribute uh

02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:51.760
um a new entity field or attribute uh

02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:53.269
um a new entity field or attribute uh then you would need to specify a

02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279
then you would need to specify a

02:44:53.279 --> 02:44:55.910
then you would need to specify a translation for that um uh for that

02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920
translation for that um uh for that

02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:01.349
translation for that um uh for that attribute in a messages YAML uh file.

02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359
attribute in a messages YAML uh file.

02:45:01.359 --> 02:45:05.429
attribute in a messages YAML uh file. Yes. Uh no I mean um we have name we

02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:05.439
Yes. Uh no I mean um we have name we

02:45:05.439 --> 02:45:07.429
Yes. Uh no I mean um we have name we have name translated into different

02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439
have name translated into different

02:45:07.439 --> 02:45:11.510
have name translated into different languages. I'd like to have second name

02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520
languages. I'd like to have second name

02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:14.389
languages. I'd like to have second name for example for product

02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399
for example for product

02:45:14.399 --> 02:45:19.510
for example for product uh features attribute uh so I can put

02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520
uh features attribute uh so I can put

02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:22.550
uh features attribute uh so I can put the translation.

02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560
the translation.

02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:27.349
the translation. So uh just uh to clarify so you would

02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359
So uh just uh to clarify so you would

02:45:27.359 --> 02:45:30.150
So uh just uh to clarify so you would like to have this not is featured right?

02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:30.160
like to have this not is featured right?

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:32.550
like to have this not is featured right? But let's actually quickly check. Uh

02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560
But let's actually quickly check. Uh

02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:35.910
But let's actually quickly check. Uh no no uh example example we have

02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920
no no uh example example we have

02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:38.389
no no uh example example we have description translated into different

02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399
description translated into different

02:45:38.399 --> 02:45:39.269
description translated into different languages.

02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279
languages.

02:45:39.279 --> 02:45:39.590
languages. Okay.

02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600
Okay.

02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:43.110
Okay. I'd like to have second description

02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120
I'd like to have second description

02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:48.710
I'd like to have second description translated into different languages.

02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:52.070
Mhm. Let's go quickly and check to

02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080
Mhm. Let's go quickly and check to

02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:55.349
Mhm. Let's go quickly and check to product uh product.

02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359
product uh product.

02:45:55.359 --> 02:45:59.830
product uh product. Uh let's pick up uh this product

02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840
Uh let's pick up uh this product

02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.910
Uh let's pick up uh this product addit.

02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920
addit.

02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:04.070
addit. So okay, we have this short description.

02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080
So okay, we have this short description.

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:07.349
So okay, we have this short description. It is localizable and

02:46:07.349 --> 02:46:07.359
It is localizable and

02:46:07.359 --> 02:46:09.510
It is localizable and it could be translated. Uh you can

02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520
it could be translated. Uh you can

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:11.910
it could be translated. Uh you can specify translation for this another

02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920
specify translation for this another

02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:13.910
specify translation for this another value for another language. And we have

02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920
value for another language. And we have

02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:16.550
value for another language. And we have this uh long description or just

02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560
this uh long description or just

02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:19.990
this uh long description or just description uh which is also localizable

02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000
description uh which is also localizable

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.070
description uh which is also localizable value and you can not inherit but use a

02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080
value and you can not inherit but use a

02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:28.070
value and you can not inherit but use a custom uh translation. Will it work or

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080
custom uh translation. Will it work or

02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:29.269
custom uh translation. Will it work or you are checking?

02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279
you are checking?

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:31.830
you are checking? Yeah. But when I try to create a new

02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840
Yeah. But when I try to create a new

02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:34.469
Yeah. But when I try to create a new attribute

02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479
attribute

02:46:34.479 --> 02:46:36.710
attribute there is no translations like this.

02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720
there is no translations like this.

02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:38.790
there is no translations like this. I see. So with that you would need to

02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800
I see. So with that you would need to

02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:41.429
I see. So with that you would need to create a localizable

02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439
create a localizable

02:46:41.439 --> 02:46:46.150
create a localizable uh localizable u value uh localizable

02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160
uh localizable u value uh localizable

02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.309
uh localizable u value uh localizable field

02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319
field

02:46:48.319 --> 02:46:56.070
field uh

02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:57.590
let's

02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600
let's

02:46:57.600 --> 02:46:59.429
let's check quickly

02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439
check quickly

02:46:59.439 --> 02:47:02.790
check quickly product uh attributes

02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800
product uh attributes

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:08.070
product uh attributes uh not price but uh product

02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:10.309
product attributes. Okay. Create

02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319
product attributes. Okay. Create

02:47:10.319 --> 02:47:12.070
product attributes. Okay. Create attribute.

02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080
attribute.

02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:17.429
attribute. I will pick up

02:47:17.439 --> 02:47:20.710
other description

02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720

other description with the underscore.

02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:23.120
with the underscore.

02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:26.230
with the underscore. Okay. And here we would need to add uh

02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240
Okay. And here we would need to add uh

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.110
Okay. And here we would need to add uh many to many many probably many to many

02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120
many to many many probably many to many

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:33.510
many to many many probably many to many many to one. Okay. Let's pick up many to

02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:33.520
many to one. Okay. Let's pick up many to

02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.830

many relation

02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:37.590
many relation and

02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:37.600
and

02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:39.349
and localizable

02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359
localizable

02:47:39.359 --> 02:47:43.910
localizable like this one localization uh I

02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920
like this one localization uh I

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:47.830
like this one localization uh I local uh localizable pullback value.

02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840
local uh localizable pullback value.

02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:53.110
local uh localizable pullback value. Okay. Birectional no let it be string

02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120
Okay. Birectional no let it be string

02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:55.990
Okay. Birectional no let it be string string and string

02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000
string and string

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.950
string and string and I will save.

02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960
and I will save.

02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:01.590
and I will save. I will update schema.

02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600
I will update schema.

02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:03.750
I will update schema. it will take same time. So with that you

02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760
it will take same time. So with that you

02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.230
it will take same time. So with that you will have an attribute with a relation

02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240
will have an attribute with a relation

02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.230
will have an attribute with a relation to localizable value.

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:12.550
Thank you.

02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560
Thank you.

02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.790
Thank you. So let's wait but I'm pretty sure this

02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800
So let's wait but I'm pretty sure this

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.950
So let's wait but I'm pretty sure this is the how it could be achieved.

02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960
is the how it could be achieved.

02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:23.269
is the how it could be achieved. Uh okay the next question uh which

02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279
Uh okay the next question uh which

02:48:23.279 --> 02:48:25.510
Uh okay the next question uh which attributes are available for price

02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520
attributes are available for price

02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.790
attributes are available for price rules. So for price rules I available uh

02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800
rules. So for price rules I available uh

02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:33.510
rules. So for price rules I available uh price attributes but also I suppose uh

02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520
price attributes but also I suppose uh

02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:36.230
price attributes but also I suppose uh so we can

02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240
so we can

02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:39.750
so we can okay schema updated uh product

02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760
okay schema updated uh product

02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:41.910
okay schema updated uh product uh let's check previous

02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920
uh let's check previous

02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:44.950
uh let's check previous case we were talking edit

02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960
case we were talking edit

02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:48.950
case we were talking edit um

02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:52.469
description

02:48:52.479 --> 02:49:01.990
uh what we were introducing

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.830
uh we have not added it to product

02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840
uh we have not added it to product

02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:05.349
uh we have not added it to product family. So remember after you have

02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359
family. So remember after you have

02:49:05.359 --> 02:49:08.070
family. So remember after you have created a product uh attribute you would

02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080
created a product uh attribute you would

02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.070
created a product uh attribute you would need to add it to the product family. So

02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080
need to add it to the product family. So

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:11.910
need to add it to the product family. So once you will create add to product

02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920
once you will create add to product

02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:15.110
once you will create add to product family it will be here and so it should

02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120
family it will be here and so it should

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:19.110
family it will be here and so it should be okay let's quickly do it.

02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120
be okay let's quickly do it.

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:21.429
be okay let's quickly do it. Uh default

02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120
uh I will put to general

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.910
uh I will put to general uh what was that other description save

02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920
uh what was that other description save

02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:37.030

02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:57.990
Do we have it in a short description?

02:49:57.990 --> 02:49:58.000
Do we have it in a short description?

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:01.190
Do we have it in a short description? Other description here. Add

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200
Other description here. Add

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.630
Other description here. Add uh yeah, this is some localized fallback

02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640
uh yeah, this is some localized fallback

02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:07.510
uh yeah, this is some localized fallback value. This is not it.

02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:07.520
value. This is not it.

02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.349
value. This is not it. Um these are the values which already

02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359
Um these are the values which already

02:50:09.359 --> 02:50:11.830
Um these are the values which already exist in a database.

02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840
exist in a database.

02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:15.429
exist in a database. Um so I would need to check uh what kind

02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439
Um so I would need to check uh what kind

02:50:15.439 --> 02:50:18.389
Um so I would need to check uh what kind of relation uh need to be set up for

02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399
of relation uh need to be set up for

02:50:18.399 --> 02:50:21.510
of relation uh need to be set up for localizable uh uh for localizable

02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520
localizable uh uh for localizable

02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:25.990
localizable uh uh for localizable fields. I will check

02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.000
fields. I will check

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.550
fields. I will check uh but yeah for that you would need to

02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560
uh but yeah for that you would need to

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:31.910
uh but yeah for that you would need to use this uh some kind of relation. Yeah,

02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920
use this uh some kind of relation. Yeah,

02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:35.269
use this uh some kind of relation. Yeah, the same like uh it is done for name.

02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279
the same like uh it is done for name.

02:50:35.279 --> 02:50:37.030
the same like uh it is done for name. For example,

02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040
For example,

02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:40.230
For example, there is a button you can click

02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240
there is a button you can click

02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.830
there is a button you can click from what?

02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840
from what?

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.230
from what? Name attribute. You can click on name.

02:50:46.230 --> 02:50:46.240
Name attribute. You can click on name.

02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:49.190
Name attribute. You can click on name. Yeah, but remember this name attribute.

02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200
Yeah, but remember this name attribute.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.910
Yeah, but remember this name attribute. This is a a separate entity uh that is

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920
This is a a separate entity uh that is

02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:55.510
This is a a separate entity uh that is used for the product name which is

02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520
used for the product name which is

02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:58.070
used for the product name which is called product name which is also like

02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080
called product name which is also like

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:01.429
called product name which is also like reusing localizable fallback value. Uh

02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439
reusing localizable fallback value. Uh

02:51:01.439 --> 02:51:05.269
reusing localizable fallback value. Uh but uh yeah this is a separate u value

02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279
but uh yeah this is a separate u value

02:51:05.279 --> 02:51:07.670
but uh yeah this is a separate u value the separate entity used. So you would

02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680
the separate entity used. So you would

02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:09.269
the separate entity used. So you would need

02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279
need

02:51:09.279 --> 02:51:12.230
need uh yeah probably you could reuse this

02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.240
uh yeah probably you could reuse this

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:15.269
uh yeah probably you could reuse this entity for

02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:15.279
entity for

02:51:15.279 --> 02:51:17.590
entity for uh for other product attributes like

02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600
uh for other product attributes like

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:22.389
uh for other product attributes like reuse product uh uh

02:51:22.389 --> 02:51:22.399
reuse product uh uh

02:51:22.399 --> 02:51:25.990
reuse product uh uh product name uh localizable value just

02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:26.000
product name uh localizable value just

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:43.429
product name uh localizable value just use as a relation to your new attribute.

02:51:43.439 --> 02:51:45.990
So here we have specified as target

02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000
So here we have specified as target

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.870
So here we have specified as target entity localized fallback but in our

02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880
entity localized fallback but in our

02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:51.429
entity localized fallback but in our case I guess we should have and actually

02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439
case I guess we should have and actually

02:51:51.439 --> 02:51:54.309
case I guess we should have and actually we can check in examples here for short

02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319
we can check in examples here for short

02:51:54.319 --> 02:51:56.070
we can check in examples here for short description but these are also using

02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080
description but these are also using

02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:01.190
description but these are also using like a separate uh entities Uh uh

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200
like a separate uh entities Uh uh

02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:05.510
like a separate uh entities Uh uh uh I'm not able to to edit

02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520
uh I'm not able to to edit

02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.670
uh I'm not able to to edit a name.

02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680
a name.

02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:10.950
a name. Yeah, also not able to to to edit these

02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960
Yeah, also not able to to to edit these

02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:18.309
Yeah, also not able to to to edit these fields

02:52:18.319 --> 02:52:22.710
product attributes.

02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:26.070
Okay. So here we can find

02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080
Okay. So here we can find

02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:28.550
Okay. So here we can find uh this is a system relation. Yeah, it

02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560
uh this is a system relation. Yeah, it

02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:31.990
uh this is a system relation. Yeah, it doesn't demonstrate you to what I would

02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000
doesn't demonstrate you to what I would

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:35.510
doesn't demonstrate you to what I would need to check uh separately what kind of

02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520
need to check uh separately what kind of

02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:37.750
need to check uh separately what kind of relation you would need to to introduce

02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760
relation you would need to to introduce

02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:44.389
relation you would need to to introduce for this localizable uh uh values. Okay.

02:52:44.399 --> 02:52:47.269
System relation.

02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279
System relation.

02:52:47.279 --> 02:52:49.910
System relation. Yeah, we can view it tomorrow maybe.

02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920
Yeah, we can view it tomorrow maybe.

02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:52.630
Yeah, we can view it tomorrow maybe. Mhm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I will check it

02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.640
Mhm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I will check it

02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:57.510
Mhm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I will check it uh later. So uh the next question was uh

02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520
uh later. So uh the next question was uh

02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.429
uh later. So uh the next question was uh how to make custom product attributes

02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439
how to make custom product attributes

02:52:59.439 --> 02:53:01.190
how to make custom product attributes support translation we did it which

02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200
support translation we did it which

02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.349
support translation we did it which attributes available for price rule. So

02:53:03.349 --> 02:53:03.359
attributes available for price rule. So

02:53:03.359 --> 02:53:06.950
attributes available for price rule. So all uh price uh attributes are available

02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960
all uh price uh attributes are available

02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:10.790
all uh price uh attributes are available but we may also check uh here

02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800
but we may also check uh here

02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:21.349
but we may also check uh here um where we were on second.

02:53:21.359 --> 02:53:24.630
Okay. Price list

02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640
Okay. Price list

02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:27.110
Okay. Price list chicks.

02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120
chicks.

02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:28.870
chicks. Mhm.

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880
Mhm.

02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:32.630
Mhm. Or rules, right?

02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640
Or rules, right?

02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:36.230
Or rules, right? Especially for price uh for price rules.

02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240
Especially for price uh for price rules.

02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:39.190
Especially for price uh for price rules. Okay. If I go to product

02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200
Okay. If I go to product

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.910
Okay. If I go to product uh so yeah

02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920
uh so yeah

02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:43.990
uh so yeah only attri uh price attributes are

02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000
only attri uh price attributes are

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.830
only attri uh price attributes are available here and also category which

02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840
available here and also category which

02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:47.349
available here and also category which is not an attribute but rather a

02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359
is not an attribute but rather a

02:53:47.359 --> 02:53:49.990
is not an attribute but rather a relation which is exposed. If these

02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000
relation which is exposed. If these

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:53.269
relation which is exposed. If these things are not enough uh in your case uh

02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279
things are not enough uh in your case uh

02:53:53.279 --> 02:53:56.550
things are not enough uh in your case uh then it will be a customization to uh

02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560
then it will be a customization to uh

02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:59.830
then it will be a customization to uh introduce other uh relations which will

02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840
introduce other uh relations which will

02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:01.750
introduce other uh relations which will be available for calculation. But right

02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760
be available for calculation. But right

02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:07.510
be available for calculation. But right now relation to category plus uh this uh

02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520
now relation to category plus uh this uh

02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:12.070
now relation to category plus uh this uh price attributes.

02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:14.150
Okay. The next can the price rules be

02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160
Okay. The next can the price rules be

02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:18.309
Okay. The next can the price rules be applied over another rules? Uh so if you

02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319
applied over another rules? Uh so if you

02:54:18.319 --> 02:54:21.349
applied over another rules? Uh so if you have already a price list uh like this

02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359
have already a price list uh like this

02:54:21.359 --> 02:54:25.670
have already a price list uh like this one uh generated

02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680
one uh generated

02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:28.469
one uh generated this one we have a price list generated

02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479
this one we have a price list generated

02:54:28.479 --> 02:54:33.349
this one we have a price list generated on top of uh default it is generated

02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359
on top of uh default it is generated

02:54:33.359 --> 02:54:35.830
on top of uh default it is generated based on some rules. You can easily

02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840
based on some rules. You can easily

02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:38.389
based on some rules. You can easily introduce another price list which will

02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399
introduce another price list which will

02:54:38.399 --> 02:54:41.349
introduce another price list which will be generated on top of this one. it will

02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:41.359
be generated on top of this one. it will

02:54:41.359 --> 02:54:46.950
be generated on top of this one. it will be simply picking up uh uh picking up um

02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960
be simply picking up uh uh picking up um

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.630
be simply picking up uh uh picking up um prices and recalculated based on

02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640
prices and recalculated based on

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:52.950
prices and recalculated based on generated here.

02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960
generated here.

02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.230
generated here. So yes, you can just continue like using

02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:56.240
So yes, you can just continue like using

02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:00.469
So yes, you can just continue like using this example. We can build another one

02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479
this example. We can build another one

02:55:00.479 --> 02:55:04.070
this example. We can build another one uh which will be on top of default plus

02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080
uh which will be on top of default plus

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:07.429
uh which will be on top of default plus 10 percentage.

02:55:07.439 --> 02:55:10.870
Okay, that's it um for now with the

02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:10.880
Okay, that's it um for now with the

02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:14.469
Okay, that's it um for now with the questions. So let's make a 10 minutes uh

02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479
questions. So let's make a 10 minutes uh

02:55:14.479 --> 02:55:19.590
questions. So let's make a 10 minutes uh 20 sorry 20 minutes break and we will

02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600
20 sorry 20 minutes break and we will

02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:22.870
20 sorry 20 minutes break and we will continue with the uh price calculations

02:55:22.870 --> 02:55:22.880
continue with the uh price calculations

02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:26.710
continue with the uh price calculations uh especially using prices

02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720
uh especially using prices

02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:28.870
uh especially using prices uh how set up them how they are set up

02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880
uh how set up them how they are set up

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:32.389
uh how set up them how they are set up on different levels uh how fallbacks for

02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399
on different levels uh how fallbacks for

02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:35.030
on different levels uh how fallbacks for the prices used what kind of strategies

02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040
the prices used what kind of strategies

02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.950
the prices used what kind of strategies uh we have to define the final price

02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960
uh we have to define the final price

02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.670
uh we have to define the final price yeah we'll continue after uh 20 minutes.

02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680
yeah we'll continue after uh 20 minutes.

02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:47.750
yeah we'll continue after uh 20 minutes. See you in 20 minutes.

02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760
See you in 20 minutes.

02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.590
See you in 20 minutes. Okay,

02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:53.590
I am here.

02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600
I am here.

02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:56.550
I am here. Thank you.

02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560
Thank you.

02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.309
Thank you. Thanks. So, let's continue then. So we

02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319
Thanks. So, let's continue then. So we

02:56:00.319 --> 02:56:02.630
Thanks. So, let's continue then. So we have checked uh just to recap we have

02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640
have checked uh just to recap we have

02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:05.590
have checked uh just to recap we have checked how prices could be created and

02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600
checked how prices could be created and

02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.389
checked how prices could be created and they are actually created based on the

02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399
they are actually created based on the

02:56:08.399 --> 02:56:11.910
they are actually created based on the uh on some according to some price list.

02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:11.920
uh on some according to some price list.

02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:14.389
uh on some according to some price list. Uh having a price list does not mean

02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399
Uh having a price list does not mean

02:56:14.399 --> 02:56:18.230
Uh having a price list does not mean that uh the prices are already taken

02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240
that uh the prices are already taken

02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:21.830
that uh the prices are already taken into account for the storefront. Uh so

02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840
into account for the storefront. Uh so

02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:24.389
into account for the storefront. Uh so for them to be

02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399
for them to be

02:56:24.399 --> 02:56:28.070
for them to be uh to be available they should be the

02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080
uh to be available they should be the

02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:30.389
uh to be available they should be the price list should be assigned and there

02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399
price list should be assigned and there

02:56:30.399 --> 02:56:33.590
price list should be assigned and there are uh several levels where the price

02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600
are uh several levels where the price

02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:34.950
are uh several levels where the price list could be assigned. It could be

02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960
list could be assigned. It could be

02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:37.349
list could be assigned. It could be assigned on the customer level customer

02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359
assigned on the customer level customer

02:56:37.359 --> 02:56:40.070
assigned on the customer level customer group website and global configuration

02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080
group website and global configuration

02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:44.469
group website and global configuration level. Uh let's uh start with the global

02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479
level. Uh let's uh start with the global

02:56:44.479 --> 02:56:46.710
level. Uh let's uh start with the global configuration level.

02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720
configuration level.

02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.150
configuration level. I will close these things.

02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160
I will close these things.

02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:54.309
I will close these things. Mhm. system configuration

02:56:54.309 --> 02:56:54.319
Mhm. system configuration

02:56:54.319 --> 02:56:58.790
Mhm. system configuration and within a price list uh prices

02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800
and within a price list uh prices

02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:02.630
and within a price list uh prices uh okay so we have a prices section

02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640
uh okay so we have a prices section

02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:04.309
uh okay so we have a prices section pricing section and here we have a

02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319
pricing section and here we have a

02:57:04.319 --> 02:57:07.510
pricing section and here we have a default price list uh uh which specifies

02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520
default price list uh uh which specifies

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:10.070
default price list uh uh which specifies that uh globally on a global

02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080
that uh globally on a global

02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:14.150
that uh globally on a global configuration we are taking into account

02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160
configuration we are taking into account

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.110
configuration we are taking into account uh this default price list and we can

02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:17.120
uh this default price list and we can

02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:20.230
uh this default price list and we can have a collection of price lists

02:57:20.230 --> 02:57:20.240
have a collection of price lists

02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.110
have a collection of price lists assigned on global configuration level.

02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120
assigned on global configuration level.

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:25.590
assigned on global configuration level. There are no fallbacks. So like this is

02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:25.600
There are no fallbacks. So like this is

02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.469
There are no fallbacks. So like this is a top level uh settings for the price

02:57:28.469 --> 02:57:28.479
a top level uh settings for the price

02:57:28.479 --> 02:57:32.550
a top level uh settings for the price list. Um yep. So and we have the ability

02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560
list. Um yep. So and we have the ability

02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:35.269
list. Um yep. So and we have the ability to specify the collection of them plus

02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279
to specify the collection of them plus

02:57:35.279 --> 02:57:37.510
to specify the collection of them plus to set the priority which should be

02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:37.520
to set the priority which should be

02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.670
to set the priority which should be taken um of with the first priority and

02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680
taken um of with the first priority and

02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:44.309
taken um of with the first priority and with the second and so on.

02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319
with the second and so on.

02:57:44.319 --> 02:57:47.190
with the second and so on. Um okay this is option number one where

02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:47.200
Um okay this is option number one where

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:50.950
Um okay this is option number one where price list could be assigned

02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960
price list could be assigned

02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:53.910
price list could be assigned but uh depending on your needs maybe you

02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920
but uh depending on your needs maybe you

02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:56.230
but uh depending on your needs maybe you would like to have like some specific uh

02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240
would like to have like some specific uh

02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:01.269
would like to have like some specific uh prices uh uh for the websites. So for

02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279
prices uh uh for the websites. So for

02:58:01.279 --> 02:58:03.910
prices uh uh for the websites. So for that you would need to go to websites

02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920
that you would need to go to websites

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:06.950
that you would need to go to websites and um

02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960
and um

02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:11.190
and um uh let's go here edit

02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200
uh let's go here edit

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:15.429
uh let's go here edit uh so on a website addedit page uh we

02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439
uh so on a website addedit page uh we

02:58:15.439 --> 02:58:18.150
uh so on a website addedit page uh we have the ability to specify uh what kind

02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160
have the ability to specify uh what kind

02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:21.030
have the ability to specify uh what kind of uh prices

02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040
of uh prices

02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:23.750
of uh prices list to use. Um right here we do see

02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:23.760
list to use. Um right here we do see

02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:27.429
list to use. Um right here we do see that um our default website it

02:58:27.429 --> 02:58:27.439
that um our default website it

02:58:27.439 --> 02:58:30.230
that um our default website it additionally to the global configuration

02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240
additionally to the global configuration

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:34.230
additionally to the global configuration level to the global uh globally defined

02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240
level to the global uh globally defined

02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:37.750
level to the global uh globally defined u default prices. It additionally uses

02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760
u default prices. It additionally uses

02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:41.429
u default prices. It additionally uses this um two price list and again we can

02:58:41.429 --> 02:58:41.439
this um two price list and again we can

02:58:41.439 --> 02:58:45.590
this um two price list and again we can specify a collection of them. Plus

02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600
specify a collection of them. Plus

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:49.030
specify a collection of them. Plus there is an ability to set a fallback uh

02:58:49.030 --> 02:58:49.040
there is an ability to set a fallback uh

02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:51.590
there is an ability to set a fallback uh for the price list whether we would like

02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600
for the price list whether we would like

02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:55.990
for the price list whether we would like to uh to merge and to

02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000
to uh to merge and to

02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.070
to uh to merge and to uh to take into account global

02:59:00.070 --> 02:59:00.080
uh to take into account global

02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:03.030
uh to take into account global configuration price list or not. So

02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040
configuration price list or not. So

02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:06.630
configuration price list or not. So specifying it current website only uh

02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640
specifying it current website only uh

02:59:06.640 --> 02:59:08.950
specifying it current website only uh which will it will mean that for the

02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960
which will it will mean that for the

02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:11.590
which will it will mean that for the default website we will use only those

02:59:11.590 --> 02:59:11.600
default website we will use only those

02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:14.710
default website we will use only those prices which are defined here on this u

02:59:14.710 --> 02:59:14.720
prices which are defined here on this u

02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:17.349
prices which are defined here on this u on this level on the website level and

02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359
on this level on the website level and

02:59:17.359 --> 02:59:20.950
on this level on the website level and do not take um into consideration prices

02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960
do not take um into consideration prices

02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:23.990
do not take um into consideration prices from the uh global configuration. So

02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000
from the uh global configuration. So

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:27.510
from the uh global configuration. So this is second level where prices could

02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:27.520
this is second level where prices could

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:29.349
this is second level where prices could be assigned.

02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359
be assigned.

02:59:29.359 --> 02:59:34.870
be assigned. I will uh remove them.

02:59:34.880 --> 02:59:38.710
Uh the next thing is customer group.

02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720
Uh the next thing is customer group.

02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:41.030
Uh the next thing is customer group. Uh so if you go to one of the customer

02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040
Uh so if you go to one of the customer

02:59:41.040 --> 02:59:43.910
Uh so if you go to one of the customer groups uh all customers

02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920
groups uh all customers

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:46.309
groups uh all customers go to addit

02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319
go to addit

02:59:46.319 --> 02:59:49.990
go to addit and here we have a price list section uh

02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000
and here we have a price list section uh

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.830
and here we have a price list section uh with an ability to specify price list u

02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840
with an ability to specify price list u

02:59:53.840 --> 02:59:56.950
with an ability to specify price list u depending per customer group but

02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:56.960
depending per customer group but

02:59:56.960 --> 02:59:59.349
depending per customer group but depending on a website. So imagine we

02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359
depending on a website. So imagine we

02:59:59.359 --> 03:00:04.309
depending on a website. So imagine we have a default website and uh this c all

03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319
have a default website and uh this c all

03:00:04.319 --> 03:00:07.190
have a default website and uh this c all customers they used not only this group

03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200
customers they used not only this group

03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:09.670
customers they used not only this group for the default website but also for the

03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680
for the default website but also for the

03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:13.269
for the default website but also for the US, Australia and other websites. So you

03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:13.279
US, Australia and other websites. So you

03:00:13.279 --> 03:00:17.670
US, Australia and other websites. So you can specify uh what kind of u uh prices

03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:17.680
can specify uh what kind of u uh prices

03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:21.030
can specify uh what kind of u uh prices to use according to specific uh to

03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:21.040
to use according to specific uh to

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:24.790
to use according to specific uh to specific website and it also gives an

03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:24.800
specific website and it also gives an

03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:27.590
specific website and it also gives an ability to specify a collection plus the

03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600
ability to specify a collection plus the

03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:29.670
ability to specify a collection plus the fallback. Uh remember what for the

03:00:29.670 --> 03:00:29.680
fallback. Uh remember what for the

03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:32.469
fallback. Uh remember what for the website we have adds a fallback uh

03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479
website we have adds a fallback uh

03:00:32.479 --> 03:00:34.309
website we have adds a fallback uh global configuration while for the

03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319
global configuration while for the

03:00:34.319 --> 03:00:37.910
global configuration while for the customer group it like listens or checks

03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920
customer group it like listens or checks

03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:43.429
customer group it like listens or checks uh customers checks prices from uh from

03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439
uh customers checks prices from uh from

03:00:43.439 --> 03:00:47.830
uh customers checks prices from uh from upper level which is a website level and

03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840
upper level which is a website level and

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:50.150
upper level which is a website level and specifying current customer group only

03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160
specifying current customer group only

03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:54.150
specifying current customer group only will use only prices for the uh which

03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160
will use only prices for the uh which

03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:57.590
will use only prices for the uh which are listed here and uh disregard those

03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600
are listed here and uh disregard those

03:00:57.600 --> 03:00:59.590
are listed here and uh disregard those from from the website or from the global

03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600
from from the website or from the global

03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:02.469
from from the website or from the global configuration level.

03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479
configuration level.

03:01:02.479 --> 03:01:06.710
configuration level. Okay. And the last level where

03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720
Okay. And the last level where

03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:10.309
Okay. And the last level where price list could be assigned is customer

03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319
price list could be assigned is customer

03:01:10.319 --> 03:01:13.190
price list could be assigned is customer level. So imagine we have a company A

03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200
level. So imagine we have a company A

03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.269
level. So imagine we have a company A and within a company A we would like to

03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279
and within a company A we would like to

03:01:15.279 --> 03:01:19.429
and within a company A we would like to specify some specific uh prices and here

03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439
specify some specific uh prices and here

03:01:19.439 --> 03:01:23.190
specify some specific uh prices and here is where they are uh provided on the

03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:23.200
is where they are uh provided on the

03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:28.150
is where they are uh provided on the customer edit page and again uh users of

03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160
customer edit page and again uh users of

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:31.910
customer edit page and again uh users of uh customer company A they might uh

03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920
uh customer company A they might uh

03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:34.469
uh customer company A they might uh belong to different websites that's why

03:01:34.469 --> 03:01:34.479
belong to different websites that's why

03:01:34.479 --> 03:01:38.070
belong to different websites that's why we give the ability to define a list of

03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080
we give the ability to define a list of

03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:41.830
we give the ability to define a list of price list depending on the website uh

03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840
price list depending on the website uh

03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:45.269
price list depending on the website uh users will be using. And again the

03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279
users will be using. And again the

03:01:45.279 --> 03:01:48.230
users will be using. And again the fallback uh with the fallback we can

03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240
fallback uh with the fallback we can

03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:53.110
fallback uh with the fallback we can specify either to break and keep uh take

03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120
specify either to break and keep uh take

03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.790
specify either to break and keep uh take into account um uh from customer group

03:01:56.790 --> 03:01:56.800
into account um uh from customer group

03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.870
into account um uh from customer group and upper levels price list or stay just

03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880
and upper levels price list or stay just

03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:03.510
and upper levels price list or stay just on simply on this level uh for the

03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520
on simply on this level uh for the

03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:06.070
on simply on this level uh for the customer um

03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080
customer um

03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:10.790
customer um prices. this one and disregard others.

03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800
prices. this one and disregard others.

03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:15.670
prices. this one and disregard others. So this how uh price list fallbacks

03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680
So this how uh price list fallbacks

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:18.469
So this how uh price list fallbacks and actually this is demonstrated here.

03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479
and actually this is demonstrated here.

03:02:18.479 --> 03:02:21.030
and actually this is demonstrated here. So whenever

03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040
So whenever

03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.950
So whenever prices are uh found on the customer

03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960
prices are uh found on the customer

03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:27.750
prices are uh found on the customer level they are picked up missing they

03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:27.760
level they are picked up missing they

03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:29.590
level they are picked up missing they are also merged with the customer group

03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600
are also merged with the customer group

03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:32.389
are also merged with the customer group level missing

03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399
level missing

03:02:32.399 --> 03:02:34.630
level missing used

03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640
used

03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:36.550
used taken from the website level and the

03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560
taken from the website level and the

03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:39.190
taken from the website level and the last level is global and it's up to you

03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200
last level is global and it's up to you

03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:42.710
last level is global and it's up to you to decide at what level to stop uh

level and on the customer group we have

03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:15.670
level and on the customer group we have a price 94 for this particular product

03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680
a price 94 for this particular product

03:08:15.680 --> 03:08:17.910
a price 94 for this particular product and by the way whenever I have I did uh

03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920
and by the way whenever I have I did uh

03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:21.030
and by the way whenever I have I did uh the change yeah the prices uh

03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040
the change yeah the prices uh

03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:22.950
the change yeah the prices uh recalculated and the final price was

03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960
recalculated and the final price was

recalculated and the final price was provided for this certain quantity. Now

03:08:25.349 --> 03:08:25.359
provided for this certain quantity. Now

03:08:25.359 --> 03:08:29.830
provided for this certain quantity. Now let's check how uh alls are working. If

03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840
let's check how uh alls are working. If

03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:33.429
let's check how uh alls are working. If I go and

03:08:33.429 --> 03:08:33.439
I go and

03:08:33.439 --> 03:08:35.429
I go and edit

03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439
edit

03:08:35.439 --> 03:08:40.309
edit the test uh customer group um price list

03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319
the test uh customer group um price list

03:08:40.319 --> 03:08:44.469
the test uh customer group um price list settings and would like to

03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479
settings and would like to

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:47.190
settings and would like to uh use only price list which I defined

03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200
uh use only price list which I defined

03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:50.150
uh use only price list which I defined on this level and do not take into

03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160
on this level and do not take into

03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:53.429
on this level and do not take into account those from the upper level. So I

03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439
account those from the upper level. So I

03:08:53.439 --> 03:08:56.230
account those from the upper level. So I am specifying fallback just uh to stay

03:08:56.230 --> 03:08:56.240
am specifying fallback just uh to stay

03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:58.630
am specifying fallback just uh to stay on the current customer group only for

03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640
on the current customer group only for

03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:00.469
on the current customer group only for the default website. I will save the

03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479
the default website. I will save the

03:09:00.479 --> 03:09:03.670
the default website. I will save the changes.

03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:07.269
Uh I will refresh the page.

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279
Uh I will refresh the page.

03:09:07.279 --> 03:09:10.630
Uh I will refresh the page. The prices uh for this particular

03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640
The prices uh for this particular

03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:12.790
The prices uh for this particular product were not kind of changed. But if

03:09:12.790 --> 03:09:12.800
product were not kind of changed. But if

03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:15.510
product were not kind of changed. But if you look to the tire prices, they we we

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520
you look to the tire prices, they we we

03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:18.309
you look to the tire prices, they we we have only the price for the uh for

03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319
have only the price for the uh for

03:09:18.319 --> 03:09:21.670
have only the price for the uh for quantity equal to one and we do not have

03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680
quantity equal to one and we do not have

03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:24.150
quantity equal to one and we do not have any other prices. And the reason for

03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160
any other prices. And the reason for

03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:27.990
any other prices. And the reason for that is that we are using uh this price

03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000
that is that we are using uh this price

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.950
that is that we are using uh this price list. We are not using uh price list

03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960
list. We are not using uh price list

03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:34.230
list. We are not using uh price list from upper levels website or global

03:09:34.230 --> 03:09:34.240
from upper levels website or global

03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:38.150
from upper levels website or global configuration. And uh this um uh price

03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160
configuration. And uh this um uh price

03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:41.110
configuration. And uh this um uh price list it contains only price for single

03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120
list it contains only price for single

03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:44.790
list it contains only price for single product. So this is how

03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800
product. So this is how

03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:47.349
product. So this is how we can uh

03:09:47.349 --> 03:09:47.359
we can uh

03:09:47.359 --> 03:09:49.670
we can uh uh we can have uh this price list

03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680
uh we can have uh this price list

03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:52.230
uh we can have uh this price list defined.

03:09:52.230 --> 03:09:52.240
defined.

03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:55.750
defined. Okay, let's

03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760
Okay, let's

03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:58.070
Okay, let's and decide and actually used the

03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080
and decide and actually used the

03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:01.030
and decide and actually used the fallbacks used for for for them. Okay,

03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040
fallbacks used for for for them. Okay,

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.910
fallbacks used for for for them. Okay, now let me continue

03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920
now let me continue

03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:07.269
now let me continue and for demonstration purposes create

03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:07.279
and for demonstration purposes create

03:10:07.279 --> 03:10:09.670
and for demonstration purposes create another price list.

03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680
another price list.

03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:13.190
another price list. Uh check

03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200
Uh check

03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:16.550
Uh check uh price list

03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560
uh price list

03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:19.910
uh price list I will create. So this one was with the

03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920
I will create. So this one was with the

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:23.349
I will create. So this one was with the price addit

03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359
price addit

03:10:23.359 --> 03:10:26.950
price addit the price 94 right

03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960
the price 94 right

03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:31.030
the price 94 right uh 94 USD just

03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040
uh 94 USD just

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.910
uh 94 USD just uh to be clear what kind of uh I will

03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920
uh to be clear what kind of uh I will

03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:37.590
uh to be clear what kind of uh I will create another price list

03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600
create another price list

03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:40.469
create another price list let's actually use uh duplicate uh

03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479
let's actually use uh duplicate uh

03:10:40.479 --> 03:10:43.670
let's actually use uh duplicate uh functionality right we have it okay I

03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680
functionality right we have it okay I

03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:46.790
functionality right we have it okay I have duplicated after duplicate it is

03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800
have duplicated after duplicate it is

03:10:46.800 --> 03:10:49.830
have duplicated after duplicate it is automatically marked as disabled. I will

03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840
automatically marked as disabled. I will

03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:53.590

uh calculated and presented to the end user is defined using so-called price

03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399
user is defined using so-called price

03:13:38.399 --> 03:13:44.790
user is defined using so-called price strategy and price strategy

03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:47.190
system configuration is defined in

03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200
system configuration is defined in

03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.269
system configuration is defined in system configuration I will go to

03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279
system configuration I will go to

03:13:49.279 --> 03:13:53.510
system configuration I will go to pricing the pricing section once again

03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520
pricing the pricing section once again

03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:57.030
pricing the pricing section once again here is a pricing section

03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040
here is a pricing section

03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:00.309
here is a pricing section and here we have uh price selection

03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319
and here we have uh price selection

03:14:00.319 --> 03:14:03.910
and here we have uh price selection strategy. So strategy which uh defines

03:14:03.910 --> 03:14:03.920
strategy. So strategy which uh defines

03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:08.630
strategy. So strategy which uh defines how to select prices if they are uh

03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640
how to select prices if they are uh

03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:11.510
how to select prices if they are uh defined uh if we have similar for

03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520
defined uh if we have similar for

03:14:11.520 --> 03:14:13.190
defined uh if we have similar for similar products prices on different

03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200
similar products prices on different

03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.269
similar products prices on different levels. And here we have a pricing

03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279
levels. And here we have a pricing

03:14:15.279 --> 03:14:19.590
levels. And here we have a pricing strategy minimal which means that on uh

03:14:19.590 --> 03:14:19.600
strategy minimal which means that on uh

03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:22.469
strategy minimal which means that on uh it doesn't matter on which level we have

03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479
it doesn't matter on which level we have

03:14:22.479 --> 03:14:26.309
it doesn't matter on which level we have prices for the uh for the for the

03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319
prices for the uh for the for the

03:14:26.319 --> 03:14:31.030
prices for the uh for the for the product but the minimal uh price will be

03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040
product but the minimal uh price will be

03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:33.830
product but the minimal uh price will be taken uh as the final price. So remember

03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840
taken uh as the final price. So remember

03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:38.710
taken uh as the final price. So remember here we have 94 uh 95. So the minimal

03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720
here we have 94 uh 95. So the minimal

03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:42.150
here we have 94 uh 95. So the minimal price was taken for that product.

03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160
price was taken for that product.

03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:45.030
price was taken for that product. uh

03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040
uh

03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:48.150
uh and to demonstrate that. So if I change

03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160
and to demonstrate that. So if I change

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:51.269
and to demonstrate that. So if I change um and reassign

03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279
um and reassign

03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:54.229
um and reassign for company A

03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239
for company A

03:14:54.239 --> 03:15:01.269
for company A I will specify 94

03:15:01.279 --> 03:15:09.510
but for test customer I will specify 93.

03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:12.070
Save changes.

03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080
Save changes.

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:15.750
Save changes. So now I have on a customer on a

03:15:15.750 --> 03:15:15.760
So now I have on a customer on a

03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:20.389
So now I have on a customer on a customer group I have 93 on a customer I

03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399
customer group I have 93 on a customer I

03:15:20.399 --> 03:15:23.750
customer group I have 93 on a customer I have um

03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760
have um

03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:25.750
have um 94

03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760
94

03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:31.510
94 here 94 here 93 I will refresh the page

03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520
here 94 here 93 I will refresh the page

03:15:31.520 --> 03:15:34.870
here 94 here 93 I will refresh the page I will still have 93 because no matter

03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:34.880
I will still have 93 because no matter

03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:38.070
I will still have 93 because no matter on what level we have the price uh the

03:15:38.070 --> 03:15:38.080
on what level we have the price uh the

03:15:38.080 --> 03:15:41.830
on what level we have the price uh the lowest price is taken as a final price.

03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840
lowest price is taken as a final price.

03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:45.910
lowest price is taken as a final price. Okay. So what we can do we can do is we

03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920
Okay. So what we can do we can do is we

03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:48.550
Okay. So what we can do we can do is we can change this uh price and strategy

03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560
can change this uh price and strategy

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:50.950
can change this uh price and strategy and we have another one which is called

03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960
and we have another one which is called

03:15:50.960 --> 03:15:53.910
and we have another one which is called merge by priority.

03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920
merge by priority.

03:15:53.920 --> 03:16:01.110
merge by priority. Okay I will change uh and save settings.

03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:06.070
Uh what this uh uh strategy means? It

03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080
Uh what this uh uh strategy means? It

03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:08.550
Uh what this uh uh strategy means? It means that we will be taking not minimal

03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560
means that we will be taking not minimal

03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:10.550
means that we will be taking not minimal uh for the final prices not minimal

03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560
uh for the final prices not minimal

03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:14.150
uh for the final prices not minimal prices but the prices which will which

03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160
prices but the prices which will which

03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:19.349
prices but the prices which will which are on a uh uh on a higher level this

03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359
are on a uh uh on a higher level this

03:16:19.359 --> 03:16:21.590
are on a uh uh on a higher level this like in this diagram on a higher level

03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600
like in this diagram on a higher level

03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:25.349
like in this diagram on a higher level will be uh taken um at the priority uh

03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359
will be uh taken um at the priority uh

03:16:25.359 --> 03:16:28.309
will be uh taken um at the priority uh first then if they are not uh found they

03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319
first then if they are not uh found they

03:16:28.319 --> 03:16:31.269
first then if they are not uh found they will be taken from from this level but

03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279
will be taken from from this level but

03:16:31.279 --> 03:16:36.150
will be taken from from this level but um uh yeah but as the main prices will

03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160
um uh yeah but as the main prices will

03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:38.630
um uh yeah but as the main prices will be taken from here. Remember on a

03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640
be taken from here. Remember on a

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:42.630
be taken from here. Remember on a customer level we have uh like 90 uh

03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640
customer level we have uh like 90 uh

03:16:42.640 --> 03:16:45.110
customer level we have uh like 90 uh sorry 94

03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120
sorry 94

03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:50.550
sorry 94 right and on a uh customer group 93

03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560
right and on a uh customer group 93

03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:54.790
right and on a uh customer group 93 customer has like higher priority

03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800
customer has like higher priority

03:16:54.800 --> 03:16:57.269
customer has like higher priority that's why changing the configuration to

03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279
that's why changing the configuration to

03:16:57.279 --> 03:16:59.590
that's why changing the configuration to measure by priority now we should have

03:16:59.590 --> 03:16:59.600
measure by priority now we should have

03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:02.389
measure by priority now we should have for the same company a customer we

03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399
for the same company a customer we

03:17:02.399 --> 03:17:07.030
for the same company a customer we should have prices 94 let's refresh

03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040
should have prices 94 let's refresh

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:11.670
should have prices 94 let's refresh and we have 94

03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:17.429
because uh

03:17:17.439 --> 03:17:20.710
customer prices has higher priority.

03:17:20.710 --> 03:17:20.720
customer prices has higher priority.

03:17:20.720 --> 03:17:23.030
customer prices has higher priority. That's why they are taken first no

03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040
That's why they are taken first no

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:27.190
That's why they are taken first no matter whether they are lower or not.

03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200
matter whether they are lower or not.

03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:31.830
matter whether they are lower or not. And uh by the way uh we can specify this

03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840
And uh by the way uh we can specify this

03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:35.349
And uh by the way uh we can specify this uh it also it is also applied not only

03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:35.359
uh it also it is also applied not only

03:17:35.359 --> 03:17:38.389
uh it also it is also applied not only on different levels of uh of the

03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399
on different levels of uh of the

03:17:38.399 --> 03:17:40.550
on different levels of uh of the entities like customer group or customer

03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560
entities like customer group or customer

03:17:40.560 --> 03:17:44.710
entities like customer group or customer but it is also applied uh when we have

03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720
but it is also applied uh when we have

03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:48.469
but it is also applied uh when we have uh several price listed within the same

03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479
uh several price listed within the same

03:17:48.479 --> 03:17:54.070
uh several price listed within the same level. So from the upper uh price list

03:17:54.070 --> 03:17:54.080
level. So from the upper uh price list

03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:57.830
level. So from the upper uh price list uh prices will be taken first uh having

03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840
uh prices will be taken first uh having

03:17:57.840 --> 03:18:03.349
uh prices will be taken first uh having this uh mesh by priority uh strategy.

03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359
this uh mesh by priority uh strategy.

03:18:03.359 --> 03:18:10.229
this uh mesh by priority uh strategy. And uh as you uh may notice we have um

03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239
And uh as you uh may notice we have um

03:18:10.239 --> 03:18:15.910
And uh as you uh may notice we have um I will switch uh to this one.

03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:18.389
After we have changed uh and set merge

03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399
After we have changed uh and set merge

03:18:18.399 --> 03:18:22.790
After we have changed uh and set merge by priority we have uh

03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800
by priority we have uh

03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:25.190
by priority we have uh additional option appeared here whether

03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200
additional option appeared here whether

03:18:25.200 --> 03:18:27.990
additional option appeared here whether merge allowed or not. So let's go to the

03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000
merge allowed or not. So let's go to the

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:31.590
merge allowed or not. So let's go to the company a price list. Uh here we also

03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600
company a price list. Uh here we also

03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:35.910
company a price list. Uh here we also have merge allowed or not. I will uh uh

03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:35.920
have merge allowed or not. I will uh uh

03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:39.510
have merge allowed or not. I will uh uh disable uh this u option and save the

03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520
disable uh this u option and save the

03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:42.309
disable uh this u option and save the changes. With that I am saying that I

03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319
changes. With that I am saying that I

03:18:42.319 --> 03:18:45.670
changes. With that I am saying that I would like to pick up prices uh from the

03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680
would like to pick up prices uh from the

03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:49.510
would like to pick up prices uh from the company A uh price list this one and I

03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520
company A uh price list this one and I

03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:53.269
company A uh price list this one and I am not allowed to merge uh with other

03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279
am not allowed to merge uh with other

03:18:53.279 --> 03:18:56.950
am not allowed to merge uh with other tire prices from other price lists like

03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960
tire prices from other price lists like

03:18:56.960 --> 03:19:01.269
tire prices from other price lists like I would like to pick up from unit units

03:19:01.269 --> 03:19:01.279
I would like to pick up from unit units

03:19:01.279 --> 03:19:04.070
I would like to pick up from unit units and quantities that are here in this

03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080
and quantities that are here in this

03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:07.349
and quantities that are here in this price list and would not like to take u

03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359
price list and would not like to take u

03:19:07.359 --> 03:19:09.349
price list and would not like to take u uh other quantities for the same

03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359
uh other quantities for the same

03:19:09.359 --> 03:19:10.870
uh other quantities for the same products. It's not allowing to merge

03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880
products. It's not allowing to merge

03:19:10.880 --> 03:19:13.110
products. It's not allowing to merge with other quantities from from other

03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120
with other quantities from from other

03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:15.510
with other quantities from from other price list. Okay, I will refresh the

03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520
price list. Okay, I will refresh the

03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:17.269
price list. Okay, I will refresh the page.

03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279
page.

03:19:17.279 --> 03:19:19.590
page. And now it seems like nothing changed.

03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600
And now it seems like nothing changed.

03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:25.110
And now it seems like nothing changed. But if I go to Oops. Um

03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120
But if I go to Oops. Um

03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:27.910
But if I go to Oops. Um 94.

03:19:27.910 --> 03:19:27.920
94.

03:19:27.920 --> 03:19:31.269
94. Uh one second.

03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279
Uh one second.

03:19:31.279 --> 03:19:34.229
Uh one second. Yep. That is I do not have consumers.

03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239
Yep. That is I do not have consumers.

03:19:34.239 --> 03:19:37.030
Yep. That is I do not have consumers. They were stopped.

03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040
They were stopped.

03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:40.630
They were stopped. Okay. The prices are recalculated

03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640
Okay. The prices are recalculated

03:19:40.640 --> 03:19:43.990
Okay. The prices are recalculated and now we are fine. So now we have

03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000
and now we are fine. So now we have

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.870
and now we are fine. So now we have prices for other products. We have price

03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880
prices for other products. We have price

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:49.510
prices for other products. We have price for this product uh which is uh the

03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520
for this product uh which is uh the

03:19:49.520 --> 03:19:51.830
for this product uh which is uh the price is defined on the customer level

03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840
price is defined on the customer level

03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:53.750
price is defined on the customer level here

03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760
here

03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:57.429
here on the customer 94.

03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439
on the customer 94.

03:19:57.439 --> 03:20:00.469
on the customer 94. But we have specified that we are not

03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479
But we have specified that we are not

03:20:00.479 --> 03:20:07.110
But we have specified that we are not allowing to merge uh its prices uh with

03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120
allowing to merge uh its prices uh with

03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:12.790
allowing to merge uh its prices uh with other uh quantities. That's why this uh

03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800
other uh quantities. That's why this uh

03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:16.389
other uh quantities. That's why this uh this product has uh only prices for

03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399
this product has uh only prices for

03:20:16.399 --> 03:20:21.510
this product has uh only prices for quantity equal to one and do not have

03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520
quantity equal to one and do not have

03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:23.349
quantity equal to one and do not have prices for other quantities which is

03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359
prices for other quantities which is

03:20:23.359 --> 03:20:28.309
prices for other quantities which is specified on a default price list.

03:20:28.319 --> 03:20:32.870
Okay, let me uh check uh what we have in

03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880
Okay, let me uh check uh what we have in

03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:35.269
Okay, let me uh check uh what we have in slides.

03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279
slides.

03:20:35.279 --> 03:20:38.309
slides. So just keep in mind we have uh several

03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319
So just keep in mind we have uh several

03:20:38.319 --> 03:20:39.830
So just keep in mind we have uh several levels

03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840
levels

03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:44.070
levels depending on uh levels we can specify

03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080
depending on uh levels we can specify

03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:47.510
depending on uh levels we can specify some specific uh prices. If we are using

03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520
some specific uh prices. If we are using

03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:51.990
some specific uh prices. If we are using measure by uh um minimal prices strategy

03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000
measure by uh um minimal prices strategy

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.870
measure by uh um minimal prices strategy minimal then simply minimal price is

03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880
minimal then simply minimal price is

03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:57.910
minimal then simply minimal price is taken no matter on what level we have a

03:20:57.910 --> 03:20:57.920
taken no matter on what level we have a

03:20:57.920 --> 03:21:00.550
taken no matter on what level we have a priceless. If we have a merge by uh

03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:00.560
priceless. If we have a merge by uh

03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:05.429
priceless. If we have a merge by uh priority then the customer

03:21:05.429 --> 03:21:05.439
priority then the customer

03:21:05.439 --> 03:21:08.870
priority then the customer then with a higher priority level uh

03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880
then with a higher priority level uh

03:21:08.880 --> 03:21:13.269
then with a higher priority level uh prices will be taken first.

03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279
prices will be taken first.

03:21:13.279 --> 03:21:16.469
prices will be taken first. Okay. And here we have uh this uh price

03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479
Okay. And here we have uh this uh price

03:21:16.479 --> 03:21:18.630
Okay. And here we have uh this uh price and strategy. So they are defined in a

03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:18.640
and strategy. So they are defined in a

03:21:18.640 --> 03:21:21.830
and strategy. So they are defined in a system configurations and by default uh

03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840
system configurations and by default uh

03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:25.269
system configurations and by default uh minimal is enabled but you can uh change

03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279
minimal is enabled but you can uh change

03:21:25.279 --> 03:21:28.229
minimal is enabled but you can uh change to to the merge by priority and

03:21:28.229 --> 03:21:28.239
to to the merge by priority and

03:21:28.239 --> 03:21:31.269
to to the merge by priority and especially taking into

03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279
especially taking into

03:21:31.279 --> 03:21:34.150
especially taking into deciding whether to use merge allowed or

03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160
deciding whether to use merge allowed or

03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:36.309
deciding whether to use merge allowed or not.

03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319
not.

03:21:36.319 --> 03:21:42.150
not. Um so whenever we have uh this prices u

03:21:42.150 --> 03:21:42.160
Um so whenever we have uh this prices u

03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:44.870
Um so whenever we have uh this prices u set up on different levels uh in the

03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880
set up on different levels uh in the

03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:47.910
set up on different levels uh in the final result we uh like we could have

03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920
final result we uh like we could have

03:21:47.920 --> 03:21:49.510
final result we uh like we could have like

03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520
like

03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:52.469
like several uh uh price list right on

03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479
several uh uh price list right on

03:21:52.479 --> 03:21:55.190
several uh uh price list right on different levels but at the final u

03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200
different levels but at the final u

03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:58.150
different levels but at the final u result is having a combined so-called

03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160
result is having a combined so-called

03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:01.830
result is having a combined so-called combined price list which has all the

03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840
combined price list which has all the

03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:03.990
combined price list which has all the combination uh which holds the

03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000
combination uh which holds the

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.710
combination uh which holds the combinations of the price list taken in

03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720
combinations of the price list taken in

03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:10.710
combinations of the price list taken in uh taking prices from different levels

03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720
uh taking prices from different levels

03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:14.870
uh taking prices from different levels and uh so it is prepared beforehand. So

03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880
and uh so it is prepared beforehand. So

03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:17.190
and uh so it is prepared beforehand. So whenever we are performing some changes

03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200
whenever we are performing some changes

03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:19.990
whenever we are performing some changes uh on the price list the combined price

03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000
uh on the price list the combined price

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:23.910
uh on the price list the combined price list is uh recalculated and uh we do

03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920
list is uh recalculated and uh we do

03:22:23.920 --> 03:22:26.309
list is uh recalculated and uh we do have like this final prices. So think

03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319
have like this final prices. So think

03:22:26.319 --> 03:22:29.590
have like this final prices. So think about combined prices as a final prices

03:22:29.590 --> 03:22:29.600
about combined prices as a final prices

03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:33.590
about combined prices as a final prices which are then visible on a storefront.

03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600
which are then visible on a storefront.

03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:36.309
which are then visible on a storefront. uh so they are calculated in the

03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319
uh so they are calculated in the

03:22:36.319 --> 03:22:38.710
uh so they are calculated in the background. Uh this is done for

03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720
background. Uh this is done for

03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:42.070
background. Uh this is done for performance reasons just to uh not to do

03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:42.080
performance reasons just to uh not to do

03:22:42.080 --> 03:22:44.630
performance reasons just to uh not to do this recalcul to do this calculation

03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640
this recalcul to do this calculation

03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:47.510
this recalcul to do this calculation when we uh navigating the storefront but

03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520
when we uh navigating the storefront but

03:22:47.520 --> 03:22:49.429
when we uh navigating the storefront but have them already prepared and just to

03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439
have them already prepared and just to

03:22:49.439 --> 03:22:54.790
have them already prepared and just to provide um depending on what customer or

03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800
provide um depending on what customer or

03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:57.190
provide um depending on what customer or what customer group or what website we

03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:57.200
what customer group or what website we

03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:59.670
what customer group or what website we are using.

03:22:59.670 --> 03:22:59.680
are using.

03:22:59.680 --> 03:23:02.469
are using. Um yeah and this combined price list

03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479
Um yeah and this combined price list

03:23:02.479 --> 03:23:06.790
Um yeah and this combined price list actually uh contains or contains of the

03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800
actually uh contains or contains of the

03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:10.070
actually uh contains or contains of the or aggregates prices from the chain we

03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080
or aggregates prices from the chain we

03:23:10.080 --> 03:23:12.790
or aggregates prices from the chain we have. For instance, if we the combined

03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800
have. For instance, if we the combined

03:23:12.800 --> 03:23:16.950
have. For instance, if we the combined prices for this uh for this uh uh

03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960
prices for this uh for this uh uh

03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:21.030
prices for this uh for this uh uh company A uh user, it contains prices

03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040
company A uh user, it contains prices

03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:24.550
company A uh user, it contains prices from the chain. this one from this level

03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560
from the chain. this one from this level

03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:27.990
from the chain. this one from this level uh from the uh test uh customer group

03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000
uh from the uh test uh customer group

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:32.630
uh from the uh test uh customer group level plus global configuration level

03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640
level plus global configuration level

03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:35.910
level plus global configuration level and uh yeah we have checked that they

03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920
and uh yeah we have checked that they

03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:38.389
and uh yeah we have checked that they their calculations and preparing this

03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399
their calculations and preparing this

03:23:38.399 --> 03:23:41.190
their calculations and preparing this combined prices it is performed

03:23:41.190 --> 03:23:41.200
combined prices it is performed

03:23:41.200 --> 03:23:43.590
combined prices it is performed automatically once the immediately once

03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600
automatically once the immediately once

03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:46.389
automatically once the immediately once the change is

03:23:46.389 --> 03:23:46.399
the change is

03:23:46.399 --> 03:23:49.510
the change is uh done on on the price level on the

03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520
uh done on on the price level on the

03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:52.550
uh done on on the price level on the price list some assignment But if you

03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560
price list some assignment But if you

03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:55.750
price list some assignment But if you would like to recalculate uh

03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760
would like to recalculate uh

03:23:55.760 --> 03:23:57.830
would like to recalculate uh specifically using command line

03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840
specifically using command line

03:23:57.840 --> 03:24:00.710
specifically using command line interface, you have this command to do

03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720
interface, you have this command to do

03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:03.110
interface, you have this command to do that with a scheduled. It will means

03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120
that with a scheduled. It will means

03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:05.429
that with a scheduled. It will means that a message will be put to the queue

03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439
that a message will be put to the queue

03:24:05.439 --> 03:24:07.429
that a message will be put to the queue and recalculation will be performed

03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439
and recalculation will be performed

03:24:07.439 --> 03:24:10.070
and recalculation will be performed through the message queue. And yeah

03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080
through the message queue. And yeah

03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:12.870
through the message queue. And yeah actually this are the com think about

03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:12.880
actually this are the com think about

03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:14.710
actually this are the com think about combined prices as those which are

03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720
combined prices as those which are

03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:19.429
combined prices as those which are displayed uh uh on the storefront

03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439
displayed uh uh on the storefront

03:24:19.439 --> 03:24:21.670
displayed uh uh on the storefront and uh

03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680
and uh

03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:24.229
and uh like we have um several entities which

03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239
like we have um several entities which

03:24:24.239 --> 03:24:27.830
like we have um several entities which are responsible for the price list u and

03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840
are responsible for the price list u and

03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:31.349
are responsible for the price list u and uh like price um they are starting with

03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359
uh like price um they are starting with

03:24:31.359 --> 03:24:33.750
uh like price um they are starting with the price list uh product price and so

03:24:33.750 --> 03:24:33.760
the price list uh product price and so

03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:36.389
the price list uh product price and so on and uh for the combined those

03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.399
on and uh for the combined those

03:24:36.399 --> 03:24:39.670
on and uh for the combined those recalculated we have like similar

03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680
recalculated we have like similar

03:24:39.680 --> 03:24:42.710
recalculated we have like similar uh duplicated entities but they are

03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720
uh duplicated entities but they are

03:24:42.720 --> 03:24:44.950
uh duplicated entities but they are starting with a combined. So we we will

03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960
starting with a combined. So we we will

03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:48.150
starting with a combined. So we we will have combined price list, combined uh uh

03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160
have combined price list, combined uh uh

03:24:48.160 --> 03:24:51.269
have combined price list, combined uh uh prices and so on.

03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279
prices and so on.

03:24:51.279 --> 03:25:17.750
prices and so on. Let me check. Oops.

03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:21.830
I will open quickly and demonstrate.

03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840
I will open quickly and demonstrate.

03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:24.870
I will open quickly and demonstrate. Okay. So,

03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880
Okay. So,

03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:26.469
Okay. So, um

03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479
um

03:25:26.479 --> 03:25:29.590
um I will navigate. So, all of that u

03:25:29.590 --> 03:25:29.600
I will navigate. So, all of that u

03:25:29.600 --> 03:25:33.190
I will navigate. So, all of that u pricing engine is located in a uh

03:25:33.190 --> 03:25:33.200
pricing engine is located in a uh

03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:36.630
pricing engine is located in a uh commerce uh pricing bundle.

03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640
commerce uh pricing bundle.

03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:38.389
commerce uh pricing bundle. And here are the entities that I was

03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399
And here are the entities that I was

03:25:38.399 --> 03:25:41.269
And here are the entities that I was just referring to. So for the regular uh

03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279
just referring to. So for the regular uh

03:25:41.279 --> 03:25:44.710
just referring to. So for the regular uh price list,

03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720
price list,

03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:47.030
price list, we have this price list for the

03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040
we have this price list for the

03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.830
we have this price list for the fallbacks entities which for the

03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840
fallbacks entities which for the

03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:52.630
fallbacks entities which for the schedules for price list relation to the

03:25:52.630 --> 03:25:52.640
schedules for price list relation to the

03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:55.110
schedules for price list relation to the customer, customer group and so on. And

03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120
customer, customer group and so on. And

03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:58.790
customer, customer group and so on. And similar we have uh the entities which

03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800
similar we have uh the entities which

03:25:58.800 --> 03:26:02.150
similar we have uh the entities which are responsible for storing final uh

03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160
are responsible for storing final uh

03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:05.429
are responsible for storing final uh final results or final prices and they

03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439
final results or final prices and they

03:26:05.439 --> 03:26:07.110
final results or final prices and they are started with a combined combined

03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120
are started with a combined combined

03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:11.429
are started with a combined combined price list to customer to to website uh

03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439
price list to customer to to website uh

03:26:11.439 --> 03:26:13.349
price list to customer to to website uh schedules should be also activation

03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359
schedules should be also activation

03:26:13.359 --> 03:26:17.269
schedules should be also activation rules like that.

03:26:17.279 --> 03:26:19.830
Mhm.

03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840
Mhm.

03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:23.429
Mhm. Uh we have uh uh a new feature which is

03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439
Uh we have uh uh a new feature which is

03:26:23.439 --> 03:26:26.790
Uh we have uh uh a new feature which is uh uh coming soon which will be

03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800
uh uh coming soon which will be

03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:29.990
uh uh coming soon which will be available in 5.6 version. So now we have

03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000
available in 5.6 version. So now we have

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:35.830
available in 5.6 version. So now we have like 5 uh 1.5 but within the sixth uh

03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840
like 5 uh 1.5 but within the sixth uh

03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:40.309
like 5 uh 1.5 but within the sixth uh version we will have uh

03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319
version we will have uh

03:26:40.319 --> 03:26:43.590
version we will have uh an ability to uh check uh price

03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600
an ability to uh check uh price

03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:48.229
an ability to uh check uh price calculation details in a back office. So

03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239
calculation details in a back office. So

03:26:48.239 --> 03:26:51.110
calculation details in a back office. So yeah, I was demonstrating it for you

03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120
yeah, I was demonstrating it for you

03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:53.510
yeah, I was demonstrating it for you like these examples going here and there

03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520
like these examples going here and there

03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:55.910
like these examples going here and there checking and then we went to the

03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920
checking and then we went to the

03:26:55.920 --> 03:26:59.349
checking and then we went to the storefront and checked final prices and

03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359
storefront and checked final prices and

03:26:59.359 --> 03:27:02.309
storefront and checked final prices and you might have like a complex setup

03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:02.319
you might have like a complex setup

03:27:02.319 --> 03:27:04.870
you might have like a complex setup different levels plus taking into

03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880
different levels plus taking into

03:27:04.880 --> 03:27:09.510
different levels plus taking into account some activation or schedules um

03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520
account some activation or schedules um

03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:12.950
account some activation or schedules um for the price list. So these are all uh

03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960
for the price list. So these are all uh

03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:16.469
for the price list. So these are all uh is crucial for the final prices and for

03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479
is crucial for the final prices and for

03:27:16.479 --> 03:27:18.469
is crucial for the final prices and for that was introduced this uh price

03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479
that was introduced this uh price

03:27:18.479 --> 03:27:21.349
that was introduced this uh price calculation details section. I will uh

03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359
calculation details section. I will uh

03:27:21.359 --> 03:27:22.870
calculation details section. I will uh actually

03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880
actually

03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:26.070
actually open it here. Uh though the

03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080
open it here. Uh though the

03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:28.389
open it here. Uh though the documentation is already available but

03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399
documentation is already available but

03:27:28.399 --> 03:27:30.309
documentation is already available but uh this version will be released just

03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319
uh this version will be released just

03:27:30.319 --> 03:27:32.950
uh this version will be released just maybe tomorrow maybe the day after

03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960
maybe tomorrow maybe the day after

03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:36.550
maybe tomorrow maybe the day after tomorrow. And uh so you we will have the

03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560
tomorrow. And uh so you we will have the

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:39.190
tomorrow. And uh so you we will have the course would need to enable permissions.

03:27:39.190 --> 03:27:39.200
course would need to enable permissions.

03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:44.070
course would need to enable permissions. And here we will have a grid which will

03:27:44.070 --> 03:27:44.080
And here we will have a grid which will

03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:47.910
And here we will have a grid which will uh list uh all possible prices for the

03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920
uh list uh all possible prices for the

03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:51.830
uh list uh all possible prices for the products depending on a on a currency.

03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840
products depending on a on a currency.

03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:55.750
products depending on a on a currency. Uh plus we have a uh section which

03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760
Uh plus we have a uh section which

03:27:55.760 --> 03:27:57.830
Uh plus we have a uh section which describes how those prices were

03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840
describes how those prices were

03:27:57.840 --> 03:28:00.950
describes how those prices were calculated. So we can go to uh to these

03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960
calculated. So we can go to uh to these

03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:04.950
calculated. So we can go to uh to these tool tips and they will uh demonstrate

03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960
tool tips and they will uh demonstrate

03:28:04.960 --> 03:28:07.590
tool tips and they will uh demonstrate where they were taken for what period

03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600
where they were taken for what period

03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:11.030
where they were taken for what period and so on. Yeah. So it will help a lot

03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040
and so on. Yeah. So it will help a lot

03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:14.070
and so on. Yeah. So it will help a lot if you have some complex setup

03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080
if you have some complex setup

03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:15.750
if you have some complex setup uh and you would like to know

03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:15.760
uh and you would like to know

03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:18.469
uh and you would like to know specifically how those prices are

03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479
specifically how those prices are

03:28:18.479 --> 03:28:21.349
specifically how those prices are calculated and the final one brought to

03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359
calculated and the final one brought to

03:28:21.359 --> 03:28:25.349
calculated and the final one brought to the end user.

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:26.950
So I thought that it will be already

03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:26.960
So I thought that it will be already

03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:29.269
So I thought that it will be already available for this training but uh sorry

03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279
available for this training but uh sorry

03:28:29.279 --> 03:28:31.510
available for this training but uh sorry it is not like need to wait a couple of

03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520
it is not like need to wait a couple of

03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:35.030
it is not like need to wait a couple of days so then I would demonstrate it.

03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040
days so then I would demonstrate it.

03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:38.790
days so then I would demonstrate it. Okay. So uh we might have like a complex

03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800
Okay. So uh we might have like a complex

03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:42.870
Okay. So uh we might have like a complex setup um different uh price lists uh on

03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880
setup um different uh price lists uh on

03:28:42.880 --> 03:28:45.670
setup um different uh price lists uh on different levels with the fallbacks uh

03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680
different levels with the fallbacks uh

03:28:45.680 --> 03:28:48.550
different levels with the fallbacks uh and so on. On the other hand side in

03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560
and so on. On the other hand side in

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:50.630
and so on. On the other hand side in some cases

03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640
some cases

03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:53.830
some cases clients that are using autoo auto or

03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840
clients that are using autoo auto or

03:28:53.840 --> 03:28:55.990
clients that are using autoo auto or commerce they do not have such complex

03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000
commerce they do not have such complex

03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:00.870
commerce they do not have such complex uh prices for instance they using u some

03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880
uh prices for instance they using u some

03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:03.670
uh prices for instance they using u some prices from the external system some ERP

03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680
prices from the external system some ERP

03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:07.349
prices from the external system some ERP system let's say and u this is like u

03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359
system let's say and u this is like u

03:29:07.359 --> 03:29:10.630
system let's say and u this is like u this could be presented as a plain uh

03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640
this could be presented as a plain uh

03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:14.229
this could be presented as a plain uh database records u so with that we can

03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239
database records u so with that we can

03:29:14.239 --> 03:29:17.030
database records u so with that we can enable this so-called flat pricing

03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040
enable this so-called flat pricing

03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:19.750
enable this so-called flat pricing But uh the limitation is we should have

03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760
But uh the limitation is we should have

03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:23.990
But uh the limitation is we should have u only one single uh price list assigned

03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000
u only one single uh price list assigned

03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:27.269
u only one single uh price list assigned to the uh uh to the website customer

03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279
to the uh uh to the website customer

03:29:27.279 --> 03:29:30.550
to the uh uh to the website customer customer group level and

03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560
customer group level and

03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:32.790
customer group level and computations that I was just mentioning

03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800
computations that I was just mentioning

03:29:32.800 --> 03:29:35.590
computations that I was just mentioning about this uh combined price list they

03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600
about this uh combined price list they

03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:38.950
about this uh combined price list they will not uh take place. Uh so simply the

03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960
will not uh take place. Uh so simply the

03:29:38.960 --> 03:29:41.670
will not uh take place. Uh so simply the prices will be uh provided from the from

03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680
prices will be uh provided from the from

03:29:41.680 --> 03:29:44.229
prices will be uh provided from the from that u from the prices list which is

03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239
that u from the prices list which is

03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:46.469
that u from the prices list which is assigned on on one of the levels which

03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479
assigned on on one of the levels which

03:29:46.479 --> 03:29:49.269
assigned on on one of the levels which are listed here. Uh so they are fetched

03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279
are listed here. Uh so they are fetched

03:29:49.279 --> 03:29:51.910
are listed here. Uh so they are fetched directly without any computation and

03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920
directly without any computation and

03:29:51.920 --> 03:29:54.469
directly without any computation and this is actual for the small scale

03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479
this is actual for the small scale

03:29:54.479 --> 03:29:57.510
this is actual for the small scale businesses uh especially yeah when the

03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520
businesses uh especially yeah when the

03:29:57.520 --> 03:29:59.190
businesses uh especially yeah when the prices are managed in a third party

03:29:59.190 --> 03:29:59.200
prices are managed in a third party

03:29:59.200 --> 03:30:01.030
prices are managed in a third party system for instance and they are just

03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040
system for instance and they are just

03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:04.550
system for instance and they are just provided via API or some other uh

03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560
provided via API or some other uh

03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:08.550
provided via API or some other uh connector to the uh orcommerce and you

03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560
connector to the uh orcommerce and you

03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:11.429
connector to the uh orcommerce and you have just simply

03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439
have just simply

03:30:11.439 --> 03:30:16.309
have just simply one price list let's say u and no um uh

03:30:16.309 --> 03:30:16.319
one price list let's say u and no um uh

03:30:16.319 --> 03:30:20.150
one price list let's say u and no um uh no strategies no stuff for for merging

03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160
no strategies no stuff for for merging

03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:23.590
no strategies no stuff for for merging them from different levels. Uh in order

03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:23.600
them from different levels. Uh in order

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:25.510
them from different levels. Uh in order to

03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520
to

03:30:25.520 --> 03:30:29.110
to switch between uh different between this

03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120
switch between uh different between this

03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:32.150
switch between uh different between this so-called complex uh pricing which we

03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160
so-called complex uh pricing which we

03:30:32.160 --> 03:30:35.990
so-called complex uh pricing which we were describing here in the first uh

03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000
were describing here in the first uh

03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:37.750
were describing here in the first uh section

03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760
section

03:30:37.760 --> 03:30:40.790
section and flat uh pricing. So we have a

03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800
and flat uh pricing. So we have a

03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:43.190
and flat uh pricing. So we have a console command for that and you would

03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200
console command for that and you would

03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:46.229
console command for that and you would need to run it. Uh so this one switch

03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239
need to run it. Uh so this one switch

03:30:46.239 --> 03:30:48.150
need to run it. Uh so this one switch price and storage and we specify what

03:30:48.150 --> 03:30:48.160
price and storage and we specify what

03:30:48.160 --> 03:30:50.630
price and storage and we specify what kind of storage it should be either flat

03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640
kind of storage it should be either flat

03:30:50.640 --> 03:30:54.630
kind of storage it should be either flat or uh combined

03:30:54.630 --> 03:30:54.640
or uh combined

03:30:54.640 --> 03:30:58.630
or uh combined and uh yeah and under the hood the the

03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640
and uh yeah and under the hood the the

03:30:58.640 --> 03:31:02.389
and uh yeah and under the hood the the the change the settings will be uh will

03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399
the change the settings will be uh will

03:31:02.399 --> 03:31:04.710
the change the settings will be uh will be applied. So these settings actually

03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720
be applied. So these settings actually

03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:07.429
be applied. So these settings actually will will be stored and from that you

03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439
will will be stored and from that you

03:31:07.439 --> 03:31:10.229
will will be stored and from that you will use like flat

03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239
will use like flat

03:31:10.239 --> 03:31:15.269
will use like flat flat prices but not combined one.

03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279
flat prices but not combined one.

03:31:15.279 --> 03:31:17.830
flat prices but not combined one. Actually if the change is uh done then

03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840
Actually if the change is uh done then

03:31:17.840 --> 03:31:19.990
Actually if the change is uh done then you would need to recalculate not

03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000
you would need to recalculate not

03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:23.269
you would need to recalculate not recalculate reindex products to reflect

03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279
recalculate reindex products to reflect

03:31:23.279 --> 03:31:26.790
recalculate reindex products to reflect uh these prices uh in the uh in the

03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800
uh these prices uh in the uh in the

03:31:26.800 --> 03:31:30.710
uh these prices uh in the uh in the storefront.

03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:39.990
So for the prices to be in index.

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:43.110
Okay. And a couple of uh finalizing this

03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120
Okay. And a couple of uh finalizing this

03:31:43.120 --> 03:31:47.429
Okay. And a couple of uh finalizing this uh topic a couple of u uh hints uh

03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439
uh topic a couple of u uh hints uh

03:31:47.439 --> 03:31:50.469
uh topic a couple of u uh hints uh related to best practices. So

03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479
related to best practices. So

03:31:50.479 --> 03:31:55.269
related to best practices. So uh if you have like a price list uh try

03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279
uh if you have like a price list uh try

03:31:55.279 --> 03:31:58.229
uh if you have like a price list uh try to use uh a fallbacks u fallback

03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239
to use uh a fallbacks u fallback

03:31:58.239 --> 03:32:03.030
to use uh a fallbacks u fallback mechanism and uh just not to copy uh

03:32:03.030 --> 03:32:03.040
mechanism and uh just not to copy uh

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:06.309
mechanism and uh just not to copy uh prices across different price list just

03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319
prices across different price list just

03:32:06.319 --> 03:32:09.830
prices across different price list just uh specify it in one place use fallback

03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840
uh specify it in one place use fallback

03:32:09.840 --> 03:32:13.349
uh specify it in one place use fallback and only override uh uh override uh

03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359
and only override uh uh override uh

03:32:13.359 --> 03:32:16.309
and only override uh uh override uh prices on the next level uh using this

03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319
prices on the next level uh using this

03:32:16.319 --> 03:32:20.710
prices on the next level uh using this fallback uh um phobic

03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720
fallback uh um phobic

03:32:20.720 --> 03:32:22.630
fallback uh um phobic logic.

03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640
logic.

03:32:22.640 --> 03:32:25.590
logic. Uh it is not recommended to create uh

03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600
Uh it is not recommended to create uh

03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:28.389
Uh it is not recommended to create uh separate price list uh for one uh single

03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399
separate price list uh for one uh single

03:32:28.399 --> 03:32:31.670
separate price list uh for one uh single product. Uh uh just use uh like uh

03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680
product. Uh uh just use uh like uh

03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:34.229
product. Uh uh just use uh like uh combine all all products uh like

03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239
combine all all products uh like

03:32:34.239 --> 03:32:38.550
combine all all products uh like together uh and just prepare a

03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560
together uh and just prepare a

03:32:38.560 --> 03:32:41.030
together uh and just prepare a price list for for a set of products. So

03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040
price list for for a set of products. So

03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:43.910
price list for for a set of products. So the example I was just demonstrated is

03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920
the example I was just demonstrated is

03:32:43.920 --> 03:32:47.510
the example I was just demonstrated is uh when I created uh a price list for

03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520
uh when I created uh a price list for

03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:49.590
uh when I created uh a price list for for a single product. This is a bad

03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600
for a single product. This is a bad

03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:52.070
for a single product. This is a bad example. So do not do it. Just use a

03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080
example. So do not do it. Just use a

03:32:52.080 --> 03:32:55.830
example. So do not do it. Just use a price list for a set of uh

03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840
price list for a set of uh

03:32:55.840 --> 03:32:59.349
price list for a set of uh prices for per set of products

03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359
prices for per set of products

03:32:59.359 --> 03:33:02.630
prices for per set of products and uh try to minimize number of price

03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640
and uh try to minimize number of price

03:33:02.640 --> 03:33:04.630
and uh try to minimize number of price lists you have in a system. So think

03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640
lists you have in a system. So think

03:33:04.640 --> 03:33:08.710
lists you have in a system. So think ahead uh uh whether you how many prices

03:33:08.710 --> 03:33:08.720
ahead uh uh whether you how many prices

03:33:08.720 --> 03:33:11.349
ahead uh uh whether you how many prices you should have in a system uh how they

03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359
you should have in a system uh how they

03:33:11.359 --> 03:33:15.269
you should have in a system uh how they should be uh set up those fallbacks and

03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279
should be uh set up those fallbacks and

03:33:15.279 --> 03:33:18.550
should be uh set up those fallbacks and especially uh the the strategy to use

03:33:18.550 --> 03:33:18.560
especially uh the the strategy to use

03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:22.950
especially uh the the strategy to use either minimal or merge by priority

03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960
either minimal or merge by priority

03:33:22.960 --> 03:33:24.710
either minimal or merge by priority and choose this yeah strategy at the

03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720
and choose this yeah strategy at the

03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:26.630
and choose this yeah strategy at the very beginning because if you do the

03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640
very beginning because if you do the

03:33:26.640 --> 03:33:28.630
very beginning because if you do the change when you are already running the

03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640
change when you are already running the

03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:32.309
change when you are already running the business it will take for you uh some

03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319
business it will take for you uh some

03:33:32.319 --> 03:33:35.269
business it will take for you uh some time to do this reset plus uh do

03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279
time to do this reset plus uh do

03:33:35.279 --> 03:33:36.790
time to do this reset plus uh do recalculation

03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800
recalculation

03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:40.870
recalculation uh to have uh combined prices plus uh

03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880
uh to have uh combined prices plus uh

03:33:40.880 --> 03:33:44.790
uh to have uh combined prices plus uh reindex products to have prices uh uh on

03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800
reindex products to have prices uh uh on

03:33:44.800 --> 03:33:48.710
reindex products to have prices uh uh on the storefront actual

03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720
the storefront actual

03:33:48.720 --> 03:33:52.389
the storefront actual and we have uh some concepts uh listed

03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399
and we have uh some concepts uh listed

03:33:52.399 --> 03:33:54.150
and we have uh some concepts uh listed documentation.

03:33:54.150 --> 03:33:54.160
documentation.

03:33:54.160 --> 03:33:56.790
documentation. Let me check whether I have missed

03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800
Let me check whether I have missed

03:33:56.800 --> 03:33:59.510
Let me check whether I have missed something

03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520
something

03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:05.670
something uh or not.

03:34:05.680 --> 03:34:07.910
Yeah, most of the things we have already

03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920
Yeah, most of the things we have already

03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:13.750
Yeah, most of the things we have already went through.

03:34:13.760 --> 03:34:16.950
Yeah, it simply also explains uh those

03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:16.960
Yeah, it simply also explains uh those

03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:19.750
Yeah, it simply also explains uh those parts we went through uh how the

03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760
parts we went through uh how the

03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:23.190
parts we went through uh how the strategies works with real examples uh

03:34:23.190 --> 03:34:23.200
strategies works with real examples uh

03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:26.229
strategies works with real examples uh depending on setup u uh prices on

03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239
depending on setup u uh prices on

03:34:26.239 --> 03:34:30.229
depending on setup u uh prices on different levels.

03:34:30.239 --> 03:34:35.030
Okay. So now let's switch to the Q&amp;A se

03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040
Okay. So now let's switch to the Q&amp;A se

03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:42.389
Okay. So now let's switch to the Q&amp;A se uh section.

03:34:42.399 --> 03:34:44.150
So the first question curious what

03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160
So the first question curious what

03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:46.229
So the first question curious what happens if there is no uh there is no

03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239
happens if there is no uh there is no

03:34:46.239 --> 03:34:49.590
happens if there is no uh there is no price reset no fallbacks will there

03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:49.600
price reset no fallbacks will there

03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:52.469
price reset no fallbacks will there simply not be price on the front end yes

03:34:52.469 --> 03:34:52.479
simply not be price on the front end yes

03:34:52.479 --> 03:34:54.710
simply not be price on the front end yes that's true you will have no priceless

03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720
that's true you will have no priceless

03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:57.030
that's true you will have no priceless at the on the front end and this is

03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040
at the on the front end and this is

03:34:57.040 --> 03:34:58.950
at the on the front end and this is something we were I was demonstrated

03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960
something we were I was demonstrated

03:34:58.960 --> 03:35:06.150
something we were I was demonstrated when I just uh made a fallback uh here

03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160
when I just uh made a fallback uh here

03:35:06.160 --> 03:35:09.110
when I just uh made a fallback uh here um specify the fallback to stop on a

03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120
um specify the fallback to stop on a

03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:11.110
um specify the fallback to stop on a current customer group. So we didn't

03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120
current customer group. So we didn't

03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:13.990
current customer group. So we didn't have any prices for all the products

03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000
have any prices for all the products

03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.150
have any prices for all the products except the one which was listed in this

03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160
except the one which was listed in this

03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:17.990
except the one which was listed in this price list.

03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000
price list.

03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:21.830
price list. Can we hide price for guests? Uh you can

03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840
Can we hide price for guests? Uh you can

03:35:21.840 --> 03:35:26.469
Can we hide price for guests? Uh you can hide price for guests by uh

03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479
hide price for guests by uh

03:35:26.479 --> 03:35:29.190
hide price for guests by uh uh but that will be not kind of hiding

03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200
uh but that will be not kind of hiding

03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:33.030
uh but that will be not kind of hiding prices for guests but rather

03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040
prices for guests but rather

03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:36.389
prices for guests but rather u not having prices for guests at all.

03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399
u not having prices for guests at all.

03:35:36.399 --> 03:35:39.349
u not having prices for guests at all. Right? Uh for that we can use uh

03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359
Right? Uh for that we can use uh

03:35:39.359 --> 03:35:43.190
Right? Uh for that we can use uh customer group uh

03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200
customer group uh

03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:47.110
customer group uh nonificated visitors right we can go and

03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120
nonificated visitors right we can go and

03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:51.030
nonificated visitors right we can go and add it and specify that we would like to

03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040
add it and specify that we would like to

03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:55.590
add it and specify that we would like to use a price list uh not from the website

03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600
use a price list uh not from the website

03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:59.030
use a price list uh not from the website uh as a fallback but on the cast current

03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040
uh as a fallback but on the cast current

03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:01.190
uh as a fallback but on the cast current customer group only. And here we have no

03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200
customer group only. And here we have no

03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:05.910
customer group only. And here we have no prices. Okay. Save the changes.

03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:05.920
prices. Okay. Save the changes.

03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:13.510
prices. Okay. Save the changes. Uh and now let me check is okay.

03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:17.590
Now if I go to the let's check here all

03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600
Now if I go to the let's check here all

03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:20.630
Now if I go to the let's check here all is fine. If I log out

03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640
is fine. If I log out

03:36:20.640 --> 03:36:23.269
is fine. If I log out search for the products price not

03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279
search for the products price not

03:36:23.279 --> 03:36:26.309
search for the products price not available price not available. So that's

03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319
available price not available. So that's

03:36:26.319 --> 03:36:32.229
available price not available. So that's how we can uh restrict or we can have no

03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239
how we can uh restrict or we can have no

03:36:32.239 --> 03:36:35.590
how we can uh restrict or we can have no prices for the guest users.

03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600
prices for the guest users.

03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:37.830
prices for the guest users. uh

03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840
uh

03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:41.030
uh the option to hide maybe this one price

03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040
the option to hide maybe this one price

03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:44.950
the option to hide maybe this one price not available. Uh I don't think we have

03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960
not available. Uh I don't think we have

03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:48.070
not available. Uh I don't think we have this option to for the guest users.

03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080
this option to for the guest users.

03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.630
this option to for the guest users. Let's check guest

03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640
Let's check guest

03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:53.750
Let's check guest uh guests.

03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760
uh guests.

03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:55.750
uh guests. So I am thinking whether we have a

03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760
So I am thinking whether we have a

03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:58.070
So I am thinking whether we have a configuration option just simply not to

03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080
configuration option just simply not to

03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:00.229
configuration option just simply not to to display

03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239
to display

03:37:00.239 --> 03:37:04.309
to display uh so we don't have so that would be a

03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319
uh so we don't have so that would be a

03:37:04.319 --> 03:37:06.710
uh so we don't have so that would be a customization to hide this uh price not

03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720
customization to hide this uh price not

03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:10.469
customization to hide this uh price not available for the guest users

03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479
available for the guest users

03:37:10.479 --> 03:37:12.790
available for the guest users uh do we have any option for importing

03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800
uh do we have any option for importing

03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:16.150
uh do we have any option for importing price list via API?

03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160
price list via API?

03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:19.190
price list via API? Uh so while talking about price list I

03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200
Uh so while talking about price list I

03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:22.710
Uh so while talking about price list I mentioned that we have this option

03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720
mentioned that we have this option

03:37:22.720 --> 03:37:25.990
mentioned that we have this option uh okay to import

03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000
uh okay to import

03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.070
uh okay to import oops uh so we have a price list to

03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080
oops uh so we have a price list to

03:37:30.080 --> 03:37:32.630
oops uh so we have a price list to import using import file right we

03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640
import using import file right we

03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:35.750
import using import file right we specify the source and import them uh

03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760
specify the source and import them uh

03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:40.550
specify the source and import them uh from the API standpoint uh duplicate

03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560
from the API standpoint uh duplicate

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:43.590
from the API standpoint uh duplicate we have this admin

03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600
we have this admin

03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:45.429
we have this admin API

03:37:45.429 --> 03:37:45.439
API

03:37:45.439 --> 03:37:50.950
API document mentation

03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:54.710
take.

03:37:54.720 --> 03:37:57.830
So we have an API endpoints which will

03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840
So we have an API endpoints which will

03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:00.150
So we have an API endpoints which will allow us first of all to create a price

03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160
allow us first of all to create a price

03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:04.150
allow us first of all to create a price list. Um here we have like a post u to

03:38:04.150 --> 03:38:04.160
list. Um here we have like a post u to

03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:06.469
list. Um here we have like a post u to update the price list some patch uh

03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479
update the price list some patch uh

03:38:06.479 --> 03:38:09.510
update the price list some patch uh actions. We also have um the ability to

03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520
actions. We also have um the ability to

03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:11.590
actions. We also have um the ability to specify schedules for the price list

03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600
specify schedules for the price list

03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:13.670
specify schedules for the price list also endpoints

03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680
also endpoints

03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:16.150
also endpoints uh to assign price list to the customer

03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160
uh to assign price list to the customer

03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:22.070
uh to assign price list to the customer groups um and product prices also we can

03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080
groups um and product prices also we can

03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:25.110
groups um and product prices also we can specify we can assign product prices to

03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120
specify we can assign product prices to

03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:26.870
specify we can assign product prices to the prices. to answer any questions. We

03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880
the prices. to answer any questions. We

03:38:26.880 --> 03:38:31.590
the prices. to answer any questions. We do have API endpoints uh for that. Uh

03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600
do have API endpoints uh for that. Uh

03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:35.910
do have API endpoints uh for that. Uh what uh I have faced with is uh reusing

03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920
what uh I have faced with is uh reusing

03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:40.070
what uh I have faced with is uh reusing uh this um import logic

03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080
uh this um import logic

03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:44.870
uh this um import logic to uh uh to import prices uh like

03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880
to uh uh to import prices uh like

03:38:44.880 --> 03:38:49.830
to uh uh to import prices uh like automatically using some um

03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840
automatically using some um

03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:52.469
automatically using some um so instead of importing via API like one

03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479
so instead of importing via API like one

03:38:52.479 --> 03:38:56.070
so instead of importing via API like one by one or in batches but simply reusing

03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080
by one or in batches but simply reusing

03:38:56.080 --> 03:38:58.229
by one or in batches but simply reusing this u

03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239
this u

03:38:58.239 --> 03:39:01.030
this u this functionality. So you are providing

03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040
this functionality. So you are providing

03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:03.110
this functionality. So you are providing a

03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120
a

03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:07.269
a uh introducing additional uh scheduled

03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279
uh introducing additional uh scheduled

03:39:07.279 --> 03:39:11.349
uh introducing additional uh scheduled task uh here schedule task within that

03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359
task uh here schedule task within that

03:39:11.359 --> 03:39:13.510
task uh here schedule task within that schedule task you are reusing uh this

03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520
schedule task you are reusing uh this

03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:16.469
schedule task you are reusing uh this import job and you are just specifying

03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479
import job and you are just specifying

03:39:16.479 --> 03:39:19.349
import job and you are just specifying from what resource to take the CSV file

03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359
from what resource to take the CSV file

03:39:19.359 --> 03:39:23.750
from what resource to take the CSV file and as a resource uh some FTP uh FTP uh

03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760
and as a resource uh some FTP uh FTP uh

03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:26.469
and as a resource uh some FTP uh FTP uh server folder was used for that purpose

03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479
server folder was used for that purpose

03:39:26.479 --> 03:39:28.950
server folder was used for that purpose and with that on a daily basis prices

03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960
and with that on a daily basis prices

03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:32.550
and with that on a daily basis prices were lowered and it was like much more

03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560
were lowered and it was like much more

03:39:32.560 --> 03:39:35.110
were lowered and it was like much more from performance standpoint more

03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120
from performance standpoint more

03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:36.790
from performance standpoint more convenient for the for the server to

03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800
convenient for the for the server to

03:39:36.800 --> 03:39:39.349
convenient for the for the server to handle those uh prices. Not just hitting

03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359
handle those uh prices. Not just hitting

03:39:39.359 --> 03:39:43.030
handle those uh prices. Not just hitting the end points uh this one we have uh

03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040
the end points uh this one we have uh

03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:45.750
the end points uh this one we have uh but simply taking one uh file and

03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760
but simply taking one uh file and

03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:52.229
but simply taking one uh file and processing it.

03:39:52.239 --> 03:39:54.070
I assume a product without a price

03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080
I assume a product without a price

03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:56.950
I assume a product without a price cannot be added to cart and order it.

03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960
cannot be added to cart and order it.

03:39:56.960 --> 03:40:01.750
cannot be added to cart and order it. Yes. Mhm. So if you have uh uh if you

03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760
Yes. Mhm. So if you have uh uh if you

03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:04.309
Yes. Mhm. So if you have uh uh if you sign in

03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319
sign in

03:40:04.319 --> 03:40:06.469
sign in actually you would be able to add it to

03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479
actually you would be able to add it to

03:40:06.479 --> 03:40:09.910
actually you would be able to add it to the uh shopping uh list. Uh product

03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920
the uh shopping uh list. Uh product

03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:11.750
the uh shopping uh list. Uh product could be added to the shopping list

03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760
could be added to the shopping list

03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:15.110
could be added to the shopping list without price but ordering it will not

03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120
without price but ordering it will not

03:40:15.120 --> 03:40:18.469
without price but ordering it will not be allowed.

03:40:18.479 --> 03:40:20.389
Uh so going through the checkout in the

03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399
Uh so going through the checkout in the

03:40:20.399 --> 03:40:22.710
Uh so going through the checkout in the checkout it will be removed.

03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720
checkout it will be removed.

03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:26.309
checkout it will be removed. uh product without uh price

03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319
uh product without uh price

03:40:26.319 --> 03:40:29.349
uh product without uh price uh is there back orders? Can the price

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359
uh is there back orders? Can the price

03:40:29.359 --> 03:40:33.590
uh is there back orders? Can the price uh be changed in that case? Uh so there

03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600
uh be changed in that case? Uh so there

03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:37.590
uh be changed in that case? Uh so there is uh uh back orders functionality

03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600
is uh uh back orders functionality

03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:40.870
is uh uh back orders functionality uh we will cover it in the inventory

03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880
uh we will cover it in the inventory

03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:43.830
uh we will cover it in the inventory uh topics. Uh this is related to

03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840
uh topics. Uh this is related to

03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:47.830
uh topics. Uh this is related to inventory and u can the price be changed

03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840
inventory and u can the price be changed

03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:53.030
inventory and u can the price be changed in that case. Uh so you mean that uh we

03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040
in that case. Uh so you mean that uh we

03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:56.229
in that case. Uh so you mean that uh we have no

03:40:56.229 --> 03:40:56.239
have no

03:40:56.239 --> 03:40:59.110
have no uh products available in a warehouse and

03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120
uh products available in a warehouse and

03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:03.269
uh products available in a warehouse and depending on it the price is changed. Am

03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279
depending on it the price is changed. Am

03:41:03.279 --> 03:41:04.950
depending on it the price is changed. Am I correct

03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960
I correct

03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:07.110
I correct the price should be changed to some

03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120
the price should be changed to some

03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:10.630
the price should be changed to some maybe higher

03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:14.150
Victor?

Can you clarify? Yes. Sorry. Uh

03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:22.469
uh what my question was is about the

03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:22.479
uh what my question was is about the

03:41:22.479 --> 03:41:23.750
uh what my question was is about the beorders.

03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760
beorders.

03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:24.710
beorders. Mhm.

03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720
Mhm.

03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:28.389
Mhm. So I I'm asking if if there is beorders

03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399
So I I'm asking if if there is beorders

03:41:28.399 --> 03:41:30.550
So I I'm asking if if there is beorders and if there is beorders so probably

03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560
and if there is beorders so probably

03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:32.469
and if there is beorders so probably price could be changed later. So when

03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479
price could be changed later. So when

03:41:32.479 --> 03:41:34.630
price could be changed later. So when the beorder is available the price can

03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640
the beorder is available the price can

03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:38.229
the beorder is available the price can be changed at higher uh price. So in

03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239
be changed at higher uh price. So in

03:41:38.239 --> 03:41:40.950
be changed at higher uh price. So in this case it can be changed somehow.

03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960
this case it can be changed somehow.

03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:42.710
this case it can be changed somehow. However it's related to the order

03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720
However it's related to the order

03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:43.910
However it's related to the order probably.

03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920
probably.

03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:47.110
probably. Yes, that's I will demonstrate what we

03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120
Yes, that's I will demonstrate what we

03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:49.349
Yes, that's I will demonstrate what we have for the back orders in the

03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359
have for the back orders in the

03:41:49.359 --> 03:41:53.110
have for the back orders in the inventory topic. But uh this part that

03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120
inventory topic. But uh this part that

03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:56.950
inventory topic. But uh this part that you were just describing related to the

03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960
you were just describing related to the

03:41:56.960 --> 03:41:58.070
you were just describing related to the prices.

03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080
prices.

03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:00.630
prices. My my question then for the second part

03:42:00.630 --> 03:42:00.640
My my question then for the second part

03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:03.990
My my question then for the second part is like uh can we change the price in

03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000
is like uh can we change the price in

03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:07.269
is like uh can we change the price in the order if it's needed by the uh

03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279
the order if it's needed by the uh

03:42:07.279 --> 03:42:08.710
the order if it's needed by the uh in the order?

03:42:08.710 --> 03:42:08.720
in the order?

03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:11.750
in the order? Mhm. Okay. In the order. Yes. The price.

03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760
Mhm. Okay. In the order. Yes. The price.

03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:14.950
Mhm. Okay. In the order. Yes. The price. So whenever we have an order we can uh

03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960
So whenever we have an order we can uh

03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:19.349
So whenever we have an order we can uh go to um orders.

03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359
go to um orders.

03:42:19.359 --> 03:42:22.550
go to um orders. Um so these are the all orders which are

03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560
Um so these are the all orders which are

03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:24.469
Um so these are the all orders which are still open

03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479
still open

03:42:24.479 --> 03:42:28.630
still open and navigateing to the edit

03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640
and navigateing to the edit

03:42:28.640 --> 03:42:30.469
and navigateing to the edit we are able to change the price to

03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479
we are able to change the price to

03:42:30.479 --> 03:42:34.309
we are able to change the price to override with some uh uh with the one

03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319
override with some uh uh with the one

03:42:34.319 --> 03:42:37.590
override with some uh uh with the one that you would like to to set for this

03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600
that you would like to to set for this

03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:39.190
that you would like to to set for this for this order.

03:42:39.190 --> 03:42:39.200
for this order.

03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:43.429
for this order. Okay, that work. Thank you. Mhm.

03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439
Okay, that work. Thank you. Mhm.

03:42:43.439 --> 03:42:48.070
Okay, that work. Thank you. Mhm. Uh the next question uh uh do we have an

03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080
Uh the next question uh uh do we have an

03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:51.670
Uh the next question uh uh do we have an option uh for turn on catalog mode front

03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680
option uh for turn on catalog mode front

03:42:51.680 --> 03:42:55.670
option uh for turn on catalog mode front end uh covers a catalog view only means

03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680
end uh covers a catalog view only means

03:42:55.680 --> 03:43:02.229
end uh covers a catalog view only means no price no add to cart no check out. Uh

03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:06.309
okay we are turning on catalog mode.

03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319
okay we are turning on catalog mode.

03:43:06.319 --> 03:43:08.870
okay we are turning on catalog mode. Uh and so we should have just simply a

03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880
Uh and so we should have just simply a

03:43:08.880 --> 03:43:11.750
Uh and so we should have just simply a catalog. No price, no add toart, no

03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760
catalog. No price, no add toart, no

03:43:11.760 --> 03:43:13.750
catalog. No price, no add toart, no check out.

03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760
check out.

03:43:13.760 --> 03:43:16.550
check out. Uh

03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560
Uh

03:43:16.560 --> 03:43:20.229
Uh I don't think we it could be organized

03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239
I don't think we it could be organized

03:43:20.239 --> 03:43:22.150
I don't think we it could be organized to actually it could not be organized

03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160
to actually it could not be organized

03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:27.429
to actually it could not be organized via some simple uh changing some option.

03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439
via some simple uh changing some option.

03:43:27.439 --> 03:43:35.110
via some simple uh changing some option. Uh as I demonstrated here, we have uh

03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:38.469
we have this um

03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479
we have this um

03:43:38.479 --> 03:43:41.189
we have this um maybe for the for the guest users if uh

03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199
maybe for the for the guest users if uh

03:43:41.199 --> 03:43:43.110
maybe for the for the guest users if uh this is meant for the guest users. So

03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120
this is meant for the guest users. So

03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:49.349
this is meant for the guest users. So the guest users we can limit uh their uh

03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359
the guest users we can limit uh their uh

03:43:49.359 --> 03:43:51.670
the guest users we can limit uh their uh capabilities and do not allow to go to

03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680
capabilities and do not allow to go to

03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:54.870
capabilities and do not allow to go to the to do not allow to add uh product to

03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880
the to do not allow to add uh product to

03:43:54.880 --> 03:43:56.870
the to do not allow to add uh product to the shopping list to go through the

03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880
the shopping list to go through the

03:43:56.880 --> 03:43:59.189
the shopping list to go through the checkout. Uh but that will be applied

03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199
checkout. Uh but that will be applied

03:43:59.199 --> 03:44:02.389
checkout. Uh but that will be applied only for the guest users only. Uh like

03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399
only for the guest users only. Uh like

03:44:02.399 --> 03:44:05.110
only for the guest users only. Uh like here we have some sort of catalog right

03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120
here we have some sort of catalog right

03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:09.269
here we have some sort of catalog right uh here for the guest. Uh no ability to

03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279
uh here for the guest. Uh no ability to

03:44:09.279 --> 03:44:12.229
uh here for the guest. Uh no ability to add to cart. If you go to the view page,

03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239
add to cart. If you go to the view page,

03:44:12.239 --> 03:44:16.790
add to cart. If you go to the view page, uh it actually does not show anything.

03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800
uh it actually does not show anything.

03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:21.110
uh it actually does not show anything. Okay, this one shows u add to new. Ah,

03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120
Okay, this one shows u add to new. Ah,

03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:26.229
Okay, this one shows u add to new. Ah, just a second. I was one second. I will

03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239
just a second. I was one second. I will

03:44:26.239 --> 03:44:30.070
just a second. I was one second. I will uh log out. So, view details.

03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080
uh log out. So, view details.

03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:32.550
uh log out. So, view details. Okay, just demonstrating the details of

03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560
Okay, just demonstrating the details of

03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:34.550
Okay, just demonstrating the details of the product. That's no ability to add to

03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560
the product. That's no ability to add to

03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:37.269
the product. That's no ability to add to cart, but this could be uh achieved for

03:44:37.269 --> 03:44:37.279
cart, but this could be uh achieved for

03:44:37.279 --> 03:44:44.389
cart, but this could be uh achieved for the guest users. uh uh this limitations

03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399
the guest users. uh uh this limitations

03:44:44.399 --> 03:44:46.710
the guest users. uh uh this limitations uh probably could be reused if you would

03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:46.720
uh probably could be reused if you would

03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:49.349
uh probably could be reused if you would like to have for other types of users it

03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359
like to have for other types of users it

03:44:49.359 --> 03:44:51.429
like to have for other types of users it could be reused so these limitations

03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439
could be reused so these limitations

03:44:51.439 --> 03:44:56.389
could be reused so these limitations could be exposed to uh to to some maybe

03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399
could be exposed to uh to to some maybe

03:44:56.399 --> 03:44:57.910
could be exposed to uh to to some maybe customer

03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920
customer

03:44:57.920 --> 03:44:59.830
customer group

03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840
group

03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:04.950
group have I answered uh the question or not

03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:08.790
uh yes partially I think uh fine. But uh

03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800
uh yes partially I think uh fine. But uh

03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:12.229
uh yes partially I think uh fine. But uh we have couple of enterprise customers

03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239
we have couple of enterprise customers

03:45:12.239 --> 03:45:14.150
we have couple of enterprise customers which they they do not sell their

03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160
which they they do not sell their

03:45:14.160 --> 03:45:17.189
which they they do not sell their products online. They actually u direct

03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199
products online. They actually u direct

03:45:17.199 --> 03:45:21.030
products online. They actually u direct the traffic to their in in store uh in

03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040
the traffic to their in in store uh in

03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:25.670
the traffic to their in in store uh in person. So they just um uh show their

03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680
person. So they just um uh show their

03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:28.229
person. So they just um uh show their products for demonstration purpose with

03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239
products for demonstration purpose with

03:45:28.239 --> 03:45:32.550
products for demonstration purpose with all the details. So on th those case we

03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560
all the details. So on th those case we

03:45:32.560 --> 03:45:34.870
all the details. So on th those case we want to hide those information no

03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880
want to hide those information no

03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:39.590
want to hide those information no pricing and add toart check out just a

03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600
pricing and add toart check out just a

03:45:39.600 --> 03:45:41.590
pricing and add toart check out just a product details

03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600
product details

03:45:41.600 --> 03:45:44.229
product details uh with all the custom attributes. So

03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239
uh with all the custom attributes. So

03:45:44.239 --> 03:45:47.349
uh with all the custom attributes. So this is what we I was thinking if we

03:45:47.349 --> 03:45:47.359
this is what we I was thinking if we

03:45:47.359 --> 03:45:51.189
this is what we I was thinking if we have such options that would be great.

03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199
have such options that would be great.

03:45:51.199 --> 03:45:53.590
have such options that would be great. Yeah. So

03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600
Yeah. So

03:45:53.600 --> 03:45:56.710
Yeah. So it could be easily achieved. Uh so using

03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720
it could be easily achieved. Uh so using

03:45:56.720 --> 03:45:59.030
it could be easily achieved. Uh so using uh some management console we do not

03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040
uh some management console we do not

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:01.510
uh some management console we do not have such option uh just to easily turn

03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520
have such option uh just to easily turn

03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:05.590
have such option uh just to easily turn on but we can use uh layout updates uh

03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600
on but we can use uh layout updates uh

03:46:05.600 --> 03:46:07.750
on but we can use uh layout updates uh remember we were talking about them uh

03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760
remember we were talking about them uh

03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:10.550
remember we were talking about them uh yesterday and we can check what kind of

03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560
yesterday and we can check what kind of

03:46:10.560 --> 03:46:13.429
yesterday and we can check what kind of uh block is responsible for uh for

03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439
uh block is responsible for uh for

03:46:13.439 --> 03:46:16.150
uh block is responsible for uh for rendering this piece right with the u

03:46:16.150 --> 03:46:16.160
rendering this piece right with the u

03:46:16.160 --> 03:46:18.710
rendering this piece right with the u price uh not available with the price

03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720
price uh not available with the price

03:46:18.720 --> 03:46:21.269
price uh not available with the price section and with the add to cart this

03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279
section and with the add to cart this

03:46:21.279 --> 03:46:24.389
section and with the add to cart this part with the prices and add to certain

03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399
part with the prices and add to certain

03:46:24.399 --> 03:46:27.510
part with the prices and add to certain list and We can simply u include in a

03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520
list and We can simply u include in a

03:46:27.520 --> 03:46:30.150
list and We can simply u include in a layout update to remove this uh this

03:46:30.150 --> 03:46:30.160
layout update to remove this uh this

03:46:30.160 --> 03:46:33.189
layout update to remove this uh this block and that's it. And we can set uh

03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199
block and that's it. And we can set uh

03:46:33.199 --> 03:46:35.429
block and that's it. And we can set uh in what cases we should remove this

03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439
in what cases we should remove this

03:46:35.439 --> 03:46:39.830
in what cases we should remove this block or all the data grids uh

03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840
block or all the data grids uh

03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:43.590
block or all the data grids uh storefront data grids or just uh for uh

03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600
storefront data grids or just uh for uh

03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:47.349
storefront data grids or just uh for uh for a particular page uh whatever. So I

03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359
for a particular page uh whatever. So I

03:46:47.359 --> 03:46:50.790
for a particular page uh whatever. So I would go uh that approach. So you will

03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800
would go uh that approach. So you will

03:46:50.800 --> 03:46:53.269
would go uh that approach. So you will have like a full control what you are

03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279
have like a full control what you are

03:46:53.279 --> 03:46:57.189
have like a full control what you are removing and uh specifying in what

03:46:57.189 --> 03:46:57.199
removing and uh specifying in what

03:46:57.199 --> 03:46:59.349
removing and uh specifying in what conditions uh for what conditions to

03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359
conditions uh for what conditions to

03:46:59.359 --> 03:47:01.510
conditions uh for what conditions to remove that block.

03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520
remove that block.

03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:03.269
remove that block. Okay.

03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279
Okay.

03:47:03.279 --> 03:47:07.030
Okay. So for example if uh store owner is on

03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040
So for example if uh store owner is on

03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:09.590
So for example if uh store owner is on holiday or vacation or they do not want

03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600
holiday or vacation or they do not want

03:47:09.600 --> 03:47:12.070
holiday or vacation or they do not want to proceed or accept any orders but they

03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080
to proceed or accept any orders but they

03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:15.189
to proceed or accept any orders but they also do not want to put their side on

03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199
also do not want to put their side on

03:47:15.199 --> 03:47:18.469
also do not want to put their side on maintenance mode. just keep running

03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479
maintenance mode. just keep running

03:47:18.479 --> 03:47:21.189
maintenance mode. just keep running their store and just giving purpose. No,

03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199
their store and just giving purpose. No,

03:47:21.199 --> 03:47:23.590
their store and just giving purpose. No, do not accept the order. Is there such

03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600
do not accept the order. Is there such

03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:26.630
do not accept the order. Is there such options? We could vacation more or

03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640
options? We could vacation more or

03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:27.510
options? We could vacation more or something.

03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520
something.

03:47:27.520 --> 03:47:30.790
something. No, no, out of the box there is no such

03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800
No, no, out of the box there is no such

03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:33.110
No, no, out of the box there is no such uh capability.

03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120
uh capability.

03:47:33.120 --> 03:47:35.750
uh capability. Uh maybe we could check I could check in

03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760
Uh maybe we could check I could check in

03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:39.349
Uh maybe we could check I could check in the extensions but this is like not I

03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359
the extensions but this is like not I

03:47:39.359 --> 03:47:42.950
the extensions but this is like not I suppose not so widely used at least they

03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960
suppose not so widely used at least they

03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:49.670
suppose not so widely used at least they have it. Mhm. Got it. Okay.

03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:52.469
Okay. The next question, uh, does it

03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479
Okay. The next question, uh, does it

03:47:52.479 --> 03:47:54.870
Okay. The next question, uh, does it update the price of the product which is

03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880
update the price of the product which is

03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:58.229
update the price of the product which is already in the cart if it was updated?

03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239
already in the cart if it was updated?

03:47:58.239 --> 03:48:03.189
already in the cart if it was updated? Yes. Uh, in a cart. Yes. Mhm. It should

03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199
Yes. Uh, in a cart. Yes. Mhm. It should

03:48:03.199 --> 03:48:07.030
Yes. Uh, in a cart. Yes. Mhm. It should uh already uh update the product. Uh so

03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040
uh already uh update the product. Uh so

03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:09.990
uh already uh update the product. Uh so in a cart uh in a shopping list uh there

03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000
in a cart uh in a shopping list uh there

03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:14.070
in a cart uh in a shopping list uh there is uh uh if you have a product in a

03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080
is uh uh if you have a product in a

03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:18.070
is uh uh if you have a product in a shopping list uh the price will still uh

03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080
shopping list uh the price will still uh

03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:21.110
shopping list uh the price will still uh refer to the one which is taken from the

03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120
refer to the one which is taken from the

03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:23.429
refer to the one which is taken from the from the price list. If we start the

03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439
from the price list. If we start the

03:48:23.439 --> 03:48:25.990
from the price list. If we start the checkout uh if I'm not mistaken yeah in

03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000
checkout uh if I'm not mistaken yeah in

03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:28.150
checkout uh if I'm not mistaken yeah in a checkout it should already yeah check

03:48:28.150 --> 03:48:28.160
a checkout it should already yeah check

03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:32.229
a checkout it should already yeah check out stories have a a value for storing

03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239
out stories have a a value for storing

03:48:32.239 --> 03:48:35.510
out stories have a a value for storing uh a price price value. That's why

03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520
uh a price price value. That's why

03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:37.030
uh a price price value. That's why whenever you are starting a check out,

03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040
whenever you are starting a check out,

03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:39.429
whenever you are starting a check out, you're kind of freezing the price and

03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439
you're kind of freezing the price and

03:48:39.439 --> 03:48:41.110
you're kind of freezing the price and continuing a check out with that with

03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120
continuing a check out with that with

03:48:41.120 --> 03:48:44.550
continuing a check out with that with that price because check out line items

03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560
that price because check out line items

03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:55.830
that price because check out line items they uh has their value for the price.

03:48:55.840 --> 03:49:07.429
Okay.

03:49:07.439 --> 03:49:13.510
But we can easily verify it

03:49:13.520 --> 03:49:39.670
uh using back office setup. And uh

03:49:39.680 --> 03:49:41.429
Yeah, remember we were changing this

03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439
Yeah, remember we were changing this

03:49:41.439 --> 03:49:45.830
Yeah, remember we were changing this price and uh for this um uh product uh

03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840
price and uh for this um uh product uh

03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:49.030
price and uh for this um uh product uh ah sorry this is not it we were changing

03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040
ah sorry this is not it we were changing

03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:51.750
ah sorry this is not it we were changing for what? Yeah, for 94 uh this one for

03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760
for what? Yeah, for 94 uh this one for

03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:53.830
for what? Yeah, for 94 uh this one for this product. So we were changing the

03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840
this product. So we were changing the

03:49:53.840 --> 03:49:57.269
this product. So we were changing the product price uh like multiple times and

03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279
product price uh like multiple times and

03:49:57.279 --> 03:50:01.110
product price uh like multiple times and it reflects here the the final price uh

03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120
it reflects here the the final price uh

03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:03.990
it reflects here the the final price uh the last price we have. But if you go to

03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000
the last price we have. But if you go to

03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:08.150
the last price we have. But if you go to the checkout then it should be stored on

03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160
the checkout then it should be stored on

03:50:08.160 --> 03:50:10.630
the checkout then it should be stored on the

03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640
the

03:50:10.640 --> 03:50:20.309
the on the check out line item level.

03:50:20.319 --> 03:50:23.349
Okay that's it. uh with the questions to

03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359
Okay that's it. uh with the questions to

03:50:23.359 --> 03:50:25.990
Okay that's it. uh with the questions to what I see

03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000
what I see

03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:30.309
what I see uh before we go to the uh and have a

03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319
uh before we go to the uh and have a

03:50:30.319 --> 03:50:34.550
uh before we go to the uh and have a break. Let me check uh what we have for

03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560
break. Let me check uh what we have for

03:50:34.560 --> 03:50:37.510
break. Let me check uh what we have for the

03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520
the

03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:39.910
the exercises

03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920
exercises

03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:53.510
exercises which you recommend to go through.

03:50:53.520 --> 03:50:55.110
Okay.

03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120
Okay.

03:50:55.120 --> 03:50:57.030
Okay. Uh so

03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040
Uh so

03:50:57.040 --> 03:51:00.070
Uh so just be free I will

03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080
just be free I will

03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:01.590
just be free I will demonstrate what we have for the

03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600
demonstrate what we have for the

03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:04.469
demonstrate what we have for the products and master catalog. I have not

03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479
products and master catalog. I have not

03:51:04.479 --> 03:51:07.429
products and master catalog. I have not u provided an exercise. So this is the

03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439
u provided an exercise. So this is the

03:51:07.439 --> 03:51:11.510
u provided an exercise. So this is the one which uh we recommend to to pass. Uh

03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520
one which uh we recommend to to pass. Uh

03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:14.550
one which uh we recommend to to pass. Uh so just a simple case to using master

03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560
so just a simple case to using master

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.790
so just a simple case to using master catalog

03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800
catalog

03:51:16.800 --> 03:51:19.349
catalog for building a menu. This is something

03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359
for building a menu. This is something

03:51:19.359 --> 03:51:21.670
for building a menu. This is something I've already demonstrated, but you could

03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680
I've already demonstrated, but you could

03:51:21.680 --> 03:51:23.910
I've already demonstrated, but you could do it on your own. Introducing some

03:51:23.910 --> 03:51:23.920
do it on your own. Introducing some

03:51:23.920 --> 03:51:26.870
do it on your own. Introducing some additional category in a master catalog

03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880
additional category in a master catalog

03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:30.469
additional category in a master catalog and adding a product there, verifying is

03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479
and adding a product there, verifying is

03:51:30.479 --> 03:51:32.630
and adding a product there, verifying is it displayed in a storefront or not.

03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640
it displayed in a storefront or not.

03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:39.510
it displayed in a storefront or not. Pretty straightforward. Another uh

03:51:39.520 --> 03:51:43.269
another thing is

03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279
another thing is

03:51:43.279 --> 03:51:46.630
another thing is which we recommend is related to prices.

03:51:46.630 --> 03:51:46.640
which we recommend is related to prices.

03:51:46.640 --> 03:51:49.030
which we recommend is related to prices. with the prices I do understand that it

03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040
with the prices I do understand that it

03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:53.189
with the prices I do understand that it is more more complex uh thing and that's

03:51:53.189 --> 03:51:53.199
is more more complex uh thing and that's

03:51:53.199 --> 03:51:56.309
is more more complex uh thing and that's why it is called so practice uh

03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319
why it is called so practice uh

03:51:56.319 --> 03:51:59.030
why it is called so practice uh functional practice section session so

03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040
functional practice section session so

03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:02.389
functional practice section session so you would need to it's actually

03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399
you would need to it's actually

03:52:02.399 --> 03:52:05.030
you would need to it's actually pretty the same that uh I did you during

03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040
pretty the same that uh I did you during

03:52:05.040 --> 03:52:08.070
pretty the same that uh I did you during demonstration so with that would need to

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080
demonstration so with that would need to

03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:11.429
demonstration so with that would need to create some uh additional customer group

03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439
create some uh additional customer group

03:52:11.439 --> 03:52:14.790
create some uh additional customer group in my case it was test customer then uh

03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800
in my case it was test customer then uh

03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:17.910
in my case it was test customer then uh create some price list which is some

03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920
create some price list which is some

03:52:17.920 --> 03:52:20.550
create some price list which is some percentage within some percentage

03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560
percentage within some percentage

03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:22.950
percentage within some percentage discount. Assigning that price list,

03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960
discount. Assigning that price list,

03:52:22.960 --> 03:52:26.790
discount. Assigning that price list, checking how fallback works in a

03:52:26.790 --> 03:52:26.800
checking how fallback works in a

03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:29.030
checking how fallback works in a storefront while you have assigned this

03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040
storefront while you have assigned this

03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:32.790
storefront while you have assigned this price list and uh yeah and some optional

03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800
price list and uh yeah and some optional

03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:36.630
price list and uh yeah and some optional stuff like u creating a price list based

03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640
stuff like u creating a price list based

03:52:36.640 --> 03:52:39.269
stuff like u creating a price list based on different uh

03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279
on different uh

03:52:39.279 --> 03:52:43.030
on different uh uh different setup.

03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040
uh different setup.

03:52:43.040 --> 03:52:45.750
uh different setup. I will provide uh slides within the

this is something our uh partners were already doing or practicing with

04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:25.120

few types amount 10%. We will check it

04:01:50.239 --> 04:01:53.590
few types amount 10%. We will check it in a back office in a moment. And there

04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600
in a back office in a moment. And there

04:01:53.600 --> 04:01:55.590
in a back office in a moment. And there should be also a discount factory which

04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600
should be also a discount factory which

04:01:55.600 --> 04:01:59.750
should be also a discount factory which should know about uh those uh types uh

04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760

available in the back office. So right

04:02:06.080 --> 04:02:09.590
available in the back office. So right now we have four types I've just

04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600

factory. So this is something you would need to introduce

04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720
need to introduce

04:02:24.720 --> 04:02:27.910
need to introduce uh if you will be adding your own uh

how it works. So first of all it works

04:02:41.040 --> 04:02:45.030
how it works. So first of all it works uh depending on a uh on on a type uh

04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040
uh depending on a uh on on a type uh

04:02:45.040 --> 04:02:47.990
uh depending on a uh on on a type uh whether we u will be providing some

04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000
whether we u will be providing some

04:09:10.319 --> 04:09:14.550
the shopping list like we have 10 items per each uh uh item we have this uh 10

04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560
per each uh uh item we have this uh 10

04:09:14.560 --> 04:09:20.150
per each uh uh item we have this uh 10 US u discount. So if I add it and apply

04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160
US u discount. So if I add it and apply

04:09:20.160 --> 04:09:22.870
US u discount. So if I add it and apply discount not per each uh item but for

04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880
discount not per each uh item but for

04:09:22.880 --> 04:09:25.990
discount not per each uh item but for the line items total. So then no matter

04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000
the line items total. So then no matter

04:09:26.000 --> 04:09:29.830
the line items total. So then no matter what uh quantity I have uh added here I

04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840
what uh quantity I have uh added here I

04:09:29.840 --> 04:09:33.269
what uh quantity I have uh added here I will have only 10 uh US dollars. So this

04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279
will have only 10 uh US dollars. So this

04:09:33.279 --> 04:09:37.110
will have only 10 uh US dollars. So this is the difference of applying u the

04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120
is the difference of applying u the

04:09:37.120 --> 04:09:40.950
is the difference of applying u the settings.

04:09:40.960 --> 04:09:43.590
Uh let me switch back

04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600
Uh let me switch back

04:09:43.600 --> 04:09:46.790
Uh let me switch back to the slides. Check whether

04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800
to the slides. Check whether

04:09:46.800 --> 04:09:48.550
to the slides. Check whether Hey, sorry

04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560
Hey, sorry

04:09:48.560 --> 04:09:49.910

item and it is allowing me to create a

04:10:57.600 --> 04:11:00.469
item and it is allowing me to create a order is it allowed me even though is

04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479
order is it allowed me even though is

order is it allowed me even though is out of stock.

04:11:02.070 --> 04:11:02.080
out of stock.

04:11:02.080 --> 04:11:06.229
out of stock. Uh it depends. So uh there is a so if I

04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239
Uh it depends. So uh there is a so if I

04:11:06.239 --> 04:11:08.309
Uh it depends. So uh there is a so if I go and here create an order it will

04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319
go and here create an order it will

04:11:08.319 --> 04:11:13.349
go and here create an order it will allow uh but it uh depends on inventory

04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359
allow uh but it uh depends on inventory

04:11:13.359 --> 04:11:16.070
allow uh but it uh depends on inventory uh inventory configuration uh we have

04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080
uh inventory configuration uh we have

04:11:16.080 --> 04:11:17.990
uh inventory configuration uh we have for the category or for the product

04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000
for the category or for the product

04:11:18.000 --> 04:11:21.429
for the category or for the product either either to allow uh to put out of

04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439
either either to allow uh to put out of

04:11:21.439 --> 04:11:24.870
either either to allow uh to put out of stock item to the uh

04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880

to the order or not.

04:11:26.640 --> 04:11:29.189
to the order or not. So but this is managed. Yeah, but this

04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199
So but this is managed. Yeah, but this

04:11:29.199 --> 04:11:35.429
So but this is managed. Yeah, but this is managed via this uh uh inventory.

04:11:35.439 --> 04:11:36.870
Yeah, understood. Yeah, understood.

04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880
Yeah, understood. Yeah, understood.

04:11:36.880 --> 04:11:37.830
Yeah, understood. Yeah, understood. That's fine. Yeah.

04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840
That's fine. Yeah.

04:11:37.840 --> 04:11:38.870
That's fine. Yeah. Okay.

04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880
Okay.

04:11:38.880 --> 04:11:40.469
Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.

04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479
Sounds good. Thank you.

04:11:40.479 --> 04:11:41.830
Sounds good. Thank you. Yeah. And here we have checked that

04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840
Yeah. And here we have checked that

04:11:41.840 --> 04:11:44.150
Yeah. And here we have checked that whenever we go to the checkout, those

04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160
whenever we go to the checkout, those

04:11:44.160 --> 04:11:46.550
whenever we go to the checkout, those discounts they are also transferred to

04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560
discounts they are also transferred to

04:11:46.560 --> 04:11:49.670
discounts they are also transferred to the checkout and then uh to the order

04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680
the checkout and then uh to the order

04:11:49.680 --> 04:11:51.990
the checkout and then uh to the order itself.

04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000
itself.

04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:57.189
itself. Okay. So I was on a on this slide and uh

04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199
Okay. So I was on a on this slide and uh

04:11:57.199 --> 04:11:59.429
Okay. So I was on a on this slide and uh just for as an example you may refer to

04:11:59.429 --> 04:11:59.439
just for as an example you may refer to

04:11:59.439 --> 04:12:02.309
just for as an example you may refer to this uh order discount. So if you will

04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319
this uh order discount. So if you will

04:12:02.319 --> 04:12:04.630
this uh order discount. So if you will be introducing your own discount you may

04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640
be introducing your own discount you may

04:12:04.640 --> 04:12:07.189
be introducing your own discount you may refer to the examples we have to the

04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199
refer to the examples we have to the

04:12:07.199 --> 04:12:09.750
refer to the examples we have to the implementation we have for existing and

04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760
implementation we have for existing and

04:12:09.760 --> 04:12:11.830
implementation we have for existing and actually this is the one which was

04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840
actually this is the one which was

04:12:11.840 --> 04:12:14.389
actually this is the one which was responsible for the order discount. just

04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399
responsible for the order discount. just

04:12:14.399 --> 04:12:16.550
responsible for the order discount. just uh it should actually implement two

04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560
uh it should actually implement two

04:12:16.560 --> 04:12:19.910
uh it should actually implement two methods like uh uh how to calculate the

04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920
methods like uh uh how to calculate the

04:12:19.920 --> 04:12:24.070
methods like uh uh how to calculate the value uh for the

04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080
value uh for the

04:12:24.080 --> 04:12:25.910
value uh for the uh for the entity that was provided

04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920
uh for the entity that was provided

04:12:25.920 --> 04:12:29.510
uh for the entity that was provided which is shopping list and how that u uh

04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520
which is shopping list and how that u uh

04:12:29.520 --> 04:12:33.269
which is shopping list and how that u uh or maybe line item in in the case using

04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279
or maybe line item in in the case using

04:12:33.279 --> 04:12:35.990
or maybe line item in in the case using order line item uh discount. So it

04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000
order line item uh discount. So it

04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:38.469
order line item uh discount. So it simply calculates and decides whether to

04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479
simply calculates and decides whether to

04:12:38.479 --> 04:12:41.269
simply calculates and decides whether to apply this discount or not. So only two

04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279
apply this discount or not. So only two

04:12:41.279 --> 04:12:44.550
apply this discount or not. So only two methods and if we go to order line item

04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560
methods and if we go to order line item

04:12:44.560 --> 04:12:46.469
methods and if we go to order line item the the last one I was just

04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479
the the last one I was just

04:12:46.479 --> 04:12:49.670
the the last one I was just demonstrated. So we have uh this also

04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680
demonstrated. So we have uh this also

04:12:49.680 --> 04:12:54.309
demonstrated. So we have uh this also two types of fixed amount and percent um

04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319
two types of fixed amount and percent um

04:12:54.319 --> 04:12:57.189
two types of fixed amount and percent um type of order and item discount we

04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199
type of order and item discount we

04:12:57.199 --> 04:13:00.149
type of order and item discount we should specify the discount value. Uh

04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159
should specify the discount value. Uh

04:13:00.159 --> 04:13:04.389
should specify the discount value. Uh also uh what matters is to which uh

04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399
also uh what matters is to which uh

04:13:04.399 --> 04:13:07.189
also uh what matters is to which uh products to apply and remember we were

04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199
products to apply and remember we were

04:13:07.199 --> 04:13:09.189
products to apply and remember we were applying to all the products we have but

04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199
applying to all the products we have but

04:13:09.199 --> 04:13:12.229
applying to all the products we have but you can limit and for sure you will be

04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239
you can limit and for sure you will be

04:13:12.239 --> 04:13:15.510
you can limit and for sure you will be limiting. The most crucial part is not

04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520
limiting. The most crucial part is not

04:13:15.520 --> 04:13:18.950
limiting. The most crucial part is not to forget about unit of quantity. So it

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960
to forget about unit of quantity. So it

04:13:18.960 --> 04:13:22.309
to forget about unit of quantity. So it matters uh when a promotion is uh

04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319
matters uh when a promotion is uh

04:13:22.319 --> 04:13:24.950
matters uh when a promotion is uh matched or not. That's why we have this

04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960
matched or not. That's why we have this

04:13:24.960 --> 04:13:29.750
matched or not. That's why we have this set and it was uh applied only for

04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760
set and it was uh applied only for

04:13:29.760 --> 04:13:33.110
set and it was uh applied only for products with a set uh unit of measure.

04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120
products with a set uh unit of measure.

04:13:33.120 --> 04:13:36.309
products with a set uh unit of measure. And uh the last thing we have yeah we

04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319
And uh the last thing we have yeah we

04:13:36.319 --> 04:13:39.429
And uh the last thing we have yeah we have this maximum quantity uh applied. I

04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439
have this maximum quantity uh applied. I

04:13:39.439 --> 04:13:42.309
have this maximum quantity uh applied. I will demonstrate on some other example.

04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319
will demonstrate on some other example.

04:13:42.319 --> 04:13:45.750
will demonstrate on some other example. And for the line item discount another

04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760
And for the line item discount another

04:13:45.760 --> 04:13:47.990
And for the line item discount another similar

04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000
similar

04:13:48.000 --> 04:13:50.950
similar uh discount class is responsible for

04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960
uh discount class is responsible for

04:13:50.960 --> 04:13:53.510
uh discount class is responsible for that but it has some additional

04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520
that but it has some additional

04:13:53.520 --> 04:13:56.710
that but it has some additional configuration. And you may see that

04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720
configuration. And you may see that

04:13:56.720 --> 04:14:01.030
configuration. And you may see that calculation differs depending on uh on

04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040

it. So this is how you can manage um and

04:19:31.840 --> 04:19:35.429
it. So this is how you can manage um and set limitation how many times to apply

04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439

Okay, let's continue.

04:19:42.800 --> 04:19:45.990
Okay, let's continue. And what we have here, we have here

04:19:45.990 --> 04:19:46.000
And what we have here, we have here

04:19:46.000 --> 04:19:49.990
And what we have here, we have here again the reference to the buy x get y

04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000
again the reference to the buy x get y

04:19:50.000 --> 04:19:55.429
again the reference to the buy x get y discount. Um a bit more complex uh

04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439
discount. Um a bit more complex uh

04:19:55.439 --> 04:19:58.550
discount. Um a bit more complex uh uh taken into account.

04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560
uh taken into account.

04:19:58.560 --> 04:20:01.910
uh taken into account. This combinations of this setup either

04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920
This combinations of this setup either

04:20:01.920 --> 04:20:05.910
This combinations of this setup either take x + y or only y separately and

04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920
take x + y or only y separately and

04:20:05.920 --> 04:20:08.710
take x + y or only y separately and depending on uh either this is

04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720
depending on uh either this is

04:20:08.720 --> 04:20:12.710
depending on uh either this is percentage or uh percent type or amount

04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720
percentage or uh percent type or amount

04:20:12.720 --> 04:20:15.510
percentage or uh percent type or amount type

04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520
type

04:20:15.520 --> 04:20:17.510
type just as a difference you might see that

04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520
just as a difference you might see that

04:20:17.520 --> 04:20:20.870
just as a difference you might see that it is a bit more it contains a bit more

04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880
it is a bit more it contains a bit more

04:20:20.880 --> 04:20:22.710
it is a bit more it contains a bit more logic.

04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720
logic.

04:20:22.720 --> 04:20:26.229
logic. Okay. And um here we have some kind of

04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239
Okay. And um here we have some kind of

04:20:26.239 --> 04:20:31.030
Okay. And um here we have some kind of explanation how this uh u calculation is

04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040
explanation how this uh u calculation is

04:20:31.040 --> 04:20:33.750
explanation how this uh u calculation is performed depending on a either we are

04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760
performed depending on a either we are

04:20:33.760 --> 04:20:38.149
performed depending on a either we are selecting um each y item separately or x

04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159
selecting um each y item separately or x

04:20:38.159 --> 04:20:41.670
selecting um each y item separately or x + y total

04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680
+ y total

04:20:41.680 --> 04:20:45.830
+ y total u this is u that I've just u the same

04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840
u this is u that I've just u the same

04:20:45.840 --> 04:20:48.469
u this is u that I've just u the same case I've just demonstrated you in a

04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479
case I've just demonstrated you in a

04:20:48.479 --> 04:20:52.309
case I've just demonstrated you in a shopping list and the last type of uh

04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319
shopping list and the last type of uh

04:20:52.319 --> 04:20:55.349
shopping list and the last type of uh discount ount is shipping. So shipping

04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359
discount ount is shipping. So shipping

04:20:55.359 --> 04:21:00.630
discount ount is shipping. So shipping discount is applied uh for the checkout.

So these three types I was just demonstrated they were applied uh for

04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760
demonstrated they were applied uh for

04:21:05.760 --> 04:21:08.149
demonstrated they were applied uh for the shopping list and then transferred

I guess subtotals or subtotal uh value

04:26:05.359 --> 04:26:07.910
I guess subtotals or subtotal uh value need to check documentation but more

04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920
need to check documentation but more

04:26:07.920 --> 04:26:10.950
need to check documentation but more than uh 500.

04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960
than uh 500.

04:26:10.960 --> 04:26:15.189
than uh 500. Let me check my notes in a second.

04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199
Let me check my notes in a second.

04:26:15.199 --> 04:26:18.070
Let me check my notes in a second. What should be the

04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080
What should be the

04:26:18.080 --> 04:26:21.910
What should be the uh whether I write subtotal? Mhm.

04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920
uh whether I write subtotal? Mhm.

04:26:21.920 --> 04:26:24.950
uh whether I write subtotal? Mhm. Without value. I will demonstrate where

04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960
Without value. I will demonstrate where

04:26:24.960 --> 04:26:27.990
Without value. I will demonstrate where you can pick up those

04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000
you can pick up those

04:26:28.000 --> 04:26:31.269
you can pick up those examples for the expressions. Okay, I

04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279
examples for the expressions. Okay, I

04:26:31.279 --> 04:26:33.910
examples for the expressions. Okay, I will save the changes. Now I have a

04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920
will save the changes. Now I have a

04:26:33.920 --> 04:26:36.389
will save the changes. Now I have a restriction within an advanced

04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399
restriction within an advanced

04:26:36.399 --> 04:26:38.630
restriction within an advanced condition. The promotion should be

04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640
condition. The promotion should be

04:26:38.640 --> 04:26:41.590
condition. The promotion should be applied uh only when we have subtotal uh

04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600
applied uh only when we have subtotal uh

04:26:41.600 --> 04:26:45.349
applied uh only when we have subtotal uh 500 uh US dollars. I will refresh the

04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359
500 uh US dollars. I will refresh the

04:26:45.359 --> 04:26:51.750
500 uh US dollars. I will refresh the page.

04:26:51.760 --> 04:26:54.389
Now the

04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399
Now the

04:26:54.399 --> 04:26:56.070
Now the uh promotion is not matching the

04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080
uh promotion is not matching the

04:26:56.080 --> 04:26:59.990
uh promotion is not matching the condition. We have uh uh subtotal uh

04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000
condition. We have uh uh subtotal uh

04:27:00.000 --> 04:27:03.670
condition. We have uh uh subtotal uh less than 500. Promotion is not applied.

04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680
less than 500. Promotion is not applied.

04:27:03.680 --> 04:27:12.389
less than 500. Promotion is not applied. Let me add it.

04:27:12.399 --> 04:27:15.030
I will add it. Return back to the

04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040
I will add it. Return back to the

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:17.510
I will add it. Return back to the checkout.

04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520
checkout.

04:27:17.520 --> 04:27:20.149
checkout. Go through the same steps.

04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159
Go through the same steps.

04:27:20.159 --> 04:27:23.349
Go through the same steps. And now I have subtotal greater than

04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359
And now I have subtotal greater than

04:27:23.359 --> 04:27:27.349
And now I have subtotal greater than 500. The promotion is applied and the

04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359
500. The promotion is applied and the

04:27:27.359 --> 04:27:29.910
500. The promotion is applied and the discount is calculated based on percent

04:27:29.910 --> 04:27:29.920
discount is calculated based on percent

04:27:29.920 --> 04:27:37.750
discount is calculated based on percent type which is uh $2 US.

04:27:37.760 --> 04:27:40.469
And again you can yeah the whole idea is

04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479
And again you can yeah the whole idea is

04:27:40.479 --> 04:27:44.469
And again you can yeah the whole idea is uh within a shipping uh discounts is to

04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479
uh within a shipping uh discounts is to

04:27:44.479 --> 04:27:46.950
uh within a shipping uh discounts is to give this discount depending on some

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960
give this discount depending on some

04:27:46.960 --> 04:27:49.189
give this discount depending on some specific shipping method you would like

04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199
specific shipping method you would like

04:27:49.199 --> 04:27:54.790
specific shipping method you would like to promote.

04:27:54.800 --> 04:27:57.830
Okay, within the schedules uh as usually

04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840
Okay, within the schedules uh as usually

04:27:57.840 --> 04:28:01.189
Okay, within the schedules uh as usually you are just trying to automate uh the

04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199
you are just trying to automate uh the

04:28:01.199 --> 04:28:06.389
you are just trying to automate uh the process uh uh when the promotions at

04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399
process uh uh when the promotions at

04:28:06.399 --> 04:28:08.469
process uh uh when the promotions at what period they should be applied and

04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479
what period they should be applied and

04:28:08.479 --> 04:28:10.149
what period they should be applied and for that you have activate and

04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159
for that you have activate and

04:28:10.159 --> 04:28:15.110
for that you have activate and deactivate uh time uh frames and uh you

04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120
deactivate uh time uh frames and uh you

04:28:15.120 --> 04:28:17.990
deactivate uh time uh frames and uh you can have a collection of that there is

04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000
can have a collection of that there is

04:28:18.000 --> 04:28:22.229
can have a collection of that there is no need u there is no like calculation

04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239
no need u there is no like calculation

04:28:22.239 --> 04:28:24.389
no need u there is no like calculation performed under the hood. So if you have

04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399
performed under the hood. So if you have

04:28:24.399 --> 04:28:27.590
performed under the hood. So if you have this schedules uh

04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600
this schedules uh

04:28:27.600 --> 04:28:31.030
this schedules uh nothing could be happened in a in a

04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040

04:28:31.040 --> 04:28:33.189
nothing could be happened in a in a background uh to decide whether

04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199
background uh to decide whether

04:28:33.199 --> 04:28:35.750
background uh to decide whether promotion is applied or not because this

04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760
promotion is applied or not because this

04:28:35.760 --> 04:28:38.389
promotion is applied or not because this is uh just fetched using a promotion

04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399
is uh just fetched using a promotion

04:28:38.399 --> 04:28:41.670

apply uh based on expressions.

04:29:23.040 --> 04:29:24.950
apply uh based on expressions. Yeah, with this we you you will have

04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960
Yeah, with this we you you will have

04:29:24.960 --> 04:29:27.429
Yeah, with this we you you will have this u the visibility the promotion

04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439
this u the visibility the promotion

04:29:27.439 --> 04:29:31.429
this u the visibility the promotion visible only for some u targeted

04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439
visible only for some u targeted

04:29:31.439 --> 04:29:34.630
visible only for some u targeted customer or customer groups or depending

04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640
customer or customer groups or depending

04:29:34.640 --> 04:29:38.309
customer or customer groups or depending on some uh

04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319
on some uh

04:29:38.319 --> 04:29:41.030
on some uh conditions uh advanced conditions like

04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040
conditions uh advanced conditions like

04:29:41.040 --> 04:29:43.590
conditions uh advanced conditions like subtotals or or any other and let's

04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600
subtotals or or any other and let's

04:29:43.600 --> 04:29:45.910
subtotals or or any other and let's actually check what kind of expressions

04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920
actually check what kind of expressions

04:29:45.920 --> 04:29:49.670
actually check what kind of expressions are accepted for promotions. So we can

04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680
are accepted for promotions. So we can

04:29:49.680 --> 04:29:53.189
are accepted for promotions. So we can rely on some uh financial attributes

04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199
rely on some uh financial attributes

04:29:53.199 --> 04:29:57.110
rely on some uh financial attributes like uh we were doing that subtotals you

04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120
like uh we were doing that subtotals you

04:29:57.120 --> 04:29:59.590
like uh we were doing that subtotals you may promote using some specific currency

04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600
may promote using some specific currency

04:29:59.600 --> 04:30:03.510
may promote using some specific currency for uh euro provide a discount while for

04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520
for uh euro provide a discount while for

04:30:03.520 --> 04:30:06.309
for uh euro provide a discount while for US dollars do not provide a discount. uh

04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319
US dollars do not provide a discount. uh

04:30:06.319 --> 04:30:09.030
US dollars do not provide a discount. uh promoting some specific uh payment

04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040
promoting some specific uh payment

04:30:09.040 --> 04:30:12.550

04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720
cost which is calculated some

04:30:14.720 --> 04:30:18.950
cost which is calculated some geographical u attributes like depending

04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960
geographical u attributes like depending

04:30:18.960 --> 04:30:21.750
geographical u attributes like depending on a billing address that customer uh

04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760
on a billing address that customer uh

04:30:21.760 --> 04:30:24.389
on a billing address that customer uh specified in a checkout or shipping

04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399
specified in a checkout or shipping

04:30:24.399 --> 04:30:27.510

method depending on a customer customer

04:30:27.520 --> 04:30:32.229
method depending on a customer customer user entities and so on. So quite

04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239
user entities and so on. So quite

04:30:32.239 --> 04:30:37.110
user entities and so on. So quite uh large list of uh possible uh options

04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120
uh large list of uh possible uh options

04:30:37.120 --> 04:30:40.229
uh large list of uh possible uh options to be taken into account for this u

04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239
to be taken into account for this u

04:30:40.239 --> 04:30:44.550
to be taken into account for this u expression.

04:30:44.560 --> 04:30:55.510
Oh yeah. and the list of operators

04:30:55.520 --> 04:30:58.070
when we were adding uh which items we

04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080
when we were adding uh which items we

04:30:58.080 --> 04:31:01.510
when we were adding uh which items we prefer to have

prefer to have

04:31:01.520 --> 04:31:04.229
prefer to have uh as a discount

04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239
uh as a discount

04:31:04.239 --> 04:31:07.910
uh as a discount uh items to discount. we were selecting

04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920
uh items to discount. we were selecting

04:31:07.920 --> 04:31:10.229
uh items to discount. we were selecting uh them either manually I've picked up

04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239
uh them either manually I've picked up

04:31:10.239 --> 04:31:13.670
uh them either manually I've picked up for the last one I guess this one or we

04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680
for the last one I guess this one or we

04:31:13.680 --> 04:31:18.469
for the last one I guess this one or we were using uh this u form to select by

04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479
were using uh this u form to select by

04:31:18.479 --> 04:31:21.590
were using uh this u form to select by some uh advanced filter then we that's

04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600
some uh advanced filter then we that's

04:31:21.600 --> 04:31:24.550
some uh advanced filter then we that's usually can excluded from those which

04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560
usually can excluded from those which

04:31:24.560 --> 04:31:27.429
usually can excluded from those which were picked up automatically exclude

04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439
were picked up automatically exclude

04:31:27.439 --> 04:31:29.990
were picked up automatically exclude some some items

04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000
some some items

04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:33.429
some some items let me close this part

04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439
let me close this part

04:31:33.439 --> 04:31:36.469
let me close this part and the last thing uh related to This

04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479
and the last thing uh related to This

04:31:36.479 --> 04:31:40.469
and the last thing uh related to This topic is uh about coupons. So right now

04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479
topic is uh about coupons. So right now

04:31:40.479 --> 04:31:43.910
topic is uh about coupons. So right now we were using uh the the promotion was

04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920
we were using uh the the promotion was

04:31:43.920 --> 04:31:48.550
we were using uh the the promotion was triggered based on the uh

04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560
triggered based on the uh

04:31:48.560 --> 04:31:50.950
triggered based on the uh the condition which was met. For

04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960
the condition which was met. For

04:31:50.960 --> 04:31:53.429
the condition which was met. For instance, subtotal

04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439
instance, subtotal

04:31:53.439 --> 04:31:57.030
instance, subtotal u unit uh of quantity was matching the

04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040
u unit uh of quantity was matching the

We can specify uh what kind of coupon

04:41:49.920 --> 04:41:52.310
We can specify uh what kind of coupon codes we would like to generate either

04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320
codes we would like to generate either

04:41:52.320 --> 04:41:55.830
codes we would like to generate either case insensitive or or not. And we are

04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840
case insensitive or or not. And we are

04:41:55.840 --> 04:41:59.110
case insensitive or or not. And we are also able to uh fi to define the

04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120
also able to uh fi to define the

04:41:59.120 --> 04:42:02.070
also able to uh fi to define the strategy uh by which we are defining

04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080
strategy uh by which we are defining

what promotion to to apply either

04:42:05.920 --> 04:42:08.708
what promotion to to apply either combine all discounts. So imagine user

04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718
combine all discounts. So imagine user

04:42:08.718 --> 04:42:11.270
combine all discounts. So imagine user has order total discount shipping

04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280
has order total discount shipping

04:42:11.280 --> 04:42:14.390
has order total discount shipping discount. So both will be applied for

discount. So both will be applied for

04:42:14.400 --> 04:42:16.868
discount. So both will be applied for the

04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878

ordering or we can select and apply best value discount. So the the highest uh

04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560
value discount. So the the highest uh

04:42:26.560 --> 04:42:35.990
value discount. So the the highest uh discount will be applied on the

04:42:36.000 --> 04:42:39.670
and now we are finishing with the uh

04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480
is reflected in a storefront and we

04:42:52.480 --> 04:42:55.990
is reflected in a storefront and we might find the differences uh so uh

04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000
might find the differences uh so uh

04:42:56.000 --> 04:42:59.590

coupon uh related to the promotion you already have in a checkout. Let me read

04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440
already have in a checkout. Let me read

04:48:57.440 --> 04:49:02.390
already have in a checkout. Let me read once again. Can a single promotion rule

04:49:02.400 --> 04:49:08.390
apply?

04:49:08.400 --> 04:49:10.708
No, no, no. If uh yeah single code is

04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718
No, no, no. If uh yeah single code is

04:49:10.718 --> 04:49:13.990
No, no, no. If uh yeah single code is applied for single promotion.

04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000
applied for single promotion.

04:49:14.000 --> 04:49:15.750
applied for single promotion. Yeah. So the idea was how do you get

04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760
Yeah. So the idea was how do you get

04:49:15.760 --> 04:49:18.470
Yeah. So the idea was how do you get like free shipping and a price discount

04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480
like free shipping and a price discount

04:49:18.480 --> 04:49:20.230
like free shipping and a price discount on the order at the same time. So it

04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240
on the order at the same time. So it

04:49:20.240 --> 04:49:21.510
on the order at the same time. So it sounds like the only way to do it is

04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520
sounds like the only way to do it is

04:49:21.520 --> 04:49:23.670
sounds like the only way to do it is with two separate promotions

04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680
with two separate promotions

04:49:23.680 --> 04:49:27.030
with two separate promotions and only through conditions not through

04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040
and only through conditions not through

04:49:27.040 --> 04:49:29.270
and only through conditions not through uh one code or or you can't do multiple

04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280
uh one code or or you can't do multiple

04:49:29.280 --> 04:49:30.470
uh one code or or you can't do multiple codes either.

04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480
