# Training Day 3 Summary

## Key Topics
- Advanced Data Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling (Standardization, Normalization)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Handling Imbalanced Datasets (Oversampling, Undersampling)

## Detailed Summary
Day three of the training series delves into advanced data preprocessing techniques essential for building robust machine learning models. The session covers feature scaling, including standardization and normalization, followed by dimensionality reduction methods like PCA and t-SNE. Finally, strategies for managing imbalanced datasets, such as oversampling and undersampling, are explored. Participants are encouraged to apply these techniques to their projects and ask questions.
